But it seems like its not going anywhere anymore. We fight so much that sometimes I just miss my freedom and not feeling this crappy. But were both in university right now studying for our degrees and it just seems to be such a scary time to go through a life-changing breakup. We have changed each other so much. Its so selfish but hes almost all that I have. I dont want people talking. I dont want people asking. Its like I want to go through a breakup where no one knows. At the same time, we really love each other. Its not the type of relationship where we fight over nonsense things. We both want to be better and were both trying hard because giving up on each other isnt a choice. So, Im scared that Im walking away too easily.",

    "title": "First-Time Buyer Dilemma: Affordable First Bike vs. Long-Term Investment? Pulsar N250 vs. Triumph Speed T4",
    "text": "Hey fellow riders! Im 23M finally ready to buy my very first motorcycle! Im torn between two options: Budget: upto 2.5L. Priority : Need stylish, reliable ride for city occasional highways. Dilemma: Start with an affordable bike now and upgrade later OR invest in a pricier bike to keep for 5 years. Option 1: Pulsar N250 1.85L Affordable, low maintenance Good first bike, easy to upgrade later Might outgrow power/style in 2-3 years Very common less unique/exclusive Option 2: Triumph Speed 400 2.5L Premium build, long-term keeper Better highway performance Costly upfront maintenance Too much for beginner? Few questions I have: 1. Better to start small then upgrade? 2. Is 400cc too ambitious for a first-time rider? 3. How good is the resale value for bikes like the N250 after 2 to 3 years? 4. Are service and parts for Triumph, KTM, or BMW significantly more expensive than Bajaj or TVS? 5. Any other good alternatives I should consider around 250cc under 2 lakhs or near 400cc up to 3 lakhs? Test rode N250 and really liked it, but the Speed 400s looks honestly haunt my dreams. Would love to hear your experiences and suggestions. Thanks in advance for the help.",

I already know people always say dont shit where you eat or get your honey where you make your money etc lol. Im not here for that, Im going for it. I work for a bank in a huge corporate building so we dont really work near each other, I just always walk past her desk when Im going to the break room because its on the way. We work in two different departments if that matters. I feel like a 100 dweeb but shes so pretty to me and I like what I like lol. Ive been thinking about an approach for a while now but the absolute last thing Im trying to do is make it uncomfortable or weird for her because its her job and I dont want her to feel obligated or like she cant reject me if not interested I wanna leave the ball on her court. So I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper and I really really wanna give it to her today. I swear Ive been wanting to do it for weeks but Ive chickened out every time but now Im at the point where Id rather get rejected than not know if theres a chance. She could end up being the one for all I know lol. TLDR: I like a girl at work but I dont wanna make it weird for her or myself by asking her out directly.",

    "title": "Car Accident - Injury Lawyer - What the Heck is Going On?!",
    "text": "Location: Texas BACKSTORY WITH CAR ACCIDENT About a year ago, a distracted driver ran into the back of my car and totaled it. Very annoying obviously. But moreso that I was very close to paying it off completely and loved the car. Thankfully, the at-fault admitted fault immediately so this wasnt a battle. We moved onto appraisal pretty quickly and I found a shabby-but-fine replacement car. The check I got after settlement from at-fault drivers insurance paid off the rest of my car loan, put me in an objectively worse vehicle, and prolonged how much longer I have to make payments so ultimately screwed me over financially and made me pretty depressed. The day of the crash, I went to the ER because I smacked my face into the steering wheel, the back of my head on the head rest, and my neck was in a lot of pain. The ER said I had Acute Whiplash and sent me on my way. START OF LAWYER ENGAGEMENT AKA TREATMENT PHASE A friend told me to look into a personal injury lawyer given the steep price of medical attention and my lack of health insurance. So I did, and this is where the fuckery started. My billboard-having, personal injury lawyer set me up with a chiropractor. They gave me some sort of x-ray and started cracking away. 75 of visits, they stuck me on a massage bed, asked me what level I wanted it on 1-10, turned out the lights, then sent me home afterwards. A few visits in, they tried putting this thing on me to shock my pain area, but it fucking hurt so I said no more. On lucky days, I got the mall-grade massage bed AND had my neck and spine cracked by guys that could hardly pronounce the name of their profession. But whatever, lawyer told me to go, I went. I asked if I was going to be on the hook for these things, they said no, so I said why not. After a few sessions, lawyer tells me to get a referral to get an MRI on my neck - which I do, once again making sure I wont be on the hook for this, to which they assure me I wont. So I go, they put me on the machine at this obscure laboratory, and its done. The MRIs come back fine. Nothing severe. A week later, this lawyer calls and says do you want to get anymore MRIs? Cause you could do some more, you know, just to be sure. I tell them I dont want anymore cause I dont need anymore. They insisted a few more times, then in frustration, gave up and set me up with a Pain Management Specialist to see what sort of beneficial treatment I could get. I go to the Pain Management Specialist, and this quack-ass-motherfucker QAMF starts telling me my back and neck doesnt look bad, but that if I wanted, I could still get AN EPIDURAL, SOME SPINE INJECTIONS, AND MIGHT EVEN CONSIDER SOME NECK/BACK SURGERIES. I tell them to fuck off entirely and that Ill never come back. My lawyer asks me how it went, and if Ill be going to anymore appointments with the Pain Manager. I told her no, cause that QAMF wanted to do expensive and permanently damaging things to me for no reason at all. After this experience, I have about 5 chiropractor appointments left until my case can move on from the Treatment phase. The lawyer once again asks if I want to move forward with any other MRIs or Pain Management treatment. I tell them no, and that I just want to do the Chiropractic appointments and be done. NEGOTIATION PHASE Finally, I finish with the appointments. I wait 4 months and dont hear anything, so I call the lawyer and ask whats up. They tell me the bottleneck is the QAMF not sending over a form that says Id rather not have FUCKING BACK SURGERY OR EPIDURALS THAT I DONT NEED. So I call the QAMF office and tell them to fucking step on the gas. Finally finally, we get to negotiation. This is where Im pretty confused and where I become nervous to be involved. My lawyer has apparently collected all my bills never shared with me and sent them over to the at-faults insurance and has fought for a settlement. Im notified that theres a settlement negotiation for me to sign without being told anything or adequately explained what I was to sign. I had to request they call me to tell me wtf is going on. Ill use fake amounts, but this is what the new person that I wasnt introduced to from the law firm calls and tells me: So what weve been able to do for you, you have two options. Either 1 we pay your medical bills from the total settlement 30,000 and you get a check for 5,000 OR 2 you sign the agreement we sent you, and then we send you a check for 10,000 and you pay your medical bills yourself directly. Bigger check sounds nice, huh? So This person that called me from my lawyers office, that Im speaking to for the first time, I ask them what my medical bills total to. They tell me they total to about 17,000, but that theyre pretty confident Id be able to negotiate the payments down enough to where I could end up with more money on my end than if I just let them pay and took the 5,000. The more questions I asked, the more agitated this new legal friend became. Im not a math expert, but the numbers made no sense to me, and I was not understanding how the option I was being urged to choose option 2 was in my best interest. I told them I wanted to see all of the medical charges and see both options laid out in the individual agreements before I planned on signing anything. In a pouty and bitchy tone, he said, Option 2 will get you a bigger check but I can send over the agreements for both options. For the next few days, I received notification after notification telling me the option 2 I pay the providers settlement agreement was ready for my signature - with no sign of the option 1 they pay the providers agreement for my review. But now it gets even more fun. With my ER visit, I was invoiced 6,000 for two CT Scans and an IV. On the settlement agreement, the visit was listed at 17,000. I call the law firm and ask about why the ER visit is so much higher on the agreement, and they say its because hospitals will always quote the services much higher when a lawyer asks, versus when a patient asks, and that by calling them on my own and fulfilling on-my-own the lawyers advertised obligation of negotiating on my behalf, I can for sure get the bill reduced much lower than they could. Looking into the ER bill myself, I had an uninsured driver discount that was applied a few months after the accident, but was then waived several months later for some reason. Calling billing at this hospital routed me to an off-shore customer support rep that told me there is no one he can route me to to discuss the discount or negotiate the bill. This would be my last touchpoint with my new legal friend. I call the firm again and they connect me with the firms finance guy that they mustve forgotten to tell me Id be working with from here on. I try to get vulnerable and real with the Finance guy at this law firm that Ive been suddenly transferred to with no formal hand-off or mention from any previous lawyer. I explain my financial hardship to them from this situation, the pain Ive ended up with, and my lack of knowledge in this area. I ask them to level with me and tell me if theres a reason they want me to take Option 2 over Option 1. Like, will they receive a bigger cut? And they say no, theyll be taking their 10,500 35 cut off the 30,000 settlement total regardless. After getting real, he tells me Option 1 is probably safer for me and insists they cant help with negotiations if I were to do Option 2 because patients are much more successful negotiating directly than if they include a lawyer. Once again, weird. ON-MY-OWN-APPARENTLY PHASE At this point, I am still not wanting to make a decision. Im confused about why Im being urged in one direction over the other. I also dont see three of the medical charges listed on the settlement agreement that my lawyers are considering in the we aint paying document. Chiropractor, the MRI, and the QAMF Epidural idiot are not listed as charges Id be on the hook for, but he verbally says I would be. So I ask how much additional that would be. He tells me Maybe like another 1500 for the Chiro, since it was a few back cracks and majority massage beds. The MRI - well that might be in the neighborhood of 1,500 but not my concern since they said I wouldnt be on the hook for something they urged me to go do, right?! And I assumed probably just another 100 or so for the Pain Management QAMF, since all I did was go there, let him feel me up, and then let him suggest nonsense to me that I denied. Should just be another 3100 between the three, right? So maybe totaling me at 20,100? Right?! Wrong again. I finally see my Chiro bill since the Lawyer and Chiro worked directly together on my behalf, and the bill was a total of 8,000 for the 18 visits. But how? Well the bed they put me in for 10 minutes most visits was 100 a visit. The visits that had the bed and adjustments, 275 per visit. Then they also had a few x-ray charges sure and assessments/evaluations to show progress fine. What intrigued me was the 75 per visit total 1350 for an icy-hot-patch equivalent I never once received during any visit not fine, listed all up and down my invoice. And the therapeutic exercises I mustve forgotten we did which added 350 total to my bill trash. And oh yeah, the daily living exercises, adding another 200 lies. And the last, a set of adjustments done from back to back visits which they never did after explicitly saying adjustments would be done every other visit - however the bill charges me for adjustments 2 visits in a row 200. So Im pissed about this obviously. Im on the hook for 8,000 for the Chiropractor I was told I wouldnt be on the hook for, and it appears 2,100 at least of that is bogus charging. But at least that QAMF Pain Management person didnt charge me much for me simply telling them I didnt want any pain management assistance, and that I desired zero needles in my back, right? Nope, that No I delivered cost me 2,200 - a balance of which my lawyers said I wouldnt be on the hook for. Oh, and the MRI they said I wouldnt be responsible for paying, turns out that was 2,500, and oh, it is on me to pay. HELP ME NOW PLEASE So to try to keep up with the math Lawyers are taking their hard-earned 10,500, leaving me with 19,050 to pay remaining bills. But the remaining bills: - 2,500 MRI - 8,000 Chiro - 2,200 Pain QAMF - 17,000 - ER TOTAL: 29,700 - Meaning if I took their Option 2, Id have 19,500 to pay the medical providers and would be in debt for -10,200. But Option 1, I get a check for 5,000, they get one for 10,500, and Im only only left with 12,700 in outstanding medical bills, leaving me -7,700 CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WTF IS GOING ON. HOW IS THIS A THING? WTF HAPPENED? 1. How is it that Im solely on the hook for medical treatment they recommended and told me I wouldnt need to pay? 2. Why are they the law firm urging me to waive their need to pay? 3. Is negotiating with medical providers a thing? Could it be as drastically reduced as the law firm claims? 4. Please share any other thoughts, wisdom, personal experiences, insights, words of encouragement, advice, or pity. Thank you if you read all of this. This was cathartic as I feel Ive been banging my head against the wall.",

But when it came to respecting boundaries, especially around physical stuff, he slowly started pushing mine even though he knew about my past trauma. Ive walked away now, and Im trying to stay firm. Still, my mind keeps going back not because he was perfect, but because he felt like home for so long.

    "title": "I got a ticket for making a right turn on a nonturning lane",
    "text": "Location: NYC I was driving home on Sunday night after having Mothers Day dinner with my family and got a ticket a street away from my apartment. I was approaching an intersection with a right-turn lane and there was a car stopped at the corner that lane, not moving, with their hazards on, just sitting there while the traffic light was green. I did what most people would do and went around the stopped car using the adjacent lane and made my right turn. Literally right after, I was pulled over by a police officer who claimed I made an illegal turn from a non-turning lane. I told the officer that there was a car blocking the turning lane. Of course, he denied seeing any vehicle there and then returned to his car to run my information. He could have just walked back to confirm that there was indeed a vehicle there. I knew at this point he was set on giving me a ticket so I asked my passenger to run back to the corner and record a video of the stopped car. The video was taken at 10:41 AM three minutes after the time on the ticket, which was 10:38. The cars hazards werent on in the video but it was clearly stopped in the right-turn lane and the light was green at the time. My friend told me the guy who was parked there got out to ask them why they were recording and that they had their hazards on and were planning to leave soon. Thankfully we were able to get a 8 second video of the car before he left. The officer finally returned around 1015 minutes later, he had a second officer with him and handed me the ticket. I attempted to show him the video on my passengers phone, but he refused to view it and simply said I should dispute it in court. When I asked what I was supposed to do in a situation like that? Where a car is stopped in the only available turn lane, the officers changed their story. They claimed the vehicle was not stopped, and there were multiple vehicles in the lane waiting to turn. At this point I pulled out my camera because they kept switching their story. They saw the camera and told me I can just dispute the ticket if Id like but I kept asking and literally had to beg them to repeat statement of what happened. They changed their story again and on camera they said there was a vehicle in the right lane about to turn, with its blinkers on. Since there was a stopped car on the corner of the turning lane the said turning car would have also had to go around.Also the street that the said vehicle and I were turning onto is a dead-end street, and I didnt see any vehicles behind me other than the cop car. I was literally staring at the cop car behind me so if a car was truly turning, I would have seen it but there was no car, which contradicts their claim. Unfortunately, I dont have a dashcam something I now plan to invest in, but I do have a witness and a recorded video showing the obstruction shortly after the ticket was issued. Im going to plea not guilty but not sure if the evidence I have will get the ticket dismissed.",

    "title": "Coworker is cheating the system, do I speak up?",
    "text": "I started a new job this year and I am in a small office with two other employees. One of them is working the same position I do and we are both paid hourly so we have to clock in and out for lunch, etc. I noticed pretty soon that this coworker seems to come in late a lot and instead of the 30 minute allotted lunch break, she will be gone for an hour and a half to two hours every day . I usually come in early so I can take a longer lunch but even then I have to be cautious to make my 40 hour week every week. I do not understand how she is supposed to get to 40 hours being gone so much and have cautiously tried to bring up the topic with her to which she would just respond that she will sometimes stay late to make her hours. Now I have never actually seen her stay late and she will typically leave before I do. I have caught her in a couple white lies like saying she and her partner do datenights on Wednesdays and then the next week she would mention that they always do date nights on Thursdays or that she said she came in late to make some more notes and accounts, and when I checked for her notes, she did not log any, so this has led me to believe that she does not clock out for her lunch break and even then Im not sure she makes her hours. I did the math and I think she may be getting up to 200 a week for time that shes not actually in the office and I feel like that is not fair. She will also randomly disappear for up to 30 minutes during the day, multiple times a day and Im pretty sure she goes and sits in her car to play on her phone. I will preface this by saying I am someone who gives 120 at work regardless of what job it is and I do understand that it is unreasonable for me to expect other people to have the same work ethic I do, but I have certainly noticed that I process most of the accounts in the office And at the end of the day we get paid for the same hours when she puts in very little work. I dont have a problem with her being gone so much or working less because at the end of the day all our work is documented and that is her deal and none of my business, but I do take issue with her logging hours that shes not there and getting paid for them . My problem is I dont know how to approach this since Im new. There is another department in our office with other people in this coworker seems to be friends with all of them. I do not want to become the office bitch. I dont want her to get in trouble, but it has gotten to a point where I am constantly annoyed at work Because all the work is left to me. I have wondered if there is personal stuff going on and have tried respectfully ask her if everythings OK she did mention that her sister is struggling with addiction and she seems to be getting calls from her kids school a lot but again I can get over having to leave for phone calls. I can get over having to do most of the work, but I feel like she should be honest about it and if there is an agreement with our supervisor about this, I feel like she wouldve told me when I asked. Do I ask her directly? Do I accuse her of not clocking out? Should I go straight to my supervisor? I really dont know what to do here and would appreciate some insight from other people. Do I just keep my mouth shut because Im new?",

But Anyway she says my blankets stink and is stinking up the dyer and washer. For info my room does stink for multiple reasons that just stacked on. My room used to be a porch we just put up some walls so theres no ventilation but a lil a/c unit. All the pets reside in my room we have a cat and two dogs they each have a kennel with bedding plus a steal litter box. Before the pets my room still smelled of dust/sand cause of all the cracks and is stuffy. My mom argues that my bedding smells like cat piss honestly I cant smell it neither my lil sibling along side shes spayed and correct me if Im wrong she says the pets hair when I was thier bedding will break the machines witch I think is bull. When I do wash I make sure to tub wash at least 2 to 3 times and wipe the sides. She just thought of the idea and I know shell being bringing it up over and over. I know that shell argue that itll be selfish or embarrassing but I dont feel comfortable going to the laundromat to wash all those blankets itll take hours and I have a fear that someone will take em. So I need advice on how to keep more tidy room and points on not going to the laundromat.",

    "title": "Just found out my 22 year old niece had a baby",
    "text": "I just discovered my 22 year old niece had a baby last month through a random encounter with her friend while grocery shopping. Weve been distant for over a year, and Im concerned about her situation. To give some insight, my brother was in a relationship with my nieces mother a long time ago. They were young and the pregnancy definitely wasnt planned. When my parents found out, they were supportive and offered to help but my brother was apathetic and clearly didnt want to be a father and he eventually split up with my nieces mom. So sadly, he didnt have much to do with my nieces mom during the pregnancy and even though he was paying child support after she was born he just wasnt very involved. When my niece got a little bit older my brother had custody of her every other weekend but instead of spending time with her he would drop her off at my parents house and go out with friends or his new girlfriend. I was in junior high at the time so I would often help my parents babysit my niece and we all loved spending time with her. In a way, its like we raised her for my brother when hes the one who should have been doing that. As my niece got older, she stopped wanting to go with my brother when hed pick her up for his weekend. Shed say things like mom says youre a deadbeat and grandmas not my mom. My brother started getting annoyed by this and eventually stopped picking her up for the weekends. My parents and I were obviously devastated because we were the ones spending time with her. My mom tried calling my nieces mom but she never answered her calls. My parents tried to stay in touch with my niece but since she was so young there wasnt a way to reach out other than speaking with her mom and her mom just wasnt interested. Over the years we sent things like birthday cards and Christmas presents but we never heard back. Then, out of the blue, when my niece was 15 years old, she called my mom crying and asked if she could move in with my parents because her mom and her new stepdad were being mean. None of us had heard from or seen my niece in close to a decade. My brother included. Long story short, my niece moved in with my parents and lived with them until she was 21 years old. From years 15-21 it seemed my niece was doing well. She was getting good grades in high school and after she graduated she started community college with plans to transfer to a 4-year for nursing. Everything was great and then she started hanging out with a girl who was much older than her and a bad influence. My niece started partying heavily and making bad decisions. She dropped out of college and eventually decided to move out of my parents house and stay with the friend. We still kept in touch here and there via text but my niece stopped visiting my parents. She even stopped coming by my place to visit me. So other than texts at birthdays and holidays we didnt have any contact and didnt see each other in person. The last time I saw my niece in person was November 2023 and now a little over a year later shes had a baby. I feel so sad for her because I know it wasnt planned and I know things are going to be difficult for her from here on out. The last time I saw her she didnt have a job, didnt have any savings, and was dropping out of school. I cant shake this feeling that I let her down and maybe I should have tried harder to take care of her. After finding out shes had a baby I sent her a generic text asking her how shes been and if she needs anything, a text I would normally send her. I didnt want to tell her that I know about the baby because I didnt want to make her feel awkward. For the first time, she did not respond to my text. I guess Im posting on this sub because Id like to know what you all think. If you were me, what would you do? I feel so sad for her and would like to help her but dont want her to feel pressured to reach out to me. Your advice would be appreciated!",

A month went by and I texted her to check in to see where we stand and she said she still needed time to think about it but that we should go our separate ways and not to wait for her so I thought fuck it shes obviously not interested or cares about losing me so I just accepted the reality of it and just said its better to both acknowledge that it will never work and its fine, no hard feelings. Then I just asked her if she would be interested in something casual not expecting her to say yes but and said she never considered that but was interested. The next day shes saying Ive been on her mind a lot. Now shes saying how incredibly horny she is for me and wants to come over tonight. I thought I wouldnt have feelings for her anymore because she clearly wasnt interested in dating me anymore but now Im not sure if its even a good idea because I might still have feelings.",

I am insecure about certain things, yes. I feel like he trying to get under my skin or something. Hes so also liking weird posts on instagrams that are about micro cheating, how women should look, or provocative women. It doesnt help me when I also dreamed of him cheating on me a few days ago. Example of his snarky remarks : Imagine how it must be to have such a nice face but no nice body or an ugly face with a nice body Its hot when business women wear tight skirts and shirts to work Men do such more than women When I confront him about things that make me uncomfortable he usually gets mad and makes me feel guilty for mentioning anything by saying you dont trust me, youre toxic, youre dumb.

    "title": "friend confessed a month after I broke up with my partner of 8yrs - how do I respond?",
    "text": "First time poster. Pretty much what the title says. My friend 25M, my ex 26M and I 25F have all been friends since high school and even lived together for a few years. We have a pretty close dynamic but Ive always sensed something different about the way he interacts with me, almost like he puts me on a pedestal and is super protective. He acts this way with his female family members as well so I mostly chalked it up to him wanting the women in his life to feel secure and respected, which is nice, but he also can be really pessimistic about things which is a reason why Ive taken some distance. My partner and I broke up about a month ago, and since then this friend has been reaching out more frequently to catch up or spend time together. I recently went out to celebrate his sisters birthday with the whole family as weve all grown very close over the years. Well yesterday out of the blue I get this insanely long message from him. Its not even a confession - mostly just a stream of consciousness saying that hes made assumptions about how I feel Im assuming that Im not into him??, but certain things in our dynamic have blurred the lines i have a guess as to one of these as he mentioned one time in high school when my ex and I were fighting I tried to kiss him when I was blackout drunk, so he wants to know whether I have feelings for him and has been agonizing every hour over it. To be honest I had a feeling in the back of my mind that he might have deeper feelings but this message was really a HUUUGE shock!! I feel kind of frustrated because he knows how much emotional trauma Ive been through and how much Im trying to focus on myself and my own healing. Ive opened up to him a lot since the breakup about how difficult things have been. This just doesnt even seem like the right time or place to be considering my emotions towards anyone else as Im still currently living with my ex, planning to move in just a few weeks, and reeling from the tumultuous past few years of that relationship. How do I express all of these feelings to him without hurting him?? Hes the type of guy who really keeps things bottled up and then just sends cryptic messages like this, so I always feel like Im digging for the subtext. I really do care about him as a friend and our relationship has never been COMPLETELY platonic but I cant see him giving me what I need whatsoever in a relationship right now - and regardless, after 8 years of monogamy Im just beginning to even consider other people in that way so I have no clue how Im expected to answer the question if I have feelings??? Majorly confused and Ive just left him on read so looking for some kind of advice on how to respond here.",

SO RECENTLY Ive been in charge of cleaning the home top to bottom on my days off, sometimes doing laundry if required bc usually thats my spouses chore I feed/bathe dogs if needed due to the recent raining months its been more frequent, I make sure to do the errands like getting groceries or items we need in the home. usually if my spouse works at night if Im off I tend to make lunch before she heads off, well I cant say she does the same usually on her days off she sleeps all day doesnt care for much of the dogs like to take out from the kennel for potty reasons or bothered feeding them at a reasonable time, she says she will do laundry but yet again all the dirty clothes are left in the dining room on the ground which will be left there for days or never does them. The kitchen will be a mess it takes about 3 days for her to get to it. She heavily relays on door dashing as dinner for us, which Im over it. Usually on our bed everything gets thrown to my side such as clothes or towels that are dirt. We have argued about it recently and it always come back to how tired she is or she doesnt have time. I just feel like Im drowning and our intimacy its almost like once a month bc of my choice I just find it as a massive turn off or maybe even the lack of respect when I feel like Im the one having to do everything in the home and when I pled for help or tell her Im starting to feel depressed its always Ill try better, but it just doesnt happen. I have noticed my mood as been up and down once moment Im angry or sad or somewhat happy then normal. Im starting to loose faith if this is the person who I wanna be with, Im always thinking is it always gonna be like this bc I just dont think I can deal with it that long anymore WHAT CAN I DO TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION ?",

I was charged with: 1. DRIVER ENGAGING IN EXHIBITION DRIVING WITHIN A SPECIAL EVENT ZONE Must appear in court 2. NEGLIGENT DRIVING UNDER TR 21-901.1 WITHIN A SPECIAL EVENT ZONE 530 fine 3. DRIVER SKIDDING/SPINNING WHEELS UNDER 21-1117 IN SPECIAL EVENT ZONE 530 fine 4. DRIVING MOTOR VEH. IN MANNER INTENDED TO CAUSE EXCESSIVE NOISE 70 fine I didnt think I did enough to get the spinning wheels as I really do not think my tires were spinning enough to skid. I was pretty upset about that and got snippy with the officer. After I calmed down I apologized to the officer and he accepted my apology and told me to see him the morning of my hearing and he will remove 1, 2, and 3 and only charge me with the 4. Excessive Noise. Should I still hire a lawyer or will I be ok to just show up and speak to him before the hearing??? I really dont want to do any jail time or lose my license Ill pay the fines if I have to. Location: I was charged in Maryland and I reside in Pennsylvania.",

We separated late February but I read we have to be separated a year before we can go through legal proceedings? It seems insane. We had no legal agreement prior to marriage, no shared property, no mutual bank accounts etc. So there is nothing to argue about. Im 34 and theyre 30 so we are relatively young. I saw you could get divorced after 6 months but it required a prior agreement? I feel Im misunderstanding the law I also have no interest in dealing with them, would it be best to hire a lawyer to take care of everything? Thanks!!",

My girlfriend is extremely against going to the doctor and will not go under any circumstances. I have been with a multitude of women and would and would always wonder why they didnt end up pregnant or at least miss a period. All of a sudden she became pregnant and didnt want to get too excited as she felt the excitement would cause her body to malfunction and destroy the unborn. While the common reaction would be to get a DNA test she has always been against those as well. Im confused on the whole matter and maybe miracles really do happen but something isnt adding up.",

    "title": "Gas Company Wrongfully Shut Off Gas",
    "text": "Location: Houston, Texas I recently had a bizarre and annoying situation with my gas provider and was just curious about the legality of it all. In my house the hot water heater is the only thing that uses gas so when the hot water heater stopped working on Friday we told the landlord and he sent a plumber. The plumber then discovered the gas had been turned off and locked by the utility company at some point. We then call the utility company and they said someone reported a leak so their tech turned it off. At no point did the company call, text or email me or the landlord and didnt try to get in contact in any way. Im in a connected townhome and the neighbors gas wasnt disconnected and they werent contacted which makes it doubly weird. I ended up having to pay 2 different plumbers and leave work early twice to have the gas reconnected after 6 days of no service. Everyone I interacted with was stumped and said this was very weird. Both plumbers were confused, one thought we were being pranked or something and even the tech from the gas company was asking me a bunch of questions because it was so weird and hed never had this happen before. When I called the company help line they said they left a note on the door which was no where to be found but that was the only contact they made. They were kind of rude so I just dropped it in the end. My question is two-fold. First is it legal to contact someone by a note on the door like that instead of mailing, calling, emailing, etc. And what wouldve happened if there was a leak and people or my pets were harmed because they didnt contact me in a normal fashion. Im not actually going to do anything else or pursue it any further I was just curious about the legality of this behavior. Im so sick of the sketchy utility company monopoly in my city lol.",

    "title": "Should I rent and prioritize peace, or stay in a toxic household just to save money?",
    "text": "Im 24 F, and Im stuck trying to decide if I should move out and rent to prioritize my peace of mindor stay in my current living situation with my dad and save money, even though its draining and toxic. Background: From 1618, I was completely independent. I was in school full-time, working full-time, and living in my own condo. My credit was excellent, and I had a strong head on my shoulders. At 18, I got into a relationship with a man 12 years older that became emotionally, physically, and financially abusive over six years. I lost my independence, my financial freedom, and my mental stability. Things spiraled worse during the breakup, when I also got into a car accident that left me unemployed and without transportation. As a result, I now have around 30k debt in collections, 10k in student debt, and a credit score in the 500s. Where Im at now: I live with my dad rent-free, which allows me to put almost all of my income toward debt repayment and savings. I work full-time remotely and make 70k base with potential to earn 100110k through commission. My car is paid off, and I only pay for insurance and my phone. Im in a stable place mentally and feel really focused on rebuilding my life. But the living situation is really taking a toll on me. I live with my dad, stepmom, and little brother. Its not peacefulits tense and emotionally heavy every day. My dad and stepmom barely speak. Theres constant passive aggression, weird dynamics, and a lot of toxic behavior that honestly triggers memories from my past abusive relationship. On top of that, I dont get along with my stepmom. She does bizarre things like putting the garbage bin on the kitchen counter even though my dad installed a custom pull-out drawer for it, piles up everyone elses stuff while leaving hers everywhere, and has even thrown out or burned my dads belongings without asking. She pays zero bills and is extremely controlling, while my dad just tells me to ignore herbecause he cant stand her either. Anytime I try to speak up, it creates chaos. So now I just stay quiet and walk on eggshells. Its draining and honestly makes me feel stuck and resentful. My dad encourages me to stay longer so I can save, even suggesting that once Im on my feet, he plans to divorce her and sell the house. But that adds even more pressure, because I feel like me being here is part of the reason hes holding offand that just makes me feel guilty. I know hes not happy, and I hate feeling like Im somehow enabling the situation by staying. Also worth noting: Im single, child-free, and not currently interested in buying a home. Id rather travel more and have the freedom to live life on my termsso owning property isnt even a priority for me right now. What I need advice on: Should I stick it out, stay with my dad, and keep saving aggressively to clear my debt and stack my savingswhile sacrificing my peace and mental wellbeing in the short term? Or is it smarter to move out and rent a place of my owneven if it slows down my financial progressso I can protect my peace, heal fully, and finally have some independence and stability again? Im torn between whats financially smart and whats emotionally healthy. If youve been in a similar positionor have any insight at allId truly appreciate your thoughts.",

    "title": "Should I confess more?",
    "text": "A long time ago, but during my relationship I was in a chatroom together with my friends where you can anonymously talk with people. We just did it for funs sake and trolling, but we came across a guy who told us that if we insult him hed send money to us. I thought the Idea was dumb but actually did it and thought it was funny that someone enjoyed when u cursed at them. I thought it was a quick way of making money so i actually insulted him and he actually sent money. When he was curious of how I looked i just sent him fake pictures I remember it clearly of some random girls i found online, i never showed my face and the only information is maybe name and surname because of PayPal in my country. After that day, i called him on another occasion three or four more times to insult him so he payed. The problem here is that in the middle of the call he started to ask me to say sexual things and became more demanding and I did it, it was my biggest mistake and I feel sick and get a lump even now when i think about it. I told him sexual things I know he wanted to hear happened 2-3 times and after that i blocked him and never talked to him. Because it was almost fully anonymously i genuienly didnt see it as something deep or serious because people i knew had done this and it was purely out of financial gain and i didnt care about the guy. After a while has passed one year or so i suddenly remembered it my stomach twisted. I couldnt handle the pain and guilt and i felt it was extremly wrong, how couldnt i have known it then, of course i was more immature but still. I though that because i didnt take it seriously back then it wasnt serious but i was completely out of touch with reality, what i did was wrong and seriously wrong and shameful. I felt nauseous for a long time, i couldnt sleep or eat and I cried almost every single day for a long time. It haunted me and occupied every part of my mind. After a while I couldnt hold it in so I told my boyfriend about it and cried so hard I said i am so sorry and i deeply regret it. He was a little dissapointed and told me it was not good but still understanding because i was immature and I told him i wouldnt do this ever again and have never done it. Now after a while I happen to think about the situation and a new memory popped up to me, its a memory i cant remember exactly but it feels like it happened but its not a fake memory because i dont doubt if its happened i doubt more like what exactly i did, a memory of me showing my bra for 3 seconds or something like flashing it in the call. This detail i havent told my boyfriend yet because i just got it in my head, and I am afraid it changes the core of the story because i didnt remember it the first time i told him about this. I feel so anxious and dont know if i should tell him or let it be. I dont want him to relive the trauma of opening up the story again for no reason but at the same time i dont want to hide important information that I know hed leave me for. This is so hard I have thought about it everyday and I am suffering i cant eat or sleep, but I seriously think about this 24/7. I know ive done something big that is actually wrong and i dont know how to handle it. I dont want to lie by omission and i feel like i have to tell him this. Is this something I have to share to him I seriously cant make a judgement right now.",

Shes wanting to go into law enforcement and start her career as a cop. I love her and Ill always support her but it scares me. She knows I dont like it although Ill always support her decision and we have talked about the future and our plans before so this isnt really new info. The problem is that everyone I tell has something negative to say about her being a cop including my family and hers. As much as I want this to last Im honestly just not sure I can deal with the constant stress of her not only being in danger but also surrounded by all male co workers. Im not really insecure or anything and I absolutely trust her I just struggle to see myself being happy in the future. Any advice is appreciated, especially if youve been with anyone in a similar profession or situation. Ive been thinking about this a lot lately and have been talking to my family and close friends quite a bit but I still dont really know which direction this could end up going. Id hate to see it end because of this and Ive always told her to never let me get in the way of her future career or anything like that but I also cant shake the feeling of how miserable I might be down the road. I guess I just want to see what everyone else thinks and if anyone has any insight from being in a similar situation.",

    "text": "For some added context: -Weve been together almost 2 years -Im openly bisexual -I was previously married to a man at 19, divorced at 22 -Before my ex husband and bf, I only dated women Title kind of says the rest. Ive been sitting on this ball of guilty pondering for a couple of weeks. I know I love my boyfriend, and he loves me, but I find myself growing more and more disappointed in the way men love I know its not all men, just bear with me here. I could write all the reasons I do love him, but to summ up: he does try to understand me, is open to constructive criticism, and has similar life goals to me. Every relationship Ive had with a woman has been so fulfilling. Theyve seen me for who I was without expressing wants for me to change my personality and desires. With both men Ive been with, I cant say the same. In my current relationship, my bf talks about not being physically attracted to me because Im larger than him Im curvy and muscular, hes lanky, but Ive never even heard a woman Ive been with approach saying this. He also dislikes that I enjoy tattoos, piercings, and body mods. Weve had conversations about this, and he simply says that men place more stake in the physical attraction than women do--not that it outweighs emotional attraction, just that they care more about how their partner looks. It also comes down to things like when he is frustrated, or just upset, and follows the same line of thinking Ive seen countless men do the world is against me, upset tones towards anyone, yelling outbursts, though he does recognize and clarify these actions are never towards a person, just frustration with the situation. There are times when he has to be told to comfort me, and when we have emotional talks, he gets quiet and is unsure what to say. I know this could be a degree of emotional immaturity, but I find myself falling into the mindset of hes just a man. And that simply isnt satisfying. And its in direct opposition to any experience Ive had with a woman. Emotional awareness was big in all of my relationships with women, and I find them to be much more emotionally mature than men. I also find women as a whole to be more interested in who I am beyond physical presentation, and are open to serious conversations more than men. So, to you, redditors, I ask: does this sound like a case of emotional immaturity? Is it comp-het? Do I just have a talent for picking bad men? Any advice helps 3",

He has had a couple health scares over the past year or so. I love my dad and I know it bothers him that I dont see or check on him as much as he would like me to, but every time I see him he says or does something gross. He breaks his neck looking at very young girls. There is a girl that walks her dog through the neighborhood and he always talks about the cute chick with the dog. Shes in high school. He complains about being single and the fact that the only women who would want him are old dude, youre 62 If a woman is young and decent looking, hes respectful. If shes older or overweight, hes condescending and makes fun of her after she leaves. Like hes messing around with his buddies or something. I see the way he treats women differently and it grosses me out. Its gotten to the point where hell make one comment and then Im just ready to distance myself from him for a while. My wife agrees with me but doesnt really take it to heart. It doesnt seem to gross her out like it does me. Am I being a prude? Would this be a big deal to anyone else?!",

    "text": "Im worried as my girlfriend, who is 17 F and also a shorty at 52ft, has stated that they are experiencing some bleeding in their Vaginal area as well as some itches, burning, pain that they describe as stretching pains and pains in the abdomen and lower areas. Theres been cramping pains but not like period cramps, nor is the blood from their period. They believe that there are things out of place down there damage inside the vagina And sometimes there is pain inside the vagina and the lower abdomen when they are penetrated because there seems to be something in the way something sticking out that is blocking the penetration. The last couple weeks they have been peeing much more than usual even though their water intake has not changed. When they do feel the need to pee its instant and feels like they really have to go right at that moment. I feel that it would be important to note that my lover has had a past with molestation and sexual assault including in the last year. I find that it would be very appreciated that I can find some knowledge or advice on what might be happening to my love and to keep all answers respectful, thank you.",

I brought a property development company with my father a few years ago and contributed 40,000 initially and have made additional payments of 20,000 starting last year. The property value has increased year on year of 7, so this is roughly an increase of 10,000 in capital gains which means I would be owed roughly 60,000. I live in one of the properties, but have since decided to move on. My father is well off and funded the development and is able to pay me back and will pay the capital gains on the initial 40,000 I contributed as he said this is fair. My stepmother, on the other hand, isnt the most brightest or perhaps shes trying to short change me and says because I didnt spend money on the building costs that I wont get back all what I put in and/or capital gains. This is completely silly to me of course someone should get paid back what they contributed. Ive been paying off my loan which is through my father of 250,000 weekly. The reason Im getting out is because while this company is directed and co shared by my father and I, I prefer being independent from her and Im chosing to live abroad.",

    "text": "Bought a new 2024 VW Atlas Cross Sport December 2024 total out the door 50K. At the time, my husband was making 72K per year and I was making 75k per year. I didnt need the vehicle but I justified it because I wanted AWD, I was getting a 9/hr raise, we could afford it, and I never treat myself to anything. Fast forward to May 2025, my husband got laid off and is trying to find something else comparable, I now make 93K soon to be 98K but have been paying some of his portion of the bills for the last month or two. We can make ends meet and have a little bit extra to save but I just cant stop feeling like I need to find something more practical without the 750/month payment. KBB and Carmax show I am upside down 15K ouch, but to be expected. Do i just ride it out and keep trying to put as much towards the new car as possible? Should I try to find something cheaper thats still reliable and roll that over into the new car which I dont think is even possible? Or sell the vehicle and buy a cheap car with savings 3-4k?",

    "text": "Location: Illinois. Hi, the tldr is I sometimes do uber eats for extra cash. It was slow so I signed up for a promotion. The promo was 16.50 per hour, on top of tips, between 5pm-7:58pm and you could only turn down one offer per hour. I worked it and was notified in an in app pop up that said I had completed the promo. They do this daily. I worked one hour of a 16/hr promo a diff day before realizing I was missing my funds from the prior 3hr. In total its 65.50 Im missing. I have all the evidence via screen shots I worked it, ss of agents telling me I will be receiving the funds on a certain day and then not receiving them. ss of another agent telling me the funds were included in the 90 you made that day I asked so if its included in the 90 I would have only been able to withdraw the tips from that, not the 49.50 from the hourly promo as well? That would come on pay day? He confirmed and I said Great! Then I didnt get it, as you can see in this screen shot in app I withdrew all 90 immediately meaning they were exclusively tips. Ive emailed 3 times about it and they havent gotten back when they quoted me 24 hrs. I will not speak to anyone at uber about this unless it is in writing anymore lol but yeah Im petty and I have the time. Im also mad Uber is fucking me on like 70 bucks in any economy",

    "title": "How to deal with partner F male co worker revolver?",
    "text": "Mature convo and advice please I know this topic has been discussed many times and 95 of men would agree that females and males cannot be friends, I am in that camp Just some backstory, been together with fiance for over a decade. Great down to earth girl, no previous partners, and respectful. I am much more confident, however she is not known to seek any male validation before and has had male friends before me which I accepted. Over the past year Ive been struggling with accepting partners co workers. It got forced on me sort of, my fiance has opened up about coworkers being friends, to which I initially tried to support until lets call him Jose single and 27 has started to push the boundaries and got too comfortable by texting almost daily including nightly, have competitive banter, even touch doing stupid pranks like chin tags, poking. Note out of the few male coworkers he is the only one I know to text her after work and have extended work calls. Ive met him a few times and he is beta like all of her colleagues but thats beside the point. Now she tells me everything but I couldnt help to get frustrated hearing the competitive stories and her yap about him Now my fiance has told me all this however I put my foot down as soon as I noticed a gradual shift in attention. I reinforced my boundaries and told her that I am not comfortable with her receiving constant attention from her male co worker. He even bought her a birthday gift which I said is a big no. I told her about the fact this can lead to emotional cheating. After a decade I went through her phone after one night she laughed at a convo they were having and I got upset. I found that as suspected that Jose was in fact being sneaky and playful, his intentions were from my point of view more than a friend suggesting competitiveness, trying to over share and constant texting on the weekends and nightly. He even sent a heart emoji on three separate occasions. My blood was boiling. Now my fiance didnt entertain him and was cordial but still. Its clear hes a revolver waiting for his turn. I laid out what I said was strict boundaries. That work friends should mostly involve just work and discussions are to be there mostly. That if the competitive banter, texts or extended calls didnt end I would look at her different. The thing about my fiance is she is the most genuine person I ever met. Like too good naive type. Not the typical horror stories you hear about emotional cheating/physical type. But this did raise red flags that she didnt know how to handle this situation Heres the kicker? We have an event/ concert with her work friends coming up and they asked to crash at our place to which I said no. Now here is where I need advice From our last convo it seems to have gotten better. No late night texts or extended calls from what i know. However I am really tempted to lay the law down with Jose once and for all and pull him aside, telling him about my boundaries. I need to be careful I dont blow the lid off the wall since I trusted my fiance to deal with it. However Im thinking this needs to come from me and I need to assert my dominance on him and let him know after work calls, texts and banter including physical touch is not okay, and if he doesnt respect that he doesnt respect our boundaries I hate revolvers as much as anyone. How did you deal with your partners co worker? How did it end up?",

    "title": "Landlord pushed me into psychosis, then tried to trap me in 40K debt now Im rebuilding from bankruptcy and need advice/validation",
    "text": "Hi Reddit. Im a 30F who filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy this year 2025, and Im still trying to process what happened to me last year and how insane this system is. In 2024, I was illegally evicted, and the trauma of the eviction the pressure, threats, and stress triggered a full psychotic episode. I couldnt function. I wasnt okay. And while I was in that state, they sued me for back rent and damages without properly notifying me and got a 21,000 default judgment. Now heres the kicker: When I filed bankruptcy, my lawyer found that they had filed the same debt twice: Once under my landlords names 21,058 And again under their law firms name 21,148 Same debt. Same event. Slightly different amount. A new lawsuit. A duplicated filing that I never wouldve seen if my attorney hadnt caught it. So basically, they were trying to make it look like I owed over 42,000 for a single eviction which, again, literally broke my mental health. Im worried they might try to file it again post-discharge under a different name or sell it to a shady debt buyer. Heres where Im at now: Living with family to recover and stabilize Studying for my CPA Ive got 1.1 years left Working fulltime as an accounting clerk Not trying to move out yet I need time to save and rebuild The 21,000 judgment was reported on my credit Im not expecting to rent for at least another 23 years, but I want to be smart about it My questions: How long does it usually take to be able to rent again after a bankruptcy rental judgment on your credit? My eviction is sealed. Location: California Has anyone dealt with duplicate or inflated debts filed in bankruptcy by a creditor? Can I take legal action or request sanctions if they try to collect again post-discharge? Any tips on how to legally protect myself after discharge? Or how to set myself up to eventually rent again with confidence? I dont expect a miracle. But I do want a clean break and I dont want to get hit again by the same trauma, disguised in a different envelope. Thanks for reading. Im fighting. Im healing. But damn, it would help to hear from anyone whos been through something like this.",

    "text": "Im in the US and need legal advice on a retailer issue Acme Tools that canceled my orders 35489714, 35489706 after shipping. I used a valid coupon for 100 off at checkout, paid any remaining balance, and got shipping confirmations FedEx. Days later, they canceled, logging returns as if I requested them, citing I was charged the wrong amount. I didnt authorize these returns. Their terms Section 2.g state shipped orders are accepted, forming a binding contract per UCC 2-206, I believe. They cited Section 2.e cancellations for incorrect price/rebate, but the coupon was a valid promotion, not a pricing error. Their returns seem deceptive, possibly violating Minnesotas Deceptive Trade Practices Act Minn. Stat. 325D.44. They offered 10150 coupons, which exclude the brand Milwaukee Tool and have high minimums 751500, far from fair compensation. I emailed Acme demanding fulfillment or a replacement order at 50 off, with a May 16 deadline, but no reply. I posted about this on r/MilwaukeeTool for community input and shared proof on Twitter/X AcmeTools, u/MilwaukeeTool. Im a tool enthusiast love Milwaukee, PB Swiss Tools and trusted their promo, but feel scammed. Questions: 1. Can I argue a binding contract was formed once they shipped, per their terms and UCC? 2. Do their fake returns violate consumer protection laws Minnesota or federal? 3. Should I file complaints with the BBB, Minnesota AG, FTC, or my states consumer agency? How? 4. Any other legal steps e.g., small claims court? I have proof order confirmations, shipping notices, return records, emails. Planning to escalate to BBB/FTC if unresolved. Any advice appreciated!

However, this girl and I have been talking for a couple weeks and thought it was a super special and cool idea to have our first date as her being my plus 1 for my friends wedding. I asked her a couple times if she REALLY wanted to do it, so we did it. We both connected really fast and got deep in some different conversations. We talked on the phone for nearly 4 hours this past weekend and talked about how we saw a future with each other and wanted to truly see this out. Here and there, I would ask her if she was worried about anything, didnt think anything of it. We had a really strong convo yesterday that ended with me asking if she had any doubts. Her mood changed and 3 hours later, texted me back saying that she didnt want me to be portraying any fears. The convo ended fine though and we moved on. I wake up today, she changed a picture on her Hinge profile after saying she paused it yes I know Im crazy for looking, but I had a weird feeling this morning and she hasnt texted me in 7 hours. Seems to me Im getting ghosted after something that felt so real. I just dont know why it was looked at so negatively to ask her if she had any doubts.",

    "text": "Hi! Im new to Reddit. I 31F made a post for financial advice on how much I should pay my parent to rent a room in their house. I added some financial history for context and I tried to keep a balance between being vague and giving relevant details. I guess I didnt do a good job because people immediately picked up on the anger/resentment I have towards this parent because I feel like their financial choices in the past contributed to some of my current financial woes. I tried to acknowledge that now, at my big age, I just need to deal with my circumstances. But I guess my acknowledgement was missed. I ended up deleting the post and some of the comments. But you know, Reddit doesnt really delete anything. Anyway, I feel TERRIBLE about it now. The guilt is nauseating. I also struggle with anxiety. I wonder if I overshared. I feel like my frustrations are invalidated. And I just wonder if theres a bigger picture Im missing. I know my parent is just human and is prone to mistakes. But I wonder if maybe I shouldnt have come looking for sympathy for this situation. I dont understand why people are always reactive when I share my thoughts and feelings. That said, how do I improve my character and integrity? Im human and struggle with some feelings. But does that make me a bad person? How do I improve my character so Im not coming off as a disgruntled brat all the time? I want to be more active online and share my experiences, but I dont want to be treated like a bad person for having difficult feelings. How do I find the balance? Im trying to be brave and taking a second chance with this post",

The limitation of other agents like Figma AI is that you have to pre-define all tasks and execution functions. We are now seeing a new paradigm which is computer-vision based agents. You give them screenshots and they give out actions. Google Project Mariner uses such approach. The limitation of browser based agents like Google Project Mariner are that they dont have the context of your whole web application. Why is plusma.aihttp://plusma.ai different: We first index your web application Learning phase: This is where the agent learns to use your application. You give it the url along with demo credentials of your application. It will crawl through and create a proper documentation of how to use your product. You can then integrate this agent to in your web application. Now the end-user can ask the agent to use your web application for him. Example customers of plūsma: Canva, Zoho, Figma, Jira etc. Future: The agents like Google project-mariner will catch up and will know how to use all the standard applications. We, by that time will have the index/data of all applications that was captured in the Learning phase Screenshots, flows, etc.. We, then create a foundational model like https://generalagents.com/https://generalagents.com/ an index engine like google crawler.

    "text": "We first got together 25 years ago. We have two children 11F 9F. Its hard to remember and write everything but Im trying to process and need some help. I am down, I am sad, I am feeling alone. I had suspicions throughout our relationship and we went through couples therapy in 2014/2015 as I found messages/evidence of cheating when I was pregnant with miss 9. 3 years ago I found out it was bigger than that, that he has a sexual addiction and had been sleeping, messaging, fantasizing and masturbating daily. He is now in recovery, I know this to be true. From reddit I believe I went down sub holes r/loveafterporn r/AsOneAfterInfidelity I joined S-Anon I did therapy a little bit, he doe therapy. We did a little bit of relationship therapy. I struggle to open up and when I do, therapists questions if I should stay, that is my decision. Our daughters are different, as I am different, we fit in the neuro-diverse circles. My eldest is diagnosed autistic, she is book worm, fantasy lover, sport-disliker. She was quite rejected by her peers at the same time 3 years ago. My other daughter is explosive and diagnosed ADHD and takes Ritalin LA. They are wonderful and clever but we all dont think very highly of ourselves and all feel unliked in society. My eldest changed schools this year and that has helped outside our community. My youngest is improving all the time and does not have outbursts at school now, though I see some children are uncertain about her. My youngest actually said that Im so brave and always myself, but inside I feels like a fool around other parents and I feel judged because my children get rejected. Thats just a little bit about my family and internal struggles. This week my husband and I had a big argument about parenting. It was about fussy eating at the dinner table, my daughter refusing to eat fish and him telling her shes just going to be someone that eats chicken and chips and I felt like it was unnecessary laying into a child at dinner time. I feel he can be quite mean and negative. I did roll my eyes and tell him to just stop. When we discuss event this after he tells me that we need to be on the same page and I dont back him up, which I didnt, I agree. He then says that Im inconsistent and that hes tried my way and always does things my way and they dont work. Then as well says both Tell me what to do and well do it your way then or I just will stay silent and not do anything regarding them. Last thing he said was that he ..is worried that we are incompatible. Hes suggested couples therapy again. I am just tired of drama and unhappiness in our family. Do I need to keep trying, is this relationship salvageable, can I be ever feel happy again",

Today someone had my backpack and i constantly yelled their name and they were heading out to their cars and my gf was with them, i called out to my gf and she was the only one who turned around and i asked if she could go get it for me because i wasnt allowed to step off college property its a strict rule. she got visibly mad and had an attitude, she said why cant u do it yourself you werent even calling their name, i was literally shouting at them but they just ignored me. I just need to know what i should do, like if my girlfriend is right or not and if i should talk to her about it. i just dont wanna talk about it if shes acrually right about the whole situation since she often gets mad whenever i bring something up thats dumb.",

    "text": "Location: NC, USA Ive witnessed something very alarming at my new job and I dont know how to proceed, Im already on thin ice at my job. Client is a huge 20B company, I work for a 2B vendor for them, we give them people. Ill first tell you about what happened to me, and then will show what I think is a pattern and will express my larger concern. Me. Im onsite with the client. Last week this one guy loses his marbles during a business-related discussion in his office. He pulls me into his office and basically starts destroying me and my company, gets aggressive to the point where I dont feel safe anymore, I had to literally jump off my chair and stand by the door protecting myself with my notebook asking him to stop. He doesnt, I leave, he immediately calls my boss to take me off the project. Unfair, but there is more. I dont work for the client, he doesnt pay my salary, but he has created a situation of ohwhereareyoufrom or you get to keep my business. He knows I moved to another city for this job. Im now looking at termination. My company isnt handling it well, Im in limbo. Pattern. He forced us to hire a guy on a 30 day trial WITHOUT TELLING HIM. The guy also moved to be onsite, has no idea he can be fired with no notice. This same client often fires our people with no notice, and its always him or my business. He puts my team through a horrible scrutiny daily, and that day he had a thing with me Im 99 sure he was under the influence of... psychoactive substances. Off the record, Ive dated enough finance bros in NYC in my 20s to recognize the signs. My concern. This guy has put my literal well being in danger, not only during that meeting but to this day, I might lose the job for which I invest money into moving. Ill end up in red. He is about to do this to another guy. For no other reason than his sadistic pleasure. Hes literally blackmailing my company into breaking the law and they comply. Client provides healthcare-related services and works with people in vulnerable positions, what else do they do to their vendors? I imagine a scenario unplug this patient or youll lose our business. I dont know the exact nature of their business and their access to patients, but you see what Im getting at. I have direct orders from my company to not contact anyone from the client company directly. I kinda wouldnt mind compensation for what happened to me, but I also just cant walk away from seeing such injustice in action, I want him to stop. Also, I dont know if its just this guy, is he has support of his superiors in this. Would appreciate all and any advice.",

    "text": "Hi all. Id appreciate any advice about what Im looking to learn. Ive been watching longer videos on YouTube about different civilizations/empires, but the timelines of the videos can get confusing. Im gonna exaggerate slightly just so I can explain what I mean, but itll be something like first were gonna talk about sumer in 3000 bc estimating dates cause I dont 100 remember, then the Incas in 1000 bc, and then Egypt in 2000 bc, and then back to China in 3000 bc, etc Im wondering if theres a video that is heavily map based and more chronological. Like if theyre talking about western Europe or Rome during a certain period, its also mentioning whats happening in the far east or in the Americas at that same time so that way I could more easily understand which empires were around at the same time and who might have known and fought who. I hope that I described well enough what Im looking for and I really appreciate anybody that could point me in the right direction",

    "text": "Me f/22 and my boyfriend m/29 have been together for almost two years. We met when I was living alone in my own apartment. In August, I had to move, so we decided to live together. I was the only one looking for apartments because he was too lazy and would rather sleep all day he only works on weekends. I finally found a nice place and moved everything by myself he wasnt there, only my mom helped me. We had agreed that he would stay here only a few days a week because we both value having our own space sometimes, but he never sleeps at his parents house Now, he doesnt do anything around the house no cleaning, no cooking. Its extremely frustrating. Im in law school and working two jobs. Rent is around 900, insurance and electricity about 70 a month. He pays 350, but never at the beginning of the month I always have to remind him. Im starting to work extra hours next month just so I can pay the rent by myself if needed. He leaves his clothes everywhere, and I always have to clean up after him when he makes a snack. Hes extremely unreliable I can never make any real plans with him. Ive wanted a dog ever since I moved out. A month ago, I found a cute puppy online and prepared everything crate, insurance, bed, toys, etc.. I was going to take the bus 6 hours, but in the end, he drove me there 4 hours. Now he refers to the puppy as ours. He also tells his parents and friends that the apartment is ours his sister even says its his apartment, even though I pay for most things and the lease is in my name. Same with the dog I paid 2/3 of the cost, pay for the insurance and food, and do most of the care work. Hes currently at my place, but I want him gone so badly. Every time Ive tried to break up over the past six months, he gets angry and refuses to leave and just acts like nothing happened, continuing the relationship as if everything is fine. I think its so unfair how he takes credit for things Ive worked so hard for and presents them as his or ours. What can I do to get him to actually let me break up with him? If it werent for his stuff in the apartment and how he reacts, I wouldve ended things a long time ago what can I tell him to leave me alone without provoking a bad reaction? i just want this breakup to go smoothly.",

    "title": "Does anyone know about ren ?",
    "text": "Hello random question I dont know if I ask it here if this is the wrong subreddit I will take it down. Im a teenager and my mum is in her 50s recently she has really gotten into this 35 year old rapper named ren. I knew absolutely nothing about this man but its been months of her liking him and I cant say anything bad about him to her or it will upset her but Im really worried hes scamming people out there money. Anyone who knows anything about him will help !! Im gunna put a list of my worries of why Im asking this bellow but dont feel the need to read - Please know this is all I have put together from hearing about him and will be happy If Im told Im wrong. 1. He makes really odd music wich really is not my tastemight just me and his audience appears to only be 50 years old or mentally ill teens. And it seems hes only targeting this audience this is one of my main concerns of why I think hes off 2. Linking to point 1 He release tones and tones of merch which are all stupid prices. And advertises like hes poor and this is his last merch drop and needs the money then he does this back to back for like 5 drops of merch. My mum spent 150 on his merch shoes wich are knock of Adidas poorly made in china and shes bough like 4 pairs of them and then tones of hoodies all about 90 and then track suits trousers 70 and cheap figurines that are advised as super limited witch are all about 100 and then because his fans in my opinion vulnerable people then all sign up for his expensive patron to get early access because hes guilted them into feeling like their missing out or not supporting him. This all feels like making people give him more money to not miss out and manipulating people who dont know better 3. He never tours or anything, I understand his main thing is how hes sick and I hope out of everything this isnt something hes lying about but Im worried that is a sympathy grab again. 4. He writes creepy music about killing and raping women and teens. One of his songs in question about a teen being killed and abused is semi viral I believe and the other day I showed my mum adolescent and she wouldnt stop going on about how they stole the story from this ren dude. I explained how adolescent was not based on one specific real even and was about knife crime and spreading awareness and how it affects people. That got me thinking so I googled rens song violets tale which he claims to his fans is a true story he is telling for someone. But when you google it and properly look into it, it shows its not really about a real person at all. Which I think is a bit odd. 5. Final point. He has had multiple copyright problems. He either uses wrongly sold clips of really famous songs then claims he didnt know that they were stolen or someone elses even if its a really famous song clipped in tones of other famous songs that play everywhere. Or he uses someone else work. All I know is hes had a stupid about of songs and albums taken down to a point its odd I would be grateful if anyone can look into this man for me I dont care what you find. It would be a relief to know hes alright and I will admit that I was wrong if anyone can prove it. But Im so worried that hes manipulated my mum into spending thousands on him and done the same to others!!! I just want to know my mums ok or if shes in danger !!!!! Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!!!",

    "text": "hi reddit ive never posted on here before so im not sure on what to expect from this after a rough night on too much acid i came to the realisation that i am totally stuck in life and have been stagnant for the last few years. let me explain ive lived with my parents since birth and ive started to realise they might not be everything they pretend to be. my mum is incredibly fucking weird towards me and has been since i was a kid. especially around sex. wants to know everything. shes openly admitted i was an accident and i think she lies about how they both met because they said through a mutual friend but ive never met this mutual friend and dont even know their name. my brother left when i was a baby and never came back, i think theyre lying to me over why he did that. both sides of my family dont have good relationships with my parents, neither of them have any friends, my dad had open heart surgery and claims it was because of an accident he had in his teens but refuses to explain so i think it was probably drug related since they wouldve told me if it was genetic. although this is purely guesswork. both my parents are physically disabled and my mum is on a lot of heavy meds. oxys, tramadol, the lot. at one point she would come into my room and watch me sleep. ive been in and out of the hospital with both of them since i was a kid. i stumbled across porn at a very, very young age and their reaction was to tell my entire school, and when i had weird bouts of nausea and breathlessness as a kid they lied and told me i had hypochondria so any time anyone would ask what was wrong id tell them i had hypochondria thinking it was an actual medical condition and it took years for me to figure out they were just playing a sick joke on me. another thing is the fact my dad insists i keep find my iphone enabled so he can help me if i ever lose my phone, but i think its just a way for him to keep tabs on me. so now ive gotten my relationship with my family out of the way, lets cover the other things im currently finishing up on my second year of university. in my first i got assigned quiet accommodation due to applying late and lack of availability, so i met absolutely nobody in my first year. an old friend from home hanging himself made me give up on meeting people at all and i would just sit and drink in my room until i passed out and then id repeat. had some friends in second year but once youve spent enough time alone you stop working out how to communicate, so theyve not stayed. tried societies but theyre mostly lame if youre not into sports. i do have my best friend that studies at a different uni quite far away, hes the main thing keeping this ship together. i work 40/50 hour weeks outside of uni to pay for it, i pay for university myself since my student loan grant is minimum. so all my funds go toward that. id never been abroad until i turned eighteen since again my parents are disabled it was never an option. in the last year ive visited five countries, and im off to paris this weekend. all paid for by myself in the last year with money leftover from covering all my uni costs. not to suck myself off but im a pretty talented creative and thats where my passion lies. all i want to do with my life is make things and i know im talented enough and have the drive to make a career off it, because for me its literally everything, but i have no formal training or experience. ive worked in hospitality since the age of fifteen and my degree is in philosophy, so zero creative connections. i want to start afresh once i graduate. move to a new country completely. i have nothing to lose and will do whatever it takes to make it work. being from england i dont get the eu privileges, but the netherlands seems very welcoming through the zoekjaar scheme, since ill graduate from a top 200 university and will have the money to cover expenses. ive also been and could happily see myself living there. so. no friends, not a lot of family, spend every day working, a career that feels out of reach, but a complete drive to change. just stuck. any and all advice is welcomed. thank you if you made it this far",

I was in a meeting today with our new chief of DEI, who has a history of not being LGBTQ competent, and I gently informed him of some ways he previously harmed some members of our community misgendering, deadnaming in an effort to have an open dialogue and maybe see if he could humbly take accountability and he erupted on me and started yelling at me in front of 10-12 attendees. I was honestly very shocked. Im very vocal in my org but never disrespectful to management and Ive never been faced with that kind of defensiveness and hostility, let alone from a chief of DEI. I guess Im wondering if theres any legal recourse? Our HR complaint process is kind of BS because HR automatically sides with management and is very victim blamey in their investigation. I dont see any positive recourse coming from inside the org. Im unionized, but my union also has a history of not being supportive of LGBTQ staff. I have consulted with a delegate and we are talking about options but I want to think about any possible options outside of my org. Sorry if this is really dumb. Im feeling very vulnerable right now and I hope this can be taken in good faith.",

I dont know if hes always been racist and hid it from me and now its coming out or if its just a new thing. I love him but its getting really hard to deal with this. Were both white and I hate the thought of being with a racist but I dont know whats gotten into him. Between the bad sex and his behavior I dont know what I should do.

She keeps doing it no matter what, every time I tell her to stop she either calls me a psycho or just makes fun of me. She doesnt even take care of my stuff either, so i end up spending money only for her to ruin it basically for me. This has been going on for years, and honestly Im so fed up with it atp. Every time I tell my mother about it, she either talks to my sister then she SOMETIMES gives me my stuff back or she tells me not to be so dramatic about it and just leave her be, because shes moving out soon, but I cant take it anymore. I dont want to spend my money on stuff just so that she takes it away from me. While I save up my money to get stuff like clothes, books, stationary, makeup, games etc. She just spends hers on either going out to eat or on activities with her friends. I dont wanna have to lock all my stuff up in boxes or smth because its still my stuff that I like to display in my room, and its so time consuming to pack it up and unpack everythinh 24/7, I just want her to leave my stuff alone, I dont take anything from her either. She always makes fun of my interests and clothing style and calls me names but then takes said things herself? Im just so done and need advice on what to do. Should I always lock my room and pack all my stuff away, should I try to confront her again, just what am I supposed to do to make it stop?",

    "text": "Hi - recently my former abuser filed a bogus petition for an order of protection against me. He had a lawyer and I have five dollars til Friday so I acted pro se. I didnt realize until after but the judge totally skipped opening statements. He immediately let my exs attorney call me to the witness stand and question me. The attorney used Facebook posts from my alt account so it doesnt say my name anywhere, or my exs and I have a total of three followers in which Im writing about my experience with domestic violence. I objected to this being used as evidence because free speech and self expression but the judge overruled. The kicker is, they legitimately took words from my post that my ex had said to me, and used them as evidence that he needed protection. Im sure respondents often feel as if they were treated unfairly but I honestly dont think I ever had a chance. What are my options? Can I ask for a retrial? Please help! Location: SW Missouri",

    "text": "A few years ago, I shot several music videos for an artist who later blew up. At the time, I was paid very little about 600 per video through an informal agreement with their manager. I didnt realize the label had paid more for the visuals, and I never saw that money. Now, those videos have racked up tens of millions of views, and I still legally own the copyright to many of them. Lately, Ive been struggling financially. I spoke to a lawyer who said I may not be able to pursue full copyright damages because of how much time has passed, but I could still potentially recover 25k30k from the label or management for improper compensation. Heres where it gets complicated: The artist is currently in jail, and the situation surrounding them is dangerous not just career-wise, but in real life. I havent heard from their team in years. Theyve ignored my recent messages, and Ive already been blackballed by other artists and opportunities connected to them. I used to think I could build with them or work on future projects, but at this point, that door seems closed. Part of me wants to reach out to the manager and try to settle quietly. The other part of me feels like its time to stop hoping theyll ever circle back and just have the lawyer handle it. But I worry about burning bridges even though they havent treated me like a part of the team in years. This money could help me invest in my future and avoid total financial collapse, but I still feel torn. Am I crazy for feeling conflicted? Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Would you settle this directly, go legal, or let it go?",

We both wrote statements and they didnt believe us. So for the past week Ive put in 50 or so applications and only have heard back from two. I just finished my interview today but they said it could be a week until the 2nd interview/background check is ready. So if theres anyone out there who can afford to donate 1 Id be the most grateful person ever. I just have no idea how were gonna be able to afford food next week. And even if you dont have any money can you give me some advice or your story that may be similar to mine and how you got through it. Sincerely Jordan Cashapp 1ordxn",

Im trying to figure out the best way to use it, I see three options that all feel viable. 1. Put it in my emergency fund - I currently have a 3 month emergency fund, adding this paycheck to it would make it a little under 4 months. Its an a high-yield savings account with a 3.6 APY 2. Pay off my smallest student loan - I just started paying off my student loans at the beginning of this year so I still have a ways to go, but with this paycheck I could pay off the smallest one that has the highest interest rate of 5.5 3. Put in a Roth IRA - I have 401k that Ive been regularly putting money into, but my Roth has been pretty untouched since the initial deposit so this could definitely boost that I think theyre all good options, I think some are probably safer than others. For reference my student loan debt and monthly payments are not super burdensome so paying it off is not a massively pressing need for me. Id appreciate any advice, thank you!",

I was informed by the hiring manager that I would be required to print the forms HR emailed me, complete them and return them to the store location in-person. These documents require a significant amount of personal information such as my date of birth, address, SSN, proof of identification, etc. I dont feel comfortable submitting such an extensive amount of personal information in-person to someone who is not in HR. At my previous job with a different company, there was a secure way for new hires to submit the necessary information and documentation electronically through the companys onboarding platform. My previous manager did not request person information from me. Additionally, I was not asked to cover the cost of printing documents myself at my previous company. HR of the current company offered me only 2 business days to review the necessary documents before my anticipated start date. The timeline feels somewhat rushed. Additional context: I was hired less than a week ago. Id like to ask HR and my hiring manager if there is a way for me to submit the documents electronically through a secure channel. But Im not sure if I will be retaliated against for doing so. I would appreciate thoughts, guidance or feedback!",

    "text": "So my girlfriend and I recently broke up because she told after a really bad argument while I was in the train station waiting to go back home that something had happen to her and she couldnt tell me! After about an hour of prying trying to get her to tell me she ends up saying that she went out a month prior a week before our 1 year and got blackout drunk and woke up in another dudes bed and said that she was rped! Now this devastated me because obviously, thats a wild thing to hear from someone you love especially romantically but I got to thinking of how this wasnt the first time this has happened to her nor the second, third or fourth this now has been the fifth time shes gotten drunk and gotten taken advantage of and it also is the reason her ex broke up with her so knowing all of that and knowing we also argued that night really bad too before she went out I just dont believe she didnt cheat on me intentionally I think she just feels guilty and just is doing the most to clear her name. She wont go to the police, she at first lied to me saying she didnt know who he is and it turns out she does! And I asked her to give me his info so I can confront him and she wont! Like I want to believe her I just cant Ive asked multiple people woman and men and they all say the same thing and dont believe her either its just very unfortunate situation and Im really disappointed and depressed from all this what do yall think? Shes also diagnosed with bpd so everyday was torture and a constant battle I know I shouldve left before but I love her so much you know its hard to just discard someone like that.",

    "title": "Parental rights terminated unlawfully",
    "text": "Location: Kentucky So, I have a question. At the end We just finished a tpr hearing and my husband lost his parental rights to his daughter. He was pro se and the mother had a good attorney. Afterwards, When discussing the case with an attorney, I was told to request the final order.. and that it can take weeks to be signed because the judge has to review the evidence and apply the law. In Kentucky, in order for a TPR to occur.. at least one of the following had to have occurred: No termination of parental rights shall be ordered unless the Circuit Court also finds by clear and convincing evidence the existence of one 1 or more of the following grounds: a That the parent has abandoned the child for a period of not less than ninety 90 days b That the parent has inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon the child, by other than accidental means, serious physical injury c That the parent has continuously or repeatedly inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon the child, by other than accidental means, physical injury or emotional harm d That the parent has been convicted of a felony that involved the infliction of serious physical injury to any child e That the parent, for a period of not less than six 6 months, has continuously or repeatedly failed or refused to provide or has been substantially incapable of providing essential parental care and protection for the child and that there is no reasonable expectation of improvement in parental care and protection, considering the age of the child f That the parent has caused or allowed the child to be sexually abused or exploited g That the parent, for reasons other than poverty alone, has continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or is incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or education reasonably necessary and available for the childs well-being and that there is no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, considering the age of the child h That: 1. The parents parental rights to another child have been involuntarily terminated 2. The child named in the present termination action was born subsequent to or during the pendency of the previous termination and 3. The conditions or factors which were the basis for the previous termination finding have not been corrected i That the parent has been convicted in a criminal proceeding of having caused or contributed to the death of another child as a result of physical or sexual abuse or neglect j That the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the cabinet for fifteen 15 cumulative months out of forty-eight 48 months preceding the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights or k That the child has been removed from the biological or legal parents more than two 2 times in a twenty-four 24 month period by the cabinet or a court. Now, his child is 3 years old and he has never met her and he has been fighting to have a relationship with her since birth. What happens when the judge goes to apply the law but cant because there is no legal reason for him to lose his rights? When I was in court, the judge said 2 things - 1. that he abandoned his daughter for more than 90 after filing for paternity and then waiting 4 months to file for custody or file a response. During testimony, I couldnt recall all the details of that period so I said that I understood if thats true. 2. The second thing the judge said several times was that had he paid the previous 6 months of child support, there would have been no grounds to terminate. Nothing else was brought up to justify termination of rights. After I got home, I started looking through the entire case. He filed for paternity in February. He found out he was the father April 26th and he had an attorney by the middle of May. By the end of May, there was a petition filed by said attorney. Then hes filed responses, motions and etc ever since in order to meet and be a father. So therefore, theres no basis for TPR. In Kentucky, child support cannot be a reason for TPR. He quit his job in September due to the childs mother repeatedly filing false police reports and filed a dvo that was denied and he was working in the town she resides. He knew if he kept working there, she would eventually do or say something to get him arrested. This woman has a long history of doing anything to harm other people and history of refusing parental involvement for her other children. She retaliates if she feels slighted in any way. He missed child support in October, November and December. Then he paid just over half in January and February. Missed payments for March and April. He began school in February for CDL training and literally passed his test and received a renewed drivers license with endorsement for class A CDL the day before tpr. So even IF 6 months he didnt provide care.. which is not true, there is obviously reasonable expectation of improvement. All of this to say will the judge acknowledge her mistake and if not how can she possibly order termination?? The attorney said if what I said is true he was shocked that all that occurred theres much more that was wrongly done throughout the case. I will say if you think you cant afford an attorney, figure it out. The cost of not affording one will be far greater. Lessons we learn. Shew!",

    "title": "sexuality gender confusion, need advice :",
    "text": "Hi!! this might be a long and personal one so please only read if youre available to be kind and help me figure this out i will be posting this in the LGBTQ sub as well as the relationship advice sub i, L cis 19f have been dating my girlfriend M cis 19f for about a year and a half now. i have always had a decently high sex drive but have never actually done much with anyone other than myself, so i mostly rely on fantasies in my head. for the past few years i have had trouble identifying my sexuality, but after a while have mostly landed on bi / omni with a preference to females. thats only for romantic attraction though -- there are very very few people I actually had a desire to have sex with. when i did come across that someone, they were usually a male. ive been attracted to females often, but almost never have sexual attraction towards them. okay, jumping back to my current relationship. M has always been kind of shy when it comes to sex, we grew into talking about it together but when it was time to actually do things we often got nervous. I am diagnosed with autism, she isnt but after knowing her so well for so long while being autistic I am 99 sure she is also autistic. we both have lots of sensory issues, which makes it difficult to properly execute ideas we have in our minds about how things should play out e.g., skin on skin contact with sweat is sometimes uncomfortable for me. slowly but surely i convinced her to try some things out with me because i wanted to be freely intimate in our relationship. one night, one thing led to another and I ate her out and she came. i was VERY proud of myself considering id never eaten out anyone before and i wasnt expecting to actually do well. Now, the problem is, although I was taking full advantage of it in the moment because she was letting me try it out, it was very overstimulating for me. it was kind of itchy, the smell and taste were nauseating. and although I loved doing it for her so so much, every time shes mentioned it since, ive felt sick. i think its because genitals in general make me queasy, especially female genitals, which is where the gender stuff comes in. i am growing less and less comfortable in my own body. ive had fleeting thoughts before about wanting to be perceived more as a boy than a girl-- i dress very tomboyish and want to act like it as well. but I never work out, so my body is that of an average female. however, the idea of ACTUALLY being a boy is not appealing to me. for a few months, me and M have been roleplaying irl as fictional characters that we like shipping together shes V, i am A. when im with her its often difficult for me to be aroused when its just her not to say I never do, possibly due to her being a girl and having feminine features but primarily due to me not being who I feel comfortable being. but when we roleplay and I get into character as A, its so so quick and I feel so much more comfortable in my own skin and doing whatever I want. when Im with her and we are naked i often feel uncomfortable when she points out things like my body in general or my boobs or anything, even in a complimentary way. I dont want to have boobs when im with her I just want to be a flat chested genderless entity who can be whatever I feel like being. then i wouldnt be cursed with having this specific body and feeling feminine, nor be forced to be masculine. when i fantasize about me and M i usually envision us as A and V, i sometimes envision us as our real selves but most of the time its just so much more comfortable to not be myself in a sexual context. the reason i need help with this, is because that makes her kind of sad. M is always talking about how beautiful i am and how much she wants me, and i think its become clear after so much time that she isnt asexual, just demisexual. she gets off to just the thought of me sometimes which is so flattering, but i dont understand how she does it. i LOVE doing things with just me and her being ourselves, but its difficult for me to get turned on by a woman, even though its easier with her because shes beautiful and I love her. the other day she was really sad and something she said stuck with me. its like you dont want to be a lesbian with me. you just want to be boys. something along those lines but it really hit me hard. because even though I know were both girls, everything about it just feels so uncomfortable to me when Im forced to be in my own skin. shes still comfortable with rping and we both enjoy it a lot, but I can tell shes getting sad that I might not be attracted to her in the exact same way, whether it be for annoyance with my own self image or my compulsive heterosexuality. --- thank you so so much to anyone who reads this, any advice would be appreciated 3 i havent asked or told anyone other than her and myself about this yet. so thank you guys for hearing me out :",

    "text": "my girlfriend and I recently broke up because she told after a really bad argument while I was in the train station waiting to go back home that something had happen to her and she couldnt tell me! After about an hour of prying trying to get her to tell me she ends up saying that she went out a month prior a week before our 1 year and got blackout drunk and woke up in another dudes bed and said that she was rped! Now this devastated me because obviously, thats a wild thing to hear from someone you love especially romantically but I got to thinking of how this wasnt the first time this has happened to her nor the second, third or fourth this now has been the fifth time shes gotten drunk and gotten taken advantage of and it also is the reason her ex broke up with her so knowing all of that and knowing we also argued that night really bad too before she went out I just dont believe she didnt cheat on me intentionally I think she just feels guilty and just is doing the most to clear her name. She wont go to the police, she at first lied to me saying she didnt know who he is and it turns out she does! And I asked her to give me his info so I can confront him and she wont! Like I want to believe her I just cant Ive asked multiple people woman and men and they all say the same thing and dont believe her either its just very unfortunate situation and Im really disappointed and depressed from all this what do yall think? Shes also diagnosed with bpd so everyday was torture and a constant battle I know I shouldve left before but I love her so much you know its hard to just discard someone like that.",

    "text": "This guy 30M and I 30F talked for several months, weve known each other for years but just as acquaintances, and it got pretty serious pretty fast. Its still one of those things that I think we were made for each other but the timing was awful. He didnt treat me right, lots of things going on in his personal life so he called it off, even though he sent a picture of him and I to his mom, wanted me to meet his parents, and our values and morals align completely. Long story short, it didnt work out because he was afraid of distance since he tried long distance with his ex girlfriend, even though he knew I wasnt going to be in the same town as him after medical school. But why would he unlike my photos all of a sudden from years to months ago but continue to follow me? Why would he strategically remove his likes? Of course, you can see when someone is engaging with your profile on Instagram, so thats how I noticed they werent there, obviously because I still think about him. I know this is so childish, but want some advice on why someone would do this. He still follows me on my social media as well. Thank you.",

    "text": "Ive always loved weed. Its been medically and recreationally legal where I live for quite some time now. Ive smoked since I was about 18 years old. Im now 30. Over the last 5 years or so, my smoking has become so heavy. Those dang weed pens are so easy to hit WHENEVER you want. I used to love that I could smoke and relax and chill. Everyone always said it wasnt addictive and I was one of the biggest advocates of that. I could not agree with anything less now. The stuff the dispensaries are producing these days are SO STRONG. I began smoking all day, everyday. I dont think there has been a day I havent smoked in the last 5 years. It literally scared me if I had to go somewhere I couldnt smoke. Trying to quit is very uncomfortable. I dont even know how to explain the way I feel. Its like I dont see the world the same way anymore when Im sober. Like some sort of altered state of consciousness. Like Im here, but Im not. Im not hungry ever. I get weird cold sweats almost, but get hot very easily. Its almost like I can really feel the air on my skin more. I feel as if Im wired all day, with zero caffeine to be the cause. I cant remember things people tell me. Trying to fall asleep without it is literally impossible. Overall Im UNCOMFORTABLE. And as much as I hate this feeling. I think I hate the way I feel when I smoke now more. Other than the fact it takes away the physical part of being uncomfortable, each time I smoke my anxiety spikes and it just makes me feel awful. And depressed. And just unhappy. Like my brain is rotting no away in some stoned delirium. I feel like Im so stuck. I hate how I feel when I smoke, but I feel dreadful without it. Any advice to make this process a little more comfortable? Or speed it up? Is there anything that worked for you? Im desperate to stop. I just want to feel like myself again. I dont even remember who she is anymore.",

    "text": "So long story short I know its kinds wrong but me and my sister have been intimate for a few months now and have been doing it every other day when our parents are not home, but that isnt all. I also have kidney stones which I havent mentioned to anyone as I am too embarrassed, and while we were doing it I told her I needed to pee but she told me to keep going. So she leg locked me and forced me to cum inside of her, however I wasnt near finishing so I instead peed in her. So that leads me to my kidney stones going inside of her and scratching her vagina as she yelled out in pain I made up the excuse that it was nothing and she was tripping. So as the pee and kidney stones exited her vagina I quickly collected them and chucked them in the bin. Do I confess this to her or keep it a secret?",

How the hell have i burned through half of college and ALL of high school without making a single fucking friend? How is that even possible? Especially when considering that Im inherently a very social person with a litany of hobbies. I dress myself nicely, I take care of my appearance, I just literally cant find friends, the whole phenomenon of meeting people by coincidence just doesnt seem to extend to me. Typically youd think that youd luck your way into at least a couple of relationships? I get that you also have to put effort in, but I try, earnestly, I really really do. As I mentioned earlier Im a very social person, and honestly the last couple of years have been terribly draining",

    "text": "Location: Illinois So, me and my ex were making out, once we stopped she had turned the other way I guess she tried to sleep and I had unbuttoned her jeans, unhooked her bra but then nothing sexual happened all the clothes were still on, every layer. We just then slept for sometime after a few moments when our sleep broke we starting kissing and hugging again. I said I opened them so that she could relax and sleep. She only said that if you dont want to do anything then dont unhook the bra, I dont need it open for relaxation. After that we talked, hugged and kissed for sometime after which she rolled over and we were going to hump. I then unbuttoned one of her shirt buttons, I realized what I was doing and tried to put the button back. But then she freaked out of what was happening, then she went away and said what I was doing and told me to get away as well and then I came back to my place. we have broken up now In the past gone to 2nd base going to 2nd base was normal, seen her top half naked once before and made out and used my hands/thigh waist below with clothes on. While doing the deed she would feel nice about it but after the deed was done she wouldnt be feeling so nice about it. Now, later on she told me that she was asleep or in the state of sleep when I unbuttoned her jeans. I didnt know she was in the state of sleep as she had turned the other way. But she is telling me that I tried to take advantage of her in her sleep which I wouldnt, I have slept next to her before and never done anything like that and do something bad with her. She think I would has assaulted or harassed her. Does this make an assaulter or harasser? I wouldnt want to do anything like that to her, I understand that I didnt communicate, it is the key and that I definitely made a mistake. I am scared that if she goes to the Title IX they will think that I was up to something",

    "text": "My boyfriend 32m and I 26F have been dating for a little over 8 years now. Weve been through a LOT of things and Im just kind of over it. I havent seen a future with him for awhile now and Ive told him how I felt. Ive been VERY clear about my feelings towards him and how I very much dislike him as a person and dont want him in my life. The thing is he doesnt care. He refuses to leave. Ive been trying for A YEAR to get him to leave and dont know what to do. He lives with my family because we rent a pretty expensive house and he pays a decent chunk of the rent. Ive expressed my feelings towards my mom and she doesnt really care about the situation. I dont know how to make him leaveI have nowhere to go hide from him. No family or friends. I dont know what to do or where to go has any else ever dealt with a situation like this before? If so how did you manage to get out of it? I dont make a lot of money myself and where I live just renting a single room is almost 1500 and I cant afford that right now",

    "text": "I, 17F, turn 18 in just over 5 months and Ive been planning to move out since forever. The problem is, I live in a somewhat popular tourist destination, an amazing place to visit, sure, but a horrible place to live as a local. Living prices keep rising and as much as I love my home, I see no possible future for myself here in this country or even with my family as bad as that sounds. Getting a scholarship was my one shot out of here, but after an incident that happened a few months ago not something I feel comfortable discussing on here, I completely just shut down. I cant even being to explain you what happened during those few months. I felt so disconnected with my body, a visitor in my own skin just watching the weeks pass by. I stopped eating, sleeping for days straight, stopped replying to messages and it feels as though Ive lost all my friends. My mother scheduled an appointment with my guidance officer at my scholar and the decision was made to just unenroll from school completely to save my academic record in case I ever decide to go back. I hardly even remember any of it if Im being honest, theres been constant gaps in my memory during that period. Now the problem, is that my chances of getting a scholarship? gone. and now that Im somewhat slowly getting out of that haze I was in, Im realizing how truely fcked I am. Getting a job with the intent for saving to move abroad in my country is next to impossible. Minimum wage in my currency which is the onlyb thing I qualify for since Im technically still a minor equits to around 2USD. I make 2USD AN HOUR! at this rate saving is impossible and I cant depend on my parents for any help since I live in a household of 11 people, excluding myself, so its save to say Im on my own here. I dont know what to do anymore. I just hate everything. I hat myself, I hate the circumstances Im in, and tjose that lead me here. Im just at a complete lost, but one thing I know fir certain is that I cannot stay here. I will do whatever it takes to get out of here, I just dont know how yet. Im open to any and all advice. If youve even made it this far, I thank you for listening.",

    "title": "Mortgage Lender Requesting More Documents After Close",
    "text": "My fiance and I are first time homebuyers. We closed on our house on May 7. Yesterday, the mortgage company called me to tell me that USDA needs my bank statements because we used my checking account to wire the closing funds instead of my fiancés. Apparently, they only verified my fiancés bank info and not mine during underwriting. I sent my statements, and the mortgage lender is now hounding me for my Dads personal financial statements since he sent me some money back in February and March to help cover some student loan bills. I do not want to provide this info to them unless it is absolutely necessary. I find this to be extremely excessive and they are using language to suggest that USDA could pull our loan from us. I find this highly unlikely, since the loan is already closed, funded, and we have the deed to the property. But I also am unsure because I am a first time homebuyers. How likely is it that they are telling the truth by saying that our loan can be pulled from us? From my research, it appears to me that they are likely asking for these documents to cover up for the fact that they didnt verify my bank info, and they are trying to make sure that the loan can get USDA guaranteed and satisfy the investor that is purchasing my mortgage from them. The lender specifically mentioned USDA guarantee and the investor when I asked them why I needed to submit these documents. We had several problems with this lender before closing on the home as well. They sent us an incorrect closing disclosure a few days before we closed with an incorrect closing figure, and then sent us a corrected closing disclosure with the amount that we needed to bring to closing 1.5 HOURS BEFORE WE CLOSED. I think it is excessive for them to ask for third party financial information for someone who has no connection to the loan. I do not want to provide the information unless it is absolutely necessary. Will I be harmed in any way if I just ignore them?",

I had life happen and a ton of expenses came out of nowhere which has thrown a wrench in my debt repayment plan. I have a balance transfer card with more than 1 balance transfer. The higher balance is set to increase to the regular rate soon. My question is: do banks allow you to transfer those higher rate balances before paying off the lower rate balance? If so, how do I go about doing it? I have another card that I can extend it from 4 months to 15 months at the low balance transfer rate, which is what I need to maintain the rest of my already slim budget. After this cycle it should all be completely paid off.",

    "text": "Im 16, soon turning 17, and Ive never started the first page of a book and read the last page. It doesnt matter if its fiction or non-fiction, Ive never done it. Ive tried many, many times, but Im never able to. The closest Ive gotten for fiction is A Game of Thrones I got a hundred or so pages through, maybe 150. And for non-fiction, its Orthodox Dogmatic Theology by Fr. Michael Pomazansky, and I got 200 something pages in. Its a miracle I got that far into those books. For Dogmatic Theology, it took me 3 months to get that far, and A Game of Thrones was much simpler since Ive already watched the show, so I know everything that happens in the first book. Anytime I try and pick up a book, I just feel helpless. I cant understand the language and descriptions theyre using. Its so flowery and I just feel too dumb for them. I reread every sentence five times and it slows down the pacing to the point its frustrating and boring. I forget whats happening since Im too busy focusing on what The debauched undersides of the captains old wrinkles that grew too thick for his own skin meant. I made that sentence up, but you get what I mean. I just feel sad because I do want to read, but I never find anything that interests me. When I do, it takes me months to just get to page 100, and then Ive put so much effort then already, I give up and never finish it. I feel like a failure when it comes reading. I want to be the kind of person that does, but Im not and I hate it. Right now, Im reading 20th Century Boys, a manga my brother recommended me. Its 20 something volumes and Im really liking it. Im reading it super quickly and Im halfway through in a little over a week. I think thats really good. It is for me at least. If anyone has any advice on how I can start reading, Id appreciate it. Thank you.",

    "text": "Im trying to figure out what I should be doing with my life and would really appreciate an outside perspective. Im 30 and living at home in Canada with my parents, and I dont currently plan on moving out. I work as an Educational Assistant EA at a school, earning about 3,300 a month with no personal bills, so Im able to save around 2,500 monthlymainly for retirement, since I feel very anxious about the future had a unstable childhood. Im thinking about going back to school to get my degree and then attend teachers college, since becoming a teacher would offer a higher income and more long-term stability. My dad is planning to retire in about two years and will have a pension of around 4,000/month. After bills, hell have about 2,500 left, and even though he says he wont need help, I expect Ill contribute 5001,000/month to support them. Im also aware that inflation could make this more difficult. Eventually, Ill inherit their home, which is worth around 1.2 million, and my mom says I dont need to worry too much about money because of that and my savings. Still, Im worried that I may not be able to keep the house in the long run, and I dont want my parents or my quality of life to suffer. Ive also dealt with some grief in recent years, and one reason I like my current job is that its relatively low stressI dont have to bring work home or plan lessons. Im concerned that becoming a teacher, while financially beneficial, would involve a much heavier workload and I might end up feeling overwhelmed. Right now, I enjoy my job and the work-life balance it offers, so Im torn between staying in a role I like or pushing myself toward something more demanding for long-term gain. Do I need to worry about money, or does my situation seem stable enough? This is so long but thank you for reading",

He and my mom recently separated and among the other issues, I know there was an intimacy issue mostly it died on his side - thats the gist of what I got from my mom, so it was definitely not what I was expecting to see. I still live on our family farm with him and dont want to say anything for obvious reasons. I usually tell my mom everything, but obviously do not want to tell her this. I usually talk things out with her I have a bad habit of what I call squirrel cageing- basically going through things in my head over and over. It comes from anxiety and talking it out helps me process, and I need some advice for getting this out of my head. I know its a normal human thing, its just messing with me because he is my dad and I wish I hadnt seen it. I really dont want to let this affect how I see him.",

    "title": "My 27f girlfriend 26f treats me badly almost every day?",
    "text": "She will probably see this because she goes through my stuff all the time and/or has access to my accounts or follows me idk, not the point. Me and my gf have been together for nearly 2.5 year, in the beginning i was so happy and so grateful for her to be my gf, esp coming out of a 4 year relationship that was seemingly the most toxic relationship id ever been in. For context, we met online hinge and initially hit it off really well, and per usual, we moved in pretty quick too this is where the down fall starts, why you may ask... well. She told me a few months into dating have a blast at this point btw that she would be quitting her job and moving out of state to live with her mom. the reason for the move was really a job thing, she was very unhappy and felt like her job wasnt giving her the credit for the time she was with them very valid, so i encourage her to quit and try and find new employment, but of course in the limbo stage she wanted to move in with her mom also valid. SOOO, since i really liked her and wanted to keep things progressing and also knowing myself, the move would be a deal breaker for me. I told her that, she suggested with try long distance, i told her wouldnt work cuz we barely know each other and still so new, and realistically... we both would just move on after a few months most likely. But it came off to me as a temporary move that was still up in the air, so i suggested she just say with me at my moms house I still lived at home, why, cuz after my break up with my last partner i decided I wanted to become a Dr lol so i went back to school and started on the journey lol, also all of this was communicated as well to her when we first started to date. That basically, hey Im doing this thing x,y,z ie. med school / health realsted field esk thing that will take a long time, and ik Im already 25 at the time but Im kinda starting over, so ill be pretty much broke, and just focusing on school hense why i live with my mom still, blah blah blah but i want to note: THIS WAS COMMUNICATED !! i was excising my new found therapy sessions on this girl after my break up so i was setting hard boundaries, communicating way too much even, but i felt like i needed to cuz of my past where things just NEVER got talked about... anyways. So, i propose this idea, she says yes, and we move in together, initially i was great, only thing is she refused to leave the room for like.... a year. so my mom barely met her, she would just come in and out through the side door connected to my room, i would cook for her, clean, get her water, the whole thing. YES I KNOW THIS IS BATTY !!! but i was in LOVE! ... my mom was obviously very concerned but i was told it was bc she was anxious and nervous... over the year she eventually get more comfy and would come out lol... we went on a family ish vacation at one point which she hated, didnt like spending time with my family at all, even tho they paid for the flights it was to Italy btw.. at this point things started to go south we would fight all the time, still do, and she would talk about moving out and getting our own place, etc. i told her Im still in undergrad dont have a job so idk how thats possible, at this point she gets a good job and is making good money but doesnt pay rent. we have a few blow out fights, one happening nearly a few months before the CA fires, which i thought was the end. I ended up texting a friend for advice and she gave me some very generic advice basically to let her leave and that i deserve better pretty run of the mill standard any person would say, well she found the text and lost her mind. ended up smoothing it over, blah blah. well then the fires happen, we live very close, long story short i get an opportunity to move in to my old grannies house for free basically, and it would be my own spot while i goto school and graduate school, of course my gf comes along, i wanted to expedite this bc all i heard was how much she wanted her own space... well my rational brain says hey this seems like a solution! well we move in and almost or actually immediately, she starts to complain, she hates it here, it takes she too long to get to work which yes it does about an 1.5hrs there and back she moves near the coast and we live near the mountains so but, i can afford to move and also... she had been making that drive for a year prior which some issue. she would bring up moving here and there, but now its every... single... week.. she is driving to work only 3 days a week btw its like clock work, she calls on her drive back, and Im holding my breath waiting in anticipation to try and deflect it. WELP fast forward to today! Hi ! also i take the MCAT tomorrow ! she calls me... guess what... bitching about the drive and wanting to move. i cut her off, she hangs up. now this leads me to exhibit B. she does not care about me aspirations AT ALL!!! she never inquires about me, my day, my studies, nothing... she only bitches about it. how i never have time for her, Im always ignoring her, blah blah blah.. which i dont btw i do so much for this girl, Im just broke asf. so a couple of months ago we nearly broke up, she told me i need to be more of an adult and get a job, so i do, i get a full time job at a hospital actually, welp full time 40 hours right. hahahah she doesnt like that either!! SHOCKER ! i work too much now, i have to work on weekend some times, she hates that... dude. what. you told me to get a job to save up for moving out !!!!! ugh. to top all this off... she talks to me so poorly, i mean, the worst Ive ever been talked to in my life by someone, and my ex, was a nightmare.... she would yell at me so badly and so how this is worse. my gf will say under her breath how much she hates me, that Im a loser, that i should kmS... like just horrid things. i want to end it, but of course i have issues and its hard, i love her but man this is a horrible time rn. I wish she would just love me like a normal person.",

He called me in advance and told me he was going to go get it from her and wanted to let me know that he was meeting up with someone that was a girl and hes a guy and I said it was fine so he goes to get it in there at this like fast food restaurant. And then he ends up getting it and is walking back. He calls me and tells me how she is the dominant type, and Goes on about how shes a hoe. She messes with both girls and guys and he was planning on hanging out with her on the weekend and if she tried to kiss him he wouldnt be able to stop her, especially if she grabbed his face and Said that if he starts being very vague about her to make sure hes not doing anything stupid like thinking about cheating I really wanna break up with him but Im scared that Im being overreactive like maybe its just a cool girl that hes friends with but I dont know I overthink a lot so help.",

    "text": "My girlfriend 23F and I 24M recently decided to open up our relationship. We have been together for 5 years, we have two daughters, ages 3 and 1, and our sex life has become a bit routine. Lately, her sex drive has been lowshe gets tired more quickly during sex, feels insecure about her appearance, and is under a lot of stress due to our business. Weve talked about the idea of being in an open relationship several times since we got together, but we never acted on it until now. My sex drive is really high at the moment, and she just isnt able to meet those needs. After a lot of open, respectful conversation, she told me she understands where Im coming from and doesnt mind if I seek sexual experiences outside our relationship. Then we started discussing something that resonated deeply with both of usthat butterfly feeling you get when youre starting something new with someone. We both know we cant recreate that exact feeling with each other anymore, and I think we both miss it. Once we acknowledged that, it felt like a huge weight was lifted off our shoulders. Last week, she mentioned that a guy at the gym was checking her out. She actually asked him out yesterday, and although he politely declined, I felt genuinely excited when she told me. I was happy for her, proud that she made a move, and honestly, I found it sexy. Is it normal to feel that way? On a related note, Id like to start dating again, but I dont have much of a social life. I dont go to the gym, I dont have many solo activities, and Im not interested in going to bars or using Tinder. What would you recommend I do to improve my chances of meeting someone? Also, what would you recommend we do to not fuck up our relationship with this? P.S. Ive had ChatGPT rework this text because it was inconsistent af.",

    "text": "Long story shortened, I fucked up and lost my job while already in a bad spot financial and currently in debt to my girlfriends dad and things blew up today after not paying rent again. He covered it but he is rightfully pissed and I acknowledge that its my fault fully but I feel like I just lost everything. I lost my love, the respect of her father, my cats. I feel so numb and destroyed I cant process anything it just feels surreal. And the worse part about it is tomorrow I could be financially set for life, because of some investments in a family business thats taken longer to take off then expected. I have told my girlfriend and her dad about our business and unfortunately things never hit at the expected times multiple times over in the last 2 years so they dont trust in it taking off and I dont blame them. Im hopeful I can pay them back tomorrow but I cant say for 100 sure, and it just sucks. I just feel like the worse person and partner because this stress has been affecting her sleep and studies, and shes been scared to call her dad out of fear of him being mad at her and I just hate that im responsible and I cant do anything to fix it. She didnt have a great relationship with her dad when we first met and it was a huge thing for me to see her repair her relationship with him over the years and its made me happy too see it happen and the fact that Im reverting that due to financial troubles is killing me. I accept the reality and I just hope I can fix it in the coming days. Is it even fixable if she wants me to start packing my stuff. I feel like the only thing to do is breakup and stop being a tumor to her family.",

Took maybe 3540 minutes to set up. By the evening, I had 290 sitting in my wallet. No trading, no confusing steps just followed his post: CringeyCrab Money hit instantly, and I went on with my day.
