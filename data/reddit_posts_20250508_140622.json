    "title": "Roth IRA thru NWM? Scam or no Big Deal?",
    "text": "When I was just graduating college I got roped into some investments through Northwestern Mutual. They sold me on whole life and also set up a Roth IRA thru them. I realized over time that the whole life was a scam and got rid of that but Ive still been contributing to the Roth. Its got about 55k in it today. Its kind of out of sight out of mind. I max out contributions now and just forget about it they auto invest the money. Ive considered several times transferring to a different brokerage but dont really know how and dont want the hassle of the sales pitch from my rep at NWM. My question is is their Roth also a scam or is it fine to keep? And secondly how do I transfer to another brokerage if it is in fact a scam?",

He confided in her that he has to kill himself tonight because he betrayed his faith not sure if Im using the right words. English isnt my 1st language. He got drunk an got persuaded to sleep with a girl before marriage. Now, because he is muslim, he is feeling incredibly guilty and like his life has ended. He is scared and says he cant talk to anyone there because everyone is muslim aswell and they will all find him a disgrace. I cant help him from all the way over here and I dont have any sufficient knowledge about his faith and the shame that is connected to this. Does anyone know an organisation he can contact or something like that? Anyone or thing that can help him and guide him through this? I think he speaks Arabic and a bit of English.",

    "text": "Location Indiana My mom has had issues with their crappy neighbors over the years. From the wife trying to get weird attention from my moms husband to my mom having to tell them to stop letting their young kids play in their unfenced front yard unattended Im talking kids 4 and under with absolutely no supervision and their dogs are constantly provoking my moms dog Ill call him Scooby. So here it is, neither parties dogs can get along so my mom never lets Scooby out when the neighbors dogs are out. Sometimes it happens anyways because they like to leave their dogs out all day and Scooby eventually needs to be able to go to the bathroom. Step dad was home a week ago and without checking for the neighbors dogs he let Scooby out. Their dogs have dug a hole under their fence and one of the dogs stuck his head under it and started barking at my moms dog in her backyard. Scooby attacked the dog that stuck its head under the fence and it had to go to the vet to get checked out. The neighbors mom was watching the kidshouse that day and absolutely berated my stepdad and said what if that was my grandchild that Scooby attacked!? My stepdad looked at her and said why would you let a 3 year old put their head under a fence. She went ballistic and said she was calling the cops. They did show up but never went over to talk to my stepdad. A week later now and the neighbors put a vet bill in my moms mailbox with a note asking what they mom and stepdad would like to do about settling the bill. Do they even have a leg to stand on since their dog technically went onto my moms property when sticking its head under the fence? Should my mom ignore the letter or respond to it by telling her to kindly eff off? Would it be better to contact a lawyer to get them to realize they arent paying for anything?",

    "text": "Location Spokane, WA Employer Post Falls, ID My husband was out on disability due to a shoulder surgery for 3 months. He applied for Paid FMLA through the state WA as well as STD benefits through his employer since the state only pays 90 and we figured his employer would pick up the 10. I guess it wasnt communicated clearly so for two pay periods, his company ended up paying 60 of his wages. About a month later, they said they received a notice from the state that he was being paid FMLA benefits so he no longer qualifies for STD benefits and that he will need to pay back those STD wages paid to him. We understood. Today, he got his first paystub from being back to work and realized they took his ENTIRE paycheck. We thought maybe they would take a portion until the balance was paid back, but not the whole thing. So my question, is this even legal?! Im not sure how we are supposed to live or pay our bills if his employer is taking his entire paychecks until its paid off. They are also taxing it twice. They taxed it when he was first originally paid, and then he was taxed again on this paycheck and took the amount post tax. Please help! Idk what to do. We are already behind on all of our bills since he had to wait two weeks to even get this paycheck that he isnt receiving.",

I was pregnant not with his baby and we were both going through a rough time with recovery, so needless to say, things were rough. Weve stayed connected the whole time though and have never lost our chemistry throughout everything. Its been just a mutually exclusive physical best friendship since the break up. Were both in a much better place now and are ready to make a change. Weve even discussed being a family. Were going out on our first real date this Saturday. Hes very traditional and I know hes going to ask me to be his girlfriend again lol. I am trying to think of something cutefunny to say back instead of just yes because its been so long that weve been doing whatever we were doing and we both are very silly people. What should my response be?",

Or why I dont do the things I know I want and need to do. I understand depression can cause a lack of motivation but I dont wanna put it all on the fact that Im alone a lot and depressed. I wanna do the right things and idk if its a lack of motivation or what. Maybe its fear of commitment I seriously dont know or understand it. Most things in my life has been failure after failure and Im now wondering if that is playing a role in my stubbornness idk. Anyone else understand or relate to this at all?",

I used it abroad but did not rack up a very high balance, one that I could have paid off myself entirely but my parents graciously offered to pay. Well then they went 20k into debt. Maxed out that card. And the entire time I was an authorized user. I had no clue ab this debt or that my name was still on the card I was also only a sophomore in college, which I know isnt a great excuse, but it just really wasnt on my radar. I have a job now, have no debt of my own, and applied today for my first credit card. Immediately I was denied. I looked into it and its because I have a terrible credit history due to being an AU on this card. What can I do? When can I apply for a credit card again? Im really freaked out.",

My parents are divorced and my moms boyfriend was quick to swoop in and be a living father figure in the household and also a living man towards my mom. Fast forward 11 years I am now 20 and married with a daughter. The other day I was casually answering my friends on Snapchat when my moms boyfriend sent me a snap. Its not unusual for us to snap because I have most family members including my mom on snap. I opened it and it was a shirtless picture with a sentence accross the screen saying abs are coming in nicely He regularly works out and Im not sure if this was meant as just a workout picture or what but now I feel uncomfortable when I am around him and dont know what to think. I have yet to tell my husband because I dont know if I am overreacting or not to the situation or if there is even a situation to begin with. Do I tell my mom? Do I talk to my moms boyfriend about it? What do i do?",

    "title": "I struggle to believe in my religion, and my mom shames me for it yet shes never been in my place just a rant tho lol",
    "text": "Hey Im a 16 year old girl and Im Muslim. Some background is that my moms family is catholic and my dads is islam. my mom converted when i was 10 or so on my dads side though my grandma married a catholic, and my uncle married a Christian too. So my house is full of religion lol. But as you can tell Ive been exposed to both religions growing up, i would maybe go to church with my grandpa, and i would go to a mosque for weddings, celebrate Christmas, Eid, Easter, all that. Up until i was about 10 I had the bare understanding of islam because we werent a muslim orientated house, and i didnt understand a lot because my parents werent the type to do all that stuff iykwim. But i took it upon myself to pray every night with my grandma, and try to believe in allah more. I did go to a madrasah when i was younger, only for a few lessons till my parents took me out, im not sure why though but that was the last time i went to madrasah. So basically my understanding was still very little at that age, but i would still make an effort to pray every night with my grandma, because my parents didnt. Eventually around that time i noticed my dad would pray too. A year or so later covid happened and i think that was when i got my first phone and i would talk to people online. And i also did drift a bit from Allah too. I would still try to pray everynight to him about my problems, because around grade 6 i became very closed off, and not in the best mental state even though it maybe wouldnt show around my family and friends when i was left alone i would drown in my thoughts. My mom and Is relationship wasnt the best either for a few years after covid. I would often mention her in my prayers. And just hope someone anyone would answer to help me to feel like myself again. Around grade 6-7 i just lost faith and belief. I would occasionally pray still having a glimpse hope, and being scared of what was really after death. I eventually would stop and only pray when i was desperate for anything. Which is so bad and this couldve been avoided if i had someone to guide me in the right way. I was basically atheist for those years up until grade 8. And i would celebrate eid but i wouldnt feel connected to anything we did. I would deny putting on a hijab for ramadan in grade 6-7 because I just hated it. And in grade 8 i finally wore it. There was an incident where my friend took it off and was running outside the class with it which really put me off of it. Everyone thought i brushed it off and i never told my family. But it is a very disturbing thing. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed of my own religion. Grade 9 i didnt wear a hijab for ramadan. Im pretty sure grade 9 and 7 were the worst years for me. Ive never been more miserable during those years. I had the worst friends, and my religion just added to it in grade 9. That was when i realised something was wrong and i just genuinely lost belief in allah. I stopped praying and i struggled for a while trying to figure out why i was like this, seeing girls my age taking pride in this religion, wearing their hijabs, knowing the quran. And i couldnt even wear a scarf. It really got to me during the end of that year. That was around the first time i was invited to youth with my friends. I asked to go and my mom said yes. I mostly wanted to spend time with them, but at the same time i wanted to figure out if there was anything i could believe in. I went to youth maybe 3 or 4 times. But recently 2025 i asked and my mom said no. Her reasoning being how disrespectful i was during ramadan, which i understand because i was definitely ashamed of wearing a hijab. I usually cry when i think about religion too much and that really got to me. It felt like i was being called a bad muslim but, im a struggling muslim. But Ive been trying to practice islam i gave up because ive never felt a glimpse of hope that my prayers were answered. The only reason i still want to be religious is because i fear whats after death and i dont know what to believe everything feels so..I dont even know. When i read up on religions some of it adds up. But i always wonder if people just made this stuff up to keep humans from going insane and to have a mind at ease from death knowing we didnt know what was ACTUALLY after death?? I dont think ill ever be religious because i dont see things the way my family does and its so frustrating when they make me feel like a bad muslim when i have tried to believe in allah and everything for years but it feels like he doesnt answer and i dont see the point in it all. Im really trying to get better and it feels like its all a test or a phase. And i hope it is i dont want to feel so fragile and confused about everything forever. I just want my mind to be at peace without all these thoughts and prayers and doubts and beliefs Im really just looking for somewhat help or support from this post? Or maybe people like me. Idk it feels like Im the only person who feels and thinks this deeply. Thanks for reading thought if you do lol",

    "text": "Hi, so, sorry this is probably long. Anyways I got a new job, and Im trying REALLY hard to be a good newbie. And newbie mistakes aside, I just think I might not be good at socializing period. Context I was finding prescriptions to fill pharm tech and as I neared the end of the aisle, I overheard a conversation as follows A - ... so what do you think? Of her? B - I dont know, I think shes a sweet, nice girl. Just misunderstood I knew they were talking about me. The conversation started with ...supports g3noc!de and I was immediately stunned. I thought that was so random. Then I remembered, in a rush for lunch I had like 10 minutes before i needed to clock back in the previous day I drove to a Safeway in hopes of grabbing a cold sandwich. Instead, I sought refuge in a Starbucks to the entrance. In complete hunger, and under a time constraint, I didnt remember the protest. With two bites of my tiny Starbucks sandwich and after guzzling my drink, I threw it away in the breakroom trash. So I knew they were talking about me. And it hurt to be unable to defend myself since, reminder, Im eavesdropping. I think it may be because of my Starbucks cup in the breakroom trash can, but misunderstood? I know Im overly nice and not very personable, but it isnt intentional. Im just the not fun neurodivergent. I cant tell when people dont like me or are upset with me unless theyre yelling at me. I forget to join in the conversation so I come off as creepy i think and when I dont, I speak too much or -apparently- abnormally in conversation. I dont know what to do. Obviously you cant tell me what to fix if you never meet me, but I just would like some hope that Im not a lost cause. I dont want to be unlikeable. I kind of just over-niceness-ify myself in lieu of social etiquette and normalness. How do I be normal??? Rant over.",

We take 3 subjects, shes done 2 and has 2 more exams one in 2 weeks and another like 3 weeks after that. I dont constantly talk about feeling sad or anything upsetting me, but I do occasionally need support and I cant get that from her. I speak to my friends about the other events in my life, but some of it is a bit related to her, I need reassurance sometimes and she cant give me that right now. I know itll be over in a month, but in the mean time how do i deal with that? The stuff relating her?",

    "text": "Location Rhode Island Posted yesterday about an issue regarding a new tenant and our landlord and have reached out to a lawyer irl but waiting for the return call for a consultation. New tenant set to move in June 1 and after a phone and email conversation with the landlord, was told he was in violation of the lease and the landlord would be rescinding the lease offer to him and that I needed to find a new roommate. He returned the guys deposit to me but the lease was still cosigned. Was informed yesterday that the lease would still be valid, so I took the post down. It got a little hairier today so double checking for my anxiety. We had a washer and dryer in our apartment that crapped out from age and were included in our lease. New tenant knew our washer had died and was being removed and set to be replaced when signing the lease. The landlord said he would replace the washer and dryer but would be putting them in the basement to connect to the lines and be labeled as for our apartment use only. New tenant got in touch with the landlord yesterday about the washer and dryer, now that were getting close to move in, and apparently told the landlord that the washer and dryer needed to be in the apartment and he would not have signed the lease if the washer is not in the apartment itself and would seek legal remedies if its placed in the basement. Landlord claimed that he was in violation of the lease as one of the articles is that he was aware of the condition of the apartment and agreed to it at signing. Now the landlord is insisting I find a new tenant as a roommate after he said he consulted his own attorney and that the guy cant move in. New guy is claiming hes moving in on June 1 unless a court order says otherwise. Im now in the middle of the situation, currently sitting on this guys security deposit as neither the new tenant or the landlord want to be in possession of it and the landlord is now telling me that if I dont provide him another tenant and this guy moves in, hes going to void our new lease starting on June 1 and evict the entire unit.",

    "text": "Ive been with my current girlfriend for 5 years off and on and I love her with everything I have in me, but I cant help but be apathetic to her needs. It takes so much effort just to think about anything abstract outside of my day to day goals and routine that I cant even think of her. I want nothing but to make her happy but the second it comes to putting in the work to help her or do some little romantic gesture I get anxious and shut down. Its gotten to the point shes begging me to get her flowers but I turn it into a fight and say hurtful things I dont mean. Then I run away and threaten to leave. Then once she confronts me with her pain I narcissistically make it about myself. We got together so young with so much unsealed childhood trauma and shes been here for me but not the other way around. It feels that shes become the man in the relationship and me like a little boy. Outside of the relationship im an athlete and blue collar guy with no anxiety or confidence issues but I cant help feeling like ill never be enough for her. When we get in the car I cant drive, when were walking I cant lead, when anything is needed of me I freeze under the pressure. And im not sure why because she desperately wants me to lead and believes in me and supports me despite everything. Someone please help me I want to man up and make this work for her.",

    "text": "Location Pittsburgh, PA I just get my second Interproximal Reduction IPR done today. My orthodontist wasnt here and I am leaving soon. So the doctor request other dentist to get my IRP done. I wasnt informed that other dentist will work on my teeth until I arrive the office. During the process, there were two people present for the entire process, the dentist and my orthodontists assistant. The dentist initially using sand paper to polish my teeth, however, he switched to disk drill to cut through my teeth. Instead of cutting vertically, the dentist cut diagonally through my teeth 3 teeth were damaged, and evetually leads to one of my teeth become extremely sore. The IPR procedure was extremely plainful and sore, however the dentist did not stop but rather keep damaging my other teeth. During the entire process, even after the process end, neither the dentist and assistant have informed me about the damage done to my teeth and sent me back home. After I went back home, I figure myself there was a miscomfort among my teeth and extreme pain when I was drinking water or biting down. I eventually went to see another dentist and took a x-ray for my teeth. Reference In this situation, what should I do, seeking an malpractice lawyer? If so, where I can find a trustwhorthy lawyer that can take my dental case. For a detailed post",
