    "text": "for context, we are both 18f, are about to graduate highschool, and are heading to the same college this fall. I was planning to dorm with her and we sent in the application months ago but now i have been having majorrrr second thoughts. this all started in october of 2024 when her and her bf of 4ish years broke up and it was very messy. after they break up and he starts throwing allegations that she was threatening to hurt herself if they broke up or not eat if he got instagram and all this other crazy stuff. I hear this and dont believe it cause shes my bestfriend and I trust her and am literally defending her to anyone I can at school. now, it is currently may of 2025 and she is still talking about how her ex is out to get her, serioiusly every chance she gets she talks about him and it is so draining to hear. anyway, the other day i am shown the text messages between her and the ex, which prove everything he said about her to be right. mind you, she was going on and on saying things like how would he lie about me like this , the whole school hates me and telling me that everything he was saying was a lie. but now finding out that she had been lying to my face the entire time, i am so upset. and i feel like i wouldnt be as mad if it was a petty thing but lying about something as serious as those topics really irritates me. also i probably looked like an entire idiot defending her to everyone else because they all knew she was lying at the time, and me being seen around with her probably also made me look bad aswell. so this along with other things that I wont include in this post, is why I am having second thoughts about dorming with her. Im afraid that i cant trust her anymore and that ill end up being miserable, but also she is still a good friend of mine who i love and i am genuinely terrified to confront her or make her mad at me for saying i no longer want to dorm with her. what should i do please help.",
