    "text": "Hi everyone. I recently posted on am I the a about a situation where both my friend and I applied for and received a competitive scholarship. Since applying, shes been upset with methough she hasnt said anything directly. Ive since learned from other friends that she feels I didnt need the scholarship as much as she did, and that I shouldnt have applied. Over the past semester, shes been increasingly cold and passive-aggressive toward me. She snaps at me in conversation, ignores me, makes plans in front of me without including me, and leaves class, lunch, or afterschool activities without waitingI always wait for her. Its only recently that I connected her behavior to the scholarship. Two friends have confirmed that shes frustrated with me over it. While Ive come to terms with the fact that I didnt do anything wrong by applying I have my own reasons, including uncovered educational costs and long-term opportunities, Im completely lost when it comes to how to handle the social fallout. This wasnt just one friendIve realized that my whole friend group, who I considered my closest friends, seems to have also believed that I was in the wrong for applying to the scholarship. Ive been gradually distancing myself the past two weeks, partly because of testing, but also because the atmosphere has become unbearable. Now, in my last week of high school, theyve fully stopped sitting with me at lunch. During lunch, they have sat away from meI know that at this point they are silently telling me to go somewhere else but I truly have no idea where else to go, they have been my closest friends these past years. I dont need closure from themIve accepted that this is a friendship breakup. But its incredibly painful to go through during whats supposed to be a joyful, celebratory week. I feel isolated, and I honestly dont know where else to go during lunch/class or how to keep my head up until graduation. If anyone has advice on how to get through this last week with some dignity and peace, Id really appreciate it. Thank you all for reading this far.",

I am 14 year old girl, usually talkative, outgoing, with an insane energy and personality. I have ADHD, and am prescribed adderall XR 30mgs. To be honest, it helps a LOT with school, or staying focused on things, but my personality is completely stripped when I take it. I am often too quiet in school, or sometimes the complete opposite. But people think that I am either just quiet or just energetic and crazy, when in reality I am both. Everybody says they love me, I get told that apparently nobody hates me, but it is never made clear. Why do people say they love me, but then use me as someone who doesnt have an opinion on anything? I have thoughts too! And I want to contribute but they never view me as someone who cares. How do I get them to understand me, and listen to what I have to say?",

    "text": "Today for instance Im in a hurry to get to placement I need to make a coffee Housemate only speaks Japanese and I speak a bit she barely understands any English Anyway she stands in the kitchen eating her breakfast making it so awkward and impossible for me to make my coffee quickly I have to run back and fourth from things trying not spill due to her wanting to stand in the kitchen. She watches me and gasps as I drop things not thinking maybe she could make some room for me and eat at any of the tables nearby she stands in the centre of the kitchen hogging the sink kettle and trash can eating her cereal and banana casually I dont have the mental energy to speak in Japanese nor the time to explain this so I sent her a message saying could she not do that in future I feel like a huge pain in the ass always correcting their behaviour often stuff like this happens but like is this a me problem or a them problem? The language barrier makes it impossible to get anything done quickly so I have to text them later I live with 3 Japanese girls and Im a busy medical student and work For instance I had an assignment due last night and I also installed the new electric door handle my bf did I kinda own the home but not really so I do all the maintenance Anyway I send a text saying please organise a time for me to setup your fingerprint also if u would like Instead of your just ur 4 digit pin So one comes out and says she wants to do her fingerprint right then and there I know she wont understand me so I have to oblige and drop everything and do it for her Its frustrating that I feel like I cant live normally eg do things when they suit me such as make a coffee without someone wanting to do something annoying like eat standing in the kitchen Am I the crazy one or are they annoying??",

I feel like Im falling out of love with my bf after we had an argument and he criticized my love language of gift giving and words of affirmation told me no matter what I do or how hard I try, he will never be more expressive. So basically, Ive receded and have been working on myself and spending less time speaking to him. He doesnt really seem to notice and has said he appreciates the space Ive been giving him. Which is cool but I feel isolated and if my needs arent being met. It hurt me because hes an avoidant and doesnt seem to put in as much effort as I have. I know hes going through financial trouble right now with a tight job so Ive been understanding but he seems to find money to spend on things like weed and nicotine patches. We have been LDR since meeting 8months ago and we are planning to see each other next week for a few days since its been 5 months since our last meet up we have a 4k mile gap between us. I dont know what to do. I feel sad that Im pulling away but its like no matter what I do, I cant seem to feel the way I used to about him. In my past 3 relationships, I started out as anxious but eventually ended them when I began distancing myself and became avoidant. I feel like its happening all over again. Has anyone had a similar situation and what was your outcome/what did you do to try and fix it?",

    "text": "I saw my friend of 6 years for the first time in over half a year, I am worried. Okay here is a little overview. Last year, my friend Im gonna call her E left school to do online school. She didnt really understand a lot of social concepts from what I saw, and she didnt get along well with the kids at school. After she left school, I didnt really see her that much. Recently E reached out to me saying Hey girl, I have been so lonely lately, I dont have any friends anymore. I havent seen anyone that isnt my sister, mom, or dad in 3 weeks. So, do you want to hangout sometime soon? Of course I said yes, I thought it would be good to catch up on life! But when we did hangout, I realized that she is so so out of touch with the world. She kept saying things like it is good to see you because I havent been outside in 2 weeks straight! And stuff about how she is actually like, cool now! because she wears Billie Eilish merch, and is OBSESSED with Billie Eilish oh my god. She said one time billie eilish changed her hair color, and E cried for days?!? I was genuinely concerned at the things I was hearing, because she thinks that this is all just normal?
