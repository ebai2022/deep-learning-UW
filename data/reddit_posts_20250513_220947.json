    "title": "What should I do here?",
    "text": "My boyfriend 30M and I 26F have been in a relationship for about 5months and I feel like most of our relationship is through our screens. We both work Mon-Fri, his job being physically demanding and mine being mentally, and we both have the weekends off. We live about 25mins away from each other. The reason I say our relationship is mostly through our screens is because I feel like we dont get to spend much time together. We go out once every week or two on a weeknight for about an hour before he has to leave because he needs to sleep early for work as he starts much earlier than I do. Ive suggested going out earlier so we could have more time but he just wants to unwind which I understand. A lot of the time during our weeknight dates he is super tired, falling asleep, not very energetic so I feel selfish for taking away his time to rest. Friday nights Saturday nights are for the boys as he says. They normally either go out to drink or drink at one of the guys houses. We have tried Sunday dates but hes normally too hungover so ends up cancelling and makes up for it during the week. Ive asked if we could do Saturdays during the day before he goes out with his friends, we tried it but hes hungover from Friday so same result. Ive asked if we could spend time together every second weekend or something and he agreed to it but so far hes been giving in to his friends just come out and come drink with us etc so that hasnt worked for us either. Ive mentioned to him that I feel like we rarely spend time together and when we do hes always tired so to me it feels like Ive forced him to come out and spend time with me. He said he is always grateful for the time we spend together and is happy whenever he gets to see me whether its 5mins or 5hrs. Now I feel like Im being ungrateful. I understand there are so many long distance couples that rarely get to see each other, so Im trying to see things from the glass half full perspectivebut I just cant help but feel sad that I get so little time with him and the time we do spend together always has a time limit because of work. Please share your thoughts. What should I do at this point? Is there some kind of middle ground/compromise we havent yet tried? Any suggestions to resolve this would be extremely helpful and appreciated.",

    "title": "Becoming okay with being weird?",
    "text": "The weird cousin, the oddball friend, the quirky girlfriend. Not super flattering titles. But unfortunately for me, very fitting. Ive never really been cool. The closest Ive gotten to it is when I lost a lot of weight, hit puberty late and got hot enough for guys to ignore my odd behavior. Me liking anime and video games was hot now instead of lame thank you, Ramona Flowers. I feel like as an adult being different is kind of more acceptable now. That being said, I still get treated not so kindly Im being myself. I try to hang out with family members who are more socially adjusted, or I try to expand my horizons with friends. MISERABLE. ABORT MISSION. It always goes so terribly. I always get this weird look after a while like they clocked me as a freak, or I just end up stuck talking for a really long time, saying something I thought was funny. Nobody laughs. Its genuinely the worst. Ive put in a lot of effort to try and change myself. Ive stopped watching the cartoons I liked, got rid of my pink hair, and tucked away my stuffed animal collection. Im blonde now and am even starting to watch Sex and The City... thats how badly I want to fit in. But its EXHAUSTING. I just dont feel like I relate to other womens interests at all. That can sound pick-me or like Im trashing other women, I dont give a crap. My interests dont appeal to most men either so I dont view this as me trying to shove myself into some palatable box. Ive already evaluated that scenario in my head. Lets be real I have yet to find a guy who wants to rewatch She-Ra and the Princesses of Power with me. If I do find him, Ill marry him if hes not gay. This isnt about judgment of other women, this is about feeling mismatched with about 98 of the population. I dont really know how to be comfortable with this. Everyone is so fucking judgmental all the fucking time. Why is it a problem if I want to do do arts and crafts instead of clubbing? I dont have an issue with what they like to do, so why am I judged? The worst part is, its everything I like. Theres an issue with the shows I watch, the games I play, the way I dress. Its everythinggggg. The best example is when I admit I like anime. Ill tuck away most of my identity and be considered alright, but then suddenly I mention an anime Im watching and Im automatically deemed a mega-gooner who hasnt showered in ten years. I dont even watch anything crazy. I watch innocent romance animes and a few action ones and no, no fan service in any of them. You just cant win. Other peoples discomfort has made me more and more uncomfortable with my existence as I grow older. I feel ashamed to even admit I like animal crossing these days which really shouldnt be embarrassing, its the cutest game ever. So, that brings me to my question. How do I become okay with being weird? How do I unlearn the shame others have projected onto me, and more importantly, how do I become okay with the fact that I dont mesh with most people? As I get older I would really like to be comfortable with myself and stop giving a crap if people think Im a loser. To be cringe is to be free, but how the hell do I stop cringing at myself? I hope this is all worded alright and someone understands what I mean. I dont even think Im that weird, Im just told I am constantly. Its late at night and I would really like to stop hating the unconventional parts of myself. Im tired of everyone telling me how absolutely unlovable and lame I am for liking things they dont. Thank you in advance :",

    "title": "he 21m doesnt want me 21f to bring our dogs camping.",
    "text": "Not sure if Im being too harsh or if theres a compromise here Im overlooking. My 21f boyfriend 21m have been together for 3 years and lived together for two of those years with my family. My boyfriend got a dog lets say Screw shortly after I met him, and we introduced Screw to my dog Goose pretty quickly. Now, the two dogs live together with us in my parents house they are very bonded. I recently planned a camping trip because Im halfway through my schooling, its finally summer, and I want to relax. Of course my partner was automatically included in my plans and so were our dogs. Initially, I thought we should only bring one dog, and my boyfriend agreed with that. But when I brought up how the dog left behind would feel, we agreed to bring both of them. I began planning and buying things with the intention of bringing the dogs. I have to admit, I have been pretty fixated on the idea of hanging out at the campfire and going on hikes with my puppies, because theyve never gone camping before. I even went to the vet and got special vaccinations for them, since wed be hiking and near water. I booked the trip last Friday yes, a little last minute. It is now Tuesday, and my boyfriend came home saying he doesnt want to bring the dogs after all. I feel blindsided and honestly hurt, though Im not sure how valid that feeling is. He told me he thought the trip would be just us which Im not quite sure where this came from, because the first thing I texted him regarding the trip was Wanna go camping with me, you, and Screw? And he said yes, that he wanted Screw to have fun. I have since said we can just bring one of the dogs, or bring a larger tent if the space is not enough. He says its not the space, its that the dogs would be a responsibility and that he just wants the trip to be us relaxing. I want to make memories with our dogs together in one of the few activities dogs can do. I just want to know if theres a solution between cancelling the trip because I do not want to go without the dogs or go on the trip with just my partner and missing/feeling bad for the dogs the entire time.",

    "title": "My husband doesnt care about my feelings.",
    "text": "Ive never posted to reddit before but I dont know where to go so that he wont find this. I just need an unbiased view and maybe some advice. My husband and I have just had an argument. One weve had a few times before but the outcome never changes. I thought about taking a different approach this time to see if it could yield a different result but alas, I have failed. Some info before I jump in. Weve been together 8 years, We have two children, I work for his fathers company part time doing payroll and invoicing and I run our household. He runs his own business. Its blue collar, hard labor, and he spends a lot of time working to provide a good life for our family. My issue is that im not allowed to feel sad and if i do, i cant talk to him about it because my problems are small and stupid and my life could be way worse so stfu and stop comlaining. I was diagnosed with depression around going into highschool. I deal with days where I just cant handle a lot mentally and need a little love and comfort and he cant understand why when i have a good life. Depression is funny like that, i dont have a reason for feeling like im worthless, i just do. I broke down a few years ago and told him how the voice in my head tells me Im stupid, Im worthless, I deserved the terrible parents and abuse I endured as a baby and i dont deserve the good things that come to me. Id never take myself out but some days I just pray someone else would. I think of it as a light switch I dont know is being flipped and Im gone and ill never know it. It brings me comfort somehow but I love my babies and I cant imagine putting them through something like that. As an example to his dismissal, I had a bad day a few months back and he was out at his weekly dart league with friends. I hadnt seen him all day and I was getting to a dark place mentally and reached out to him I had a bad day, x y and z happened, but its OK, the kids are fed, no one got hurt, and its water under the bridge, I just want to have a few drinks and throw some darts with you when you get home his response was idk what you want me to say. When he came home he was so angry with me, for ruining his time with his friends, for sending him too many texts complaing about trivial things that pail in comparison to the hard work and mental load of his days. I quote you his exact words youre allowed to have a bad day and not bitch about it, I dont complain to you about my days theyre a lot harder than yours. He thinks the things I complain about are irrelevant but im not comlaining that the kids are crying or theres a mess i have to clean up. He says that my life could be worse so suck it up, that because he doesnt need any sort of emotional comfort that I shouldnt either. I just have moments where I need a little extra love and its really not often, maybe a handful of times a year. Some kindness to help the voice in my head stop screaming Im worthless and I mean nothing. My husband is a very stern man, says he looks at life exactly as it is, a realist if you will but he also has a short fuse. I can trigger his anger and it will be over the SMALLEST things. Here recently its felt like at least once a week hes yelling at me over something that just blows my mind. Like how can THIS be such a big deal to you. Lately hes been complaining that I dont preform the ole sucky suck like I should. Because he deserves it with all the hard work he puts in for our family. Its basically a demand at this point and ive felt so disconnected from his lack of emotional support that its just another chore on my never ending list. Incase it matters, I take care of the household. besides when something breaks, he will fix it and the yard which i help with from time to time. Very nuclear, i dont mind it. His demand for blow jobs, his lack of emotional support, and the fact that every single argument weve ever had he has had to include my life is harder than yours so deal with it i can do what you do with no problem, you wouldnt last an hour in my shoes. Just makes me not want to even touch him sometimes. He is making me feel so small, like what I do for our family is replaceable, i feel like a maid. I feel like my mental health and my feelings do not matter to him. as long as I can pretend to be happy then everyone else can be happy for real. I told him tonight that I think Im lacking in providing for him sexually because hes lacking in providing for me emotionally and he absolutely refuses to understand why I feel that way. Its completely wrong for me to look to my partner for comfort and kindess when he doesnt ask for that in return. At one point I said ok I get it, youre first place struggle buss, my issues dont matter because they cant measure up to yours and he was like yes! Exactly that my point. Ive always been kind, loving, and supportive to him. I believe in him when he doubts himself. I listen to him when he wants to talk about something that went wrong during his day but when its my day where something went wrong? Doesnt matter, suck it up, your life could be worse. He will absolutely die on this hill. I love him, hes an amazing provider, so incredibly smart, and we have a lot of fun together. I love our family. Am I asking for too much? All I need is a hug, an I love you and, a sorry youre feeling this way, lets do something together but because he has it worse, I cant have it bad at all. Idk after typing it all out I just feel defeated. Like I truly dont deserve emotional support from my husband. Ive even asked him to just fake it. Just pretend comfort me and in your head you can think this is stupid all you want just dont say it out loud but he said he couldnt do it. I want to go to counseling or a therapist but I know hell refuse that too. I cant support myself and two kids if I were to leave him and ive moved away from my home state and back to his. I have no family and hardly any friends here. I just dont know how we move forward together.",
