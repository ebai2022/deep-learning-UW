    "text": "I will try to keep this short for all of us sake. 20 years old, never had a job. The only thing I do in my life is play video-games, go to the gym and go to college law. Ive recently notice that I cant push myself to do uncomfortable things. Even tho I know they are good for him and I should do them, my brain just shuts it down. Take for instance today: I planned a new workout routine, was going to do 3x fullbody. Never did that one before. I take my 15 minute walk to the gym under the sun, arrive there, go to the bathroom, smoke a bit of my vape and then just leave. Just like that. At the time I thought Well holy shit, I just came here, I need to do something but then my brain just said hey you will finish a 30 minute cardio on the way back home, thats good enough lets roll. Or even college, I just do the bare minimum. I still havent ready any books law related, even others but well get there or studied when it wasnt on the night before. I wake up at 12, have this pathetic excuse for a routine and then boom. This isnt sustainable man. When I finish college, my parents will cut the money they send me I live in the big city and they in the rural areas. I wont get a good paying job to sustain myself until then. Im on borrowed time and even so my brain doesnt do shit. Im a master procrastinator and a fucking failure. I live because of my hobbies instead of having them to make live better. I dont even dare saying this is a life. Please dont give plain advice like Build a routine or Focus. I want things that I can do to trick my brain into becoming productive. Even better if there are atual life stories like mine that youd like to share.",

    "text": "Hey guys, Im facing a pretty big choice in life rn . I 25m am not happy with my current life in the Midwest. Im a maintenance tech at a food processing factory working 55-65 hours a week. I do enjoy the work but heres the issue. Im a recovering alcoholic 6months sober no drivers license living with my gf 20 I met last year . Now last year she was very caring and is what I needed as an alcoholic with no support from family as they dont care for me much due to my past alcohol induced actions. Since recovering from daily alcohol use Ive lost 20 pounds gained a lot of muscle my dad is 100 Filipino with very lean muscular genes and feel great always trying to better myself. My gf on the other hand was already overweight when I met her but now shes pushing 190 at 54 and has been very controlling of my anything I do outside of the house probably fearing a relapse. Ive been very annoyed with her comments and constant hovering and have lost a lot of physical attraction to her the last 6 months. Ive tried to get her to come to the gym or even come walk with me while I play disc golf but she always tries to cut it short and when she doesnt shes constantly complaining about how she doesnt enjoy it and it takes too long. We dont have any other activities we enjoy together. She doesnt have any hobbies other than reading fiction books and doomscrolling TikTok. She works only 15 hours a week as she changed her work schedule to cater to me not having a drivers license since I make significantly more money. She wont even let me go into the gas station alone in fear Ill buy a shooter or something and drink again. I did love her before as she listens well and is nurturing but lately shes been very short with me and is always telling me shes hungry or needs this or needs that she doesnt cook, her cleaning of the home is subpar she doesnt even go to the laundry mat alone bc its too heavy and theres too many dirty clothes. Im getting sick of spending my 1 day off at the laundry mat with her folding clothes when she only works 2-3 days a week for 4-8 hours per shift. She wont even try to learn how to cook she says I dont know how I dont want to mess it up although Ive told her trial and error is learning. Recently after picking me up from work I wanted to play a round of disc golf only 9 holes probably 45min round. She said fine well go play bullshit disc golf since you always want to go. It really killed my mood since disc golf is my decompression time I really enjoy. I told her never mind just take us home. I do understand she is sacrificing her time to drive me around but it seems like shes starting to use that fact against me. I own a car and have considered driving myself unlicensed just to get away from her constant nagging. Anyway heres the predicament My cousin m25 in California is a successful solar salesmen. With my newfound sobriety hes offered to fly me out to live in his apartment with him and learn the ways of solar sales. Im considering just uprooting my life and going out there. I know shed never leave the Midwest as she doesnt possess very employable skills even though Ive offered to pay for online school she says I cant do school online. So Reddit should I do it and just leave Im thinking Ill leave her with around 6k cash to get by and just end things. I honestly dont think shell ever look at me as I am sober. Shell only remember the drunk idiot who loses his keys and wallet everyday. BTW I was never a mean nor violent alcoholic just very forgetful even with important things.",

    "title": "How do I decline when I friend suggest we invite other of our friends to our plan ?",
    "text": "TLDR: I have a very close friend, but usually when were planning activities or just meeting up she would often asks me whether I mind if she asked the others from our group of friend about 10 people, because we almost always hang out as a group anyway. Theres no ill will or anything, its just that our group dynamic has always been to do include the others... soo its often the assumption. I like everybody, theyre some of my closest friend too, but sometimes I actually would like for some quality time 1 on 1. How do I say no, that I would like to actually spend time with HER specifically ? Among my group of friends which Ive known for a very long time now, we always do stuff as a group because why not. And now that were all in the active parts of our life, whenever two people try to meet up it often ends up being a group thing because finding time to gather people if theyre available is hard. But theres this one friend, we ended up studying in the same city and as we hung out a lot more than we used to, our friendship grew way deeper. But now that were all getting busier in our late 20s, seeing her and everybody else is becoming harder. Like we keep texting, but the only times we see each other is when were doing stuff with our whole friend group, so I get why we keep doing . Again, its great, but Im actually seeking some quality 1 on 1 time with her specifically just like we used to. Yesterday she messaged me and asked me if I was down to get drinks at a bar, but I could already see it coming, she asked me Do you mind if I asked the others ?. Yeah sure, theyre my friends, of course I want to see them and since its just something basic like going at a bar or a restaurant, the more the merrier. ... but what if I said no for once ? How do I decline her proposition in a way that it doesnt sound unnatural and/or blunt ? She always asks me that out of politeness. I know that she wouldnt push the matter more if I said no, but its also the sort of question where you never expect the other person to actually say no unless there is a good, strong reason for that. And I dont have any, other than I actually like spending time 1 on 1 with you. Shes open-minded and understanding, but even then she would definitely find it odd that I answered no. Im kinda scared of doing that so I just keep saying yes. I could be honest and say I actually like when its just the two of us spending time together and shed get it, but Im too much of a wuss to say this out loud. It sounds weird. Theres this movie we talked about a while ago, and she asked me if Id be down to see it one day since its something we both would enjoy though the others could like it too. Its not like going for some drinks which is just a pretext so see everyone, here its something specific to us. Its been a while, we both completely forgot about the movie but there are still some screenings in some cinemas nearby. What if I asked her to go watch that movie, what should I say so that its just the two of us for once ? What do I answer if she, again, asked if we should invite the others ? Or should I be straightforward and honest instead about me liking when its just us two? Sorry for the huge blocks of text, it turned out to be very lengthy.",

    "text": "I met my boyfriend when I was in college almost 3 years ago while he was on vacation. We lost touch until he texted me a few months later that he had moved to my city and wanted to meet again. Over time I really grew to love him, and he treated me like I was practically a gift. He loved everything about me and wanted to spend forever with me. I have since graduated college and he followed me to a smaller city for work. I fear he does not love everything about me anymore. I was fun and young when we met and now I am going through the struggle bus a little with the transition into adult life after college. I dont think I have changed much, more like his perception of me shifted. I put on a few pounds as im sitting at a desk all day Im still fit and attractive IMHO. I have a stressful job that I want to leave to go work at my families business. We have a crappy apartment because I wanted to save money. We dont have friends here. Long story short things arent as glamorous as they were when I was in college and had all that extra time to workout 2x a day, mentally recharge, cook and clean for him every day, and live almost stress free with an active social life. Im just trying to figure it out and thats going to take some time. However I can pick up his annoyance with me. He complains to me about his job all day, if I bring up one thing he rolls his eyes. I occasionally smoke weed after work nothing new and suddenly he is very bothered by this had to press to get him to admit that and wont talk to me. He is annoyed I only leave the house to go to the gym and groceries or shopping where does he want me to go?? so he doesnt have alone time. However he has an office and if he closes the door, I never go inside. A lot of things he isnt saying verbally however I can sense he wants me to suddenly have everything figured out and be 100 solid and be this person that does it all with no reservations. When I try to plan the future and set up a plan for us and brainstorm, to fix the situation, he is now quiet and doesnt contribute his thoughts. Is my relationship toast?",

    "title": "how can i 23F fix my relationship with my avoidant boyfriend 26M?",
    "text": "I want to start by saying my boyfriend is genuinely one of the loveliest, smartest, most thoughtful people i have ever met. We have been dating for about 14 months and are currently on a break. i would also like to say i posted about this somewhere else but only included info about the most recent issue and had different questions. sorry if this is long. a few months into our relationship i was spending a significant amount of time at his place he lives alone. up until this point we didnt have any issues, he was very attentive and supportive. One day i was just in a bit of a bad mood and requested some reassurance/love. Its like a switch flipped in him, he was suddenly cold and monotone. Id not seen him like that before. He said a few hurtful things: he didnt know if he wanted to be with me/loved me, that i wasnt adventurous and hinted towards an ex who was and listed some flaws in me im not the most organised person compared to him. He also said he felt like i was moving in and it was too much. It was hurtful and i was so confused, if he had just communicated this before i would have been very chill about it. He broke up with me and for a few days i couldnt stop texting him, he was back to being his kind self but was distant. i went quieter and tried to see my friends, and thats when it seemed to hit him, and he asked us to get back together after just a week apart. Hes not the type to love bomb at all, and when he is in his right mind he chooses his words incredibly carefully. he thought what he had done was irredeemable at first. He was remorseful, acknowledged everything he had done wrong, didnt put blame on me etc. His explanation was that as winter approaches he gets very depressed and he couldnt see clearly and was scared of the future. i wont go into details but a few years ago he had a life changing traumatic event that he never sought proper help for. He started antidepressants again at my request and we continued to be together for about 8-9 months. He was reassuring, still put in the exact amount of effort, promised me he had made the biggest mistake of his life and he would never do that to me again. things had been steady and nice since. we dont argue really, we go on days out all the time, its been amazing. He has been my biggest supporter and has done more for me than anyone ever has. He is so thoughtful and consistently lovely. We just got back from a holiday together on Tuesday for my birthday which he had organised and paid about 70 of. On Sunday, he started a conversation about how he was sad that he had made me feel like he would break my heart again as i was sometimes still needing reassurance about the break up. He looked like he was going to cry and was looking at pictures of all our trips and days out and said how much he appreciated me. Then he started saying he doesnt know if hes ready to give up his alone time. I told him im not going to move in right now, and even if/when i did, i like my own space too. for context about 2 months ago we spoke about the future, and he said he would like me to move in in about a year and how he wants children, and even said he could want them with me. i pointed out if he wants kids in his future he is going to have to give up a bit of his alone time for that regardless. it didnt feel like the right answer, then all of a sudden he switched back to that cold person he was when he broke up with me. To me it was almost comical at first and i really said are we doing this again and he just blankly said yep. He then went on to say the same stuff he doesnt know if he wants that with me, but then mentioned this ex girlfriend again, and instead this time said he wished he was still with her/misses her. This is what i posted about on another sub btw. He couldnt give me much reason other than when you meet that person you just know. he said he thought getting with me would make him feel more love but he doesnt know what he feels now and hasnt let go of that relationship. i was obviously absolutely crushed. Turns out, shes someone he spent one week with in Italy 3 YEARS ago. they had an online relationship for a few months after that until he broke it off. He only met her in real life that one week in Italy. she is the complete opposite to me it seems. she lives in California we are UK, she solo travels more than she is home. shes spiritual, independent, adventurous, seems exciting and fun etc. Im a bit of a quiet girl, i like collecting things, painting, peaceful nature, animals insects etc. im not loud but im not unhappy in myself. i also have some physical health issues right now that would make travelling hard for me. i can be an anxious person but i push myself a lot and im proud of how much i have done for myself. but of course it really felt like a slap in the face. he said some other hurtful things about me which i wont get into. I was crying for a long while and on Sunday and he was taking me home but i needed to pull over because i thought Id be sick. On the side of the road in my emotional state, i started talking about us, about how a year of memories with me was nothing compared to a girl he barely knows, and that i believed soul mates arent fate, but the love you create, and to idolise someone like that and expect perfection is the beginning of a downfall in a relationship anyway. he switched back up, hugged me, kissed me, then asked if i wanted to sleep in his spare room. i said yes, mainly because i didnt want to go home to my family when i was in such a state, and also Id be alone the next day as he had work and i could calm down and think a bit more. It seemed to be a break up again. we spoke that night and he was his normal self but i could tell he felt very bad about what he had done. he told me he realised he doesnt even know her anymore, doesnt love her and something inside him was trying to sabotage the relationship. he said he missed that time in his life because he felt like he was a better person back then. Id say more recently he has been a bit more bitter and snappy, i dont see him seeing the good in life as much, hes critical of his body and himself. he is also heavily invested in politics now, and it was getting too much for me and we spoke about it. i did tell him i thought he looked back at that time as a fantasy and not the real world he never lived with this girl, he doesnt know her faults, he literally just had an idealistic holiday with her and imagined thats what life would be like. he has spent a year doing the mundane with me, which we still enjoyed together and that is significant. He knew me inside out, he knew my quirks. someone also commented on my other post talking about avoidant attachment and when i read up on it, it was almost identical. i read it to him and he completely agreed. i spent another night at his but only because it got late talking and he had work again. The next morning he woke up and threw up multiple times, and generally seemed down. when he got home we had some small talk then spoke again. i wasnt crying this time, but he was a bit. we hugged and had a better conversation. He said the life we were talking about sounded like an incredible fantasy and he wished he could have it with me. He also said i was like the beam of light in his life and he genuinely has nothing bad to say about me, that i am all good and have been an amazing girlfriend. we kinda both acknowledged what he said was so damaging it couldnt continue right now, i did tell him many times it was irreparable and he said its the wrong thing for him to do to ask for me back. we were going to break up but decided on a break. i told him point blank he needs to get therapy. he does agree but i dont know if he will bother to. Part of me doesnt know how it could come back from this but i also hold on to hope, because without this avoidant side of him that clearly stems from trauma, he is the person i want to be with. he is everything i have wanted in a person otherwise. im aware i may sound naive and i can see it too. i know other people exist but i also know what i want, and my question mostly is if there is a way that we can work through this or he can work through it. i have seen people say its a fixable problem. i know its on him to decide to fix this in himself. i am not seeing him for a while and i have decided to join my parents holiday this weekend as a distraction. because of my illness, i am self employed so its not a huge distraction in the sense of being social. i have some good friends but they are very busy. i want to know maybe the logical side of his actions if it is related to being an avoidant attached person. so thats my question, is there a reasonable way to fix this relationship or am i losing self respect?",

    "title": "Public State University keeping student on waitlist",
    "text": "Location: Kansas I currently attend a public state university and I am 1 class away from graduating. This last class is a requirement for the curriculum and once I complete it, I will have my degree. I have been waiting on this class since last September and have periodically checked in with the university, everywhere from advisors to department heads. I am always given a false time on when I will start the class. I have been told next month or 3 weeks at least 8 different times and have this documented through emails. The climax of this situation was when I spoke to the department head and was told on the phone to wait 3 weeks or dropout. That is my only 2 options. That was 2 months ago at this point. The reason for the delay is due to the necessary equipment not being available. Obviously this delay in graduating has had many negative impacts on my life, the biggest not being able to pursue a career in my field of study. Is there any action I can take legally here to help me get my degree completed?",

    "text": "18F My mom clearly has mental health issues she often hears voices, says things like an angel came to take you, acts like shes possessed eyes wide open, shouting random things, and has disconnected thoughts. Sometimes she thinks shes the chosen one, and she can go from crying to screaming and destroying things in seconds. Then she forgets it like nothing happened. She refuses to go to a psychiatrist on her own and says my grandparents should take her there, but that never happens. So the cycle just continues. Shes done scary things: spitting on me, humiliating me in front of people, aggressively driving while shouting because I got 10/20 on a math test, she banged herself on the floor because I took the wrong médecine nothing dangerous, banged le against a wall because I couldnt memorize a subject i was too scared Once she even got naked and started walking around the house like she couldnt control herself. Other times, she threatens to kill herself when I try to go out or live my life. Im her punching bag, emotionally and in the past physically. I feel isolated, I cant go out, she picks me up from school even when its just 10 minutes away, and I feel like Im being choked by her constant presence. I have no social life. She ruins everything. She always blames her childhood, cries about being treated poorly when she was a kid but it never ends. Its always about her pain, never about the damage shes doing now. I love her, but I also resent her deeply. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so trapped.",

    "text": "Hello. I saw my job listed on indeed last night... thinking about texting this to my manager. I am still on the schedule. But want some clarity as ill be bussing there. Hey K, this is a bit awkward so Ill just come out and ask. I saw my job recommended to me on indeed. Im assuming that means you are letting someone go. Im definitely interested in working the shifts Im scheduled for this week and would appreciate if you could fill me in on whats going on My girlfriend is borrowing my car today so Id hate to bus all the way there if Im not needed to work. Sincerely, W Is it a good or bad idea to send this? Pros and cons would be appreciated. Obviously I had anxiety about this all night. I did actually have an interview that went well today but Im curious to know what I should do other than show up for my shift tonight and play dumb. Thanks",

    "title": "Is this the end for me 30M and my wife 31F? Lost, broken, hopeless, sad...",
    "text": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. Desperate for advice or opinions. Ill keep it as brief as I can but I have to paint the full picture of our relationship history. I 30M have been with my wife 31F since 2016, married since 2022. Thankfully no kids, no house, and no shared bank accounts, so a divorce would be about as clean of a break as could be, given the circumstances. Despite both of us coming from highly dysfunctional, abusive households, our outlooks and perspectives on life are totally different. My wife lives in a near-constant state of pessimism, anxiety, and anger. My outlook has always been that my childhood was so bad that once I got away from my family and branched out in my own, I would treat each day as a gift and remain positive, upbeat, and happy. I spent too long being held down so now I live my life as positively as possible. Since the beginning of our relationship met in college I pretty much knew what I was getting into but I blindly moved forward thinking things would naturally improve as relationships tend to steady over time. Not the case... some examples of what I should have taken as red flags early on: Six months into our relationship I took her to a childhood friends parents home so she could meet some of my long-time friends, both male and female. On the drive back home, she started punching the dashboard of my car from the passenger seat and more or less had a freak out because two of my long-time female friends were there and I talked to them. Yelling, punching the dashboard, accusing me of not giving her enough attention... yeah. A few months later we had a disagreement in our apartment not sure what it was about anymore but it resulted in her drawing a massive kitchen knife and holding it to her wrist, threatening to cut herself. Another fun experience. I should mention at this time she was on Zoloft for anxiety and would have anxiety attacks to the point she was non-functional, sobbing in our bed and unresponsive while I sat there and tried to soothe her. Id say this probably happened 5-10 times over the span of a year. We eventually did couples counseling and it worked out well. I ended up continuing on and doing individual therapy to address my childhood trauma. She refused to go to her own individual therapy at that time, which cut pretty deep and signaled to me she was fine with herself and didnt want to improve. Something I disagreed with but didnt press onto her about it. Since then, shes pretty regularly still having angry outbursts over tiny things. She constantly has road rage and yells at/about other drivers. As in, in a 10 minute trip to the grocery store she will cuss and make angry remarks literally every minute at any perceived bad driving she sees, even if it doesnt affect us/our car/our trip. I prefer to drive for this reason, since that is obviously stressful and tiring to hear. She also constantly gets mad at our dogs for barking, missing a potty they have potty pads to use inside and sometimes pee off the edge, gets mad at our youngest dog for not eating food in the morning despite the fact that he does it every day, etc. Will rage clean and slam doors, cuss at things, etc. Obviously this makes for an extremely stressful home life because she never shares her emotions or whats bothering her and I have no idea what little things will set her off on a daily basis. Things have more or less been fine besides what I just mentioned above. Shes no longer on Zoloft and hasnt been for years. We are both in highly successful careers and work from home. This is where it gets crazy... Last month, I sent my cousin 1000 because he is the only family member I keep up with and hes moving into his first apartment with his fiancée, so I wanted to give them a gift to help them get started with a new couch or decorations, put towards a down payment on a new car whatever they wanted really. We make 370K/yr combined, 260K from me and 110K from her. Money is not an issue for us, ever. I told her about it thinking she would be happy and understanding because she knows he is my closest relative and our relationship is very much a big brother/little brother relationship. Instead, she brought it up twice and was extremely angry about it both times, saying the money should have been spent a different way. That is nonsensical because we freely spend on any number of things in a given month, and is generally much more than 1000. Id had enough so I tried to leave the apartment and walk around to let us both cool off and have our space. She physically blocked me and attempted to push me away from the door, leaving scratches all over my arm as she tried to pull my arm back inside as I broke away and made it out the door. This is not the first time shes tried to physically barricade me from leaving our apartment after a disagreement. My hand is currently broken from an unrelated accident and she got between me and my surgery/injury/orthopedic surgeon documents when I needed to call my doctors office and needed the phone number during another disagreement last week. She physically held them back away from me while pushing me in my chest so I couldnt grab them... to me, that is evil. Thats all been addressed kind of but heres the major issue plaguing us right now. I brought up that she should consider individual therapy and mentioned how much it helped me and that maybe it would do the same for her. She finally broke down crying after hours of silence and said she would pursue it. Since then, shes reached out to two therapists in the area. One moved hours away to another city, while the other never got back to her. She gave up searching after this yes, really and decided the next best alternative was to download mindfulness/meditation apps on her iPad. Obviously not going to cut it but was supportive anyways since Ill take what I can get at this point. That was last week also. I asked her yesterday if she had checked any of them out and she got defensive and said no but that she would look into them soon. Its becoming increasingly clear to me that, despite my best efforts and continual support, she has no real interest in bettering herself or addressing her inner demons. Im now grieving a relationship that cost me nearly 10 years of my life and all of the anxiety, hurt, and missed opportunities that have accompanied it. Were supposed to buy a house later this year and have touted the idea of children next year but that sounds hysterically stupid as I reflect while typing this out. To be honest, Im also extremely nervous about how she will react if I mention it. While Im almost a foot taller than her and double her weight, that means nothing when we have hammers, kitchen knives, and other objects capable of causing bodily harm in the house. So, Reddit, when is divorce the right choice? Have I given it enough time? I will not live the rest of my life like this, in this relationship, and I have plainly stated that to her. Im open. Please hit me with it, straight-up.",

    "text": "I 20m got a partial tear to my shoulder labrum a few months ago while playing volleyball. Ive gotten it confirmed, and maybe I should be asking a more medical community, but even from a mindset perspective. Im in college, I dont have the money for that kind of surgery, at least not soon. And even when I do, itll probably be a year before I can play pain free. Which is assuming the surgery would go well. Sports are a huge part of my life, and they are one of my main ways of staying sane. Ive struggled with mental health in the past and I know that this will put me in a dark tunnel if I dont find something that means alot to me. I dont know how to do that. My pain isnt terrible, I know I should probably not just keep playing and allowing it to maybe get worse, but it honestly I dont know what else to do.",

My credit is in rough shape, and Ive got about 23K in student loansbut payments are paused until August, so that gives me a little breathing room. Im trying to figure out where to go from here. I want to start saving money, rebuild my credit, and possibly transition into a better-paying or more fulfilling career path. Is 30 too late to pivot? What trades, certifications, or paths would you recommend that are realistic and worth it? Any advice from people whove been hereor come out the other sidewould really help. Thanks in advance.",

Wed walk together, shed lean on me, let me touch her face, wed play around pushing each other and overall she was just confortable getting touchy with me from the start, a few times I got too touchy but she never seemed to mind, like Id pat her head and lay on her lap and vice versa. Wed spend time after class, go shopping, eat, flirt, joke around. Shed even say things like people think were a couple, and she didnt seem to mind it I genuinely liked being around her. I thought she liked it too. She used to send me seflies, memes, and sometimes just start dancing when I asked her to Then, it just shifted. Hard. She became cold, sarcastic, would insult me for no reason, started saying she wouldnt go out or drink with me, pushed me, then got mad if I touched her back. She blocked and unblocked me multiple times, sent and deleted messages, and when I finally asked her why she stopped talking to me, she said its because I was too dramatic I told her I never meant to bother her or disrespect her, and that Im done talking but she hit me with, Every time I start to forget you, you come back. I dont forgive. Then deleted the message. At some point she said to me was youre not in my head well, now you are then just blocked me again I dont even know how to read any of this anymore. I know its over and Im not trying to chase her anymore. Its just weird that someone who used to be so close turned into someone who treats me like I never mattered. Shed say we werent even friends, And yeah, maybe I stayed too long hoping shed come around Anyway, Im out of it. I just needed to write this down and wanted to try to atleast understand the situation",

    "text": "Location: SF Bay Area, California, USA Hi. Posting for a friend A who doesnt use Reddit lol. A runs a small business 50 with a business partner, B. A and B offer services to clients. A specializes in A-service and B specializes in B-service. Some clients use both services, but most of the money comes from A-service and lots of clients only want A-service. B cannot offer this service. A wants to start a new business without B. A would then recruit clients to the new business. A and B have a very bare bones contract that is at-will with no non-solicitation or non-compete agreement. Some questions: 1. Can A legally recruit clients to the new business while the old business still exists? 2. If A wants a lawyer to navigate this, what sort of lawyer does A need? A small business lawyer? I dont even know what to Google to find one. 3. Is it possible to find a lawyer to review a business agreement and advise on these questions for just a couple hours and a few hundred bucks? I have no idea what this process or these costs look like.",

We see each other about once a week, which I dont really like but the issue is its almost always on a Sunday. This to me just feels a little off. I cant help but think am I the Sunday girl? We are meant to be exclusive. He did tell me fairly early on 1 month I think? that he doesnt want to see anyone else, but I feel like my trust issues are getting in the way of me believing him. This is because he will never try and see me on another day, and he doesnt respond for long period of times in the evening. Im not sure if Im overthinking. We text like 2 times a day at most, but we used to text a bit more than that which makes me think he has either lost interest or he is just replying out of boredom now. Weve also argued a little bit because Im anxiously attached and have tried to leave before. Im not sure if this has been a deal breaker for him but he just hasnt told me and is only still talking to me for the sake of it? All my friends think he is terrible so Im not really sure what to think because he does seem to care about me asks lots of questions etc. Basically he is acting a bit more distant now so I just want to know if this is something I should be concerned about.",

    "title": "Long term partner wants to break up but I dont?",
    "text": "I 28 F have been with my partner 27 M for five years and we have lived together basically the whole relationship. Its an overall healthy relationship-- we communicate well, enjoy each others company, share interests and perspectives, like each others friends, the whole thing. Throughout our relationship one or both of us have been in school and I just graduated grad school last week. The past year has been rape i ally stressful as he graduated and started a new job and I was finishing up my degree, so weve grown somewhat distant but there has never been animosity or conflict. I was looking forward to graduating and being able to devote more time to rekindling things and rebuilding our communication as I simply havent had the mental capacity for it while also working on my thesis. However, on the last day of my graduation celebrations, my partner told me he wants to break up. He said it wasnt about the relationship and that he just wants to be alone to explore the world and figure his shit out. Hes never lived alone I have and he wants to be independent for the first time. I understand this perspective, but I feel like hes walking away from a strong, loving relationship that I see a future for. We talked about marriage within the last year, which is a huge step for me as I have been pretty opposed to it. But he is someone I can see myself marrying and growing even more with. We still have over a month of our lease left, so we have been having difficult conversations. Mostly, they consist of me trying to make him see what a good thing we have and how much exploring and growing we can do together. He said he would think about it, but Im pretty sure he made his mind up months ago. Something I think is relevant is he has been having family issues for a while which I will not detail here and I have been the only person in his life to prioritize him over everything else. Im afraid him going out on his own will isolate him even further and rid him of his biggest source of support. From my end, Im very afraid of restarting my life from scratch. I havent been preparing to live alone and dont think I can afford it, and his new job has lifted a lot of financial pressure for me. I also just dont know what I would do. I love him so much and am genuinely happy with him. This whole situation has been a shock to me, as I thought we were going through the normal ebbs and flows of a relationship and was looking forward to strengthening it even more now that we both finally have the time and mental space for it. What do I do? Im thinking about moving out of state if Im able to find a job, but that in itself is scary as Ive never left my home state and dont want to do it alone. This is all just a huge shift in my life plans, as I have spent the past five years expecting to continue building a life together with him. Now hes dropped this bomb and I only have a little over a month to find a whole new path I havent even thought about. Any advice is appreciated, I feel like Im drowning.",

    "text": "For context I M20s broke up with her because of distance, plus, some of the things she had said to me like I dont want to manipulate you anymore , I havent loved you for a couple months , My brother doesnt like you he only saw me once . All of which, very hurt me of course We dated for a year and a half, with half a year being long distance - 6 hrs. I asked for space and got some for a couple months, then she started messaging me during me wanting space. During that time, I was doing lots of self reflecting, doing things alone, and enjoying life but didnt have very many friends to talk to during the day. Since then, we have talked everyday texting and have been messaging for 2 years and 9 months straight. Its been 4 years since we broke up or so Im not really sure where I stand with her, maybe just friends, or acquaintances now? but I want to ask her to be my date to my brothers wedding next year, but Im unsure. What should I do?",

    "text": "Warning: Suicidal thoughts To start with I F have autism its probably Aspergers and Im showing traces of having AuDHD. I live my life to research neuroengineering and maybe find ways to achieve direct communication through artificial neural networks. Im not religious nor I deny god. I just believe that the purpose of my existence is to continue existing both physically and mentally. To get back to the topic. During break I feel like I dont exist anymore, or more like Ive lost my purpose of living all of a sudden. I wont be able to study for a few months. However everyone around me is continuing their studies. I dont have a lover, nor do I search for one at the moment. So Im basically all alone all day and my head wont stop. Im causing over stimulation to myself with all these thinking. These days I find comfort in thinking about death. I find myself walking at dark alleys hoping that someone would kill me. I cant even process why these thoughts are peaceful. I want to live for myself but it feels meaningless. I tried to live for others, but it only hurts myself. I thought about living to be happy but if thats my purpose then logically I should just use drugs to reach happiness and die after my battery is finished. I love my purpose right now but its not viable all the time. I have loving people around me, thats not it, I dont have a bad life. Im just sad that I cant even rest properly during breaks. This year I over worked myself too much and when Its all finished like this I should be able to breath, but I cant. I dont know who I am anymore. Before working/studying I dont remember what I used to do. Im not sure if I know how to have fun anymore. I feel like I could break any moment, but at the same time always carrying myself carefully draines me. I dont know how to act around people which I dont see as often anymore. I dont want to be depressing but you cant call me cheerful. I dont know what part of me to suppress and what part of me to show because all my personality depended on logic this year and I dont even know If I have a spark of excitement in me anymore. Any advice on how to get rid of dreaming about dying? Or getting myself back? Or how to just rest peacefully during break?",

    "text": "Location: Kansas People commonly attribute cheating to unhappy relationships, opportunity, distance, alcohol, etc. Its true that otherwise faithful people might cheat in those circumstances -- but not everyone in those circumstances respond by cheating. Some people break up, others try to work it out, others stay, etc. People are prone to responding in different ways to the same trigger. If I honk at someone, they might ignore it or they might chase me down the highway for miles with a shotgun. Is my honking what determined their behavior, or is it the interaction that occurred between the stimulus honking and their underlying tendencies? Its analogous to lighting a spark in a room with a gas leak vs a regular room. Is it the spark itself that caused the explosion in the gas-filled room or is it the interaction between the spark and the presence of gas that caused the explosion? The same spark in a regular room would do nothing. So when someone cheats, its not just the external circumstance -- dissatisfaction, alcohol, distance -- that explains the behavior. Its how that circumstance interacts with the persons internal makeup: their values, impulse control, past experiences, and predispositions. In other words, Person-Situation Interactionism applies to relationship cheating: the trigger matters, but so does what its triggering.",

    "title": "Predatory title loan - rent-a-bank scheme, illegal interest rates in my state",
    "text": "Location: Minnesota Hi everyone, Im looking for advice.. In 2022, I took out a title loan that was issued through an out-of-state bank and serviced by a third-party lender. The APR ended up being over 90, which I later learned exceeded my states legal interest cap of 36. Ive since filed complaints with multiple regulators including the CFPB, Attorney general and two others. Over the past two weeks, Ive been in direct contact with their General Counsel, who is representing both companies. They offered a settlement that included: A refund of interest paid over 36 Cancellation of the remaining balance, Release of the vehicle title. While I was initially open to settlement, the agreement included a broad non-disclosure clause that would bar me from discussing the loan or my experience. I explained that, if Im being asked to waive my rights to speak publicly, the refund should reflect the value of that silence. They requested a counteroffer from me, which I provided - reasonable, modest, and professionally worded. I even left room for them to propose a different figure. Instead of negotiating, they rejected it outright and declined further engagement. Their conduct suggests the request for a counteroffer was performative rather than a genuine effort to resolve. Their legal counsel has been dismissive, unprofessional, and needlessly adversarial, despite my own efforts to remain civil and constructive throughout. This company is exploiting borrowers nationwide by bypassing state lending protections using out-of-state charters. If Im going to be silenced, I want the refund to reflect the value of that loss. If not, Id like to teach others how to advocate for themselves and pursue the same relief I was offered. At this point, im wondering if I should sign their agreement or keep fighting. Ive done everything I can through the proper channels and have documentation of the entire process emails, proposed settlement, complaint filings, etc. Has anyone here dealt with a similar high-interest title loan or out-of-state lending model? Thanks in advance for any guidance",

    "text": "Location: Maryland, United States Now back home from international travel to celebrate a family event. It was a short trip and I had my family spouse and minor kids with me so it was a bit chaotic. At check out on the last day, I double checked we hadnt left anything behind but upon returning home, I first noticed my Apple Watch and AirPods were missing I dropped the ball on this one because I didnt have the find my feature activated on either. As the days progressed, I discovered the extent of the theft. Most of my jewelry which Id have put in one large ziploc including the Watch was carted away. We had connecting flights back and I have written to the airports just to cover all bases and heard back from some. We had some bags checked in but these just had clothes and shoes in them. I contacted the hotel and they mentioned wanting to do an investigation but this didnt help as their security cameras are only outside and they said they found nothing. As with any loss, this has been distressing for me as some of the jewelry hold a sentimental value so besides contacting the hotel, filing a police report, and contacting the embassy, how can I use social media to reach far and wide in attempting to possibly locate my stolen items since this happened in another country? Ofcourse I have learnt a huge lesson for next time.",

Its not a list of budgeting hacks. Its not a buy this one ETF video either. Its more of a deep dive a personal investigation into why so many of us feel financially stuck, even when were technically doing okay. In the video, I explore: Why the classic advice like save 10, buy a home doesnt work for most of us anymore How invisible costs like subscriptions, BNPL, and convenience fees quietly drain our wallets How your zip code might matter more than your income And why AI could actually help, not replace us, but give us back control I made this in the style of the video I wish I had when I was blaming myself for being bad with money, before I realized the game had changed, and the old playbook was useless. If you have a few minutes, Id love for you to check it out. And even more than views Im genuinely looking for feedback. Link herehttps://youtu.be/OOzhMcJjoqg?siO_ZgZQM0_rtfN7e5",

I could see they were in shock, I watched them reverse a bit and fix their parking behind the Tesla. At this point I started to record to get some evidence. I wanted to see what they would do but they spent some time in the car and eventually got out and finished making their deliveries and then drove off. I did go out and take a photo of the back of the USPS vehicle to identify it. There is visible damage to the Tesla which also made it knock into this old Cadillac that didnt budge. I know the Tesla owner live around here as I see that car frequently parked around. Im wondering if I should leave a note on the Tesla saying something along the lines of USPS hit your vehicle and I have their vehicle on video with my if they want to call to get the information? Or should I just leave it alone?",

    "text": "So Ive been talking to this girl for about 2 and a half months, and we get along extremely well shes probably the first girl that understands me as much as she does. We met online and she lives just a couple hours away Im in Washington shes in Canada and Im supposed to go see her on Sunday. So for some backstory shes had some very bad experiences with past exes including one that was just under a year ago so with that shes obviously very anxious and all that about letting a guy in but despite that weve gotten really close cause we understand each other. But just the other night she sent me this long message basically saying despite how hard she is trying she doesnt think shes ready for an actual relationship cause she wants to give her heart more time to heal and wants to wait til shes ready so she can love to her max ability. Of course I was understanding and told her Im willing to be as patient as she needs cause I told her shes worth it. But with that I can get pretty bad anxiety and I overthink a lot. And with that I have two sides, the optimistic side that wants to go with what she said and be patient and that thats all it is but the anxious and overthinking side of me Im fighting is that the reason she said that is because she realized Im not what she wants or that theres another guy I dont know about. Thing is shes never said or done anything to make me not trust what she says but of course my anxiety gets the best of me. With all this she still wants me to come down on Sunday but she says as friends and doesnt want to push anything which i understand and want to be patient like I said. I just want any tips on what to do about this anxiety and overthinking. Or am I over my head? Thing is I have pretty deep feelings for her not sure if its in love but I like her quite a lot at the least so if I decided this is too much the only thing I know what to do is to drop her from my life completely and move on cause I wouldnt be able to go on as long term friends cause my heart wouldnt be able to take it. Tips and advice please. Kinda losing my mind over this",

Due to a number of complicated events I was left with practically nothing in regards to my husbands assets, he was a restaurant owner - so Im pretty much starting from scratch with no money, 3 children and very little support. Ive been working part time in an entry level job for about 9 months that Im starting to really hate, it provides just enough money to get by but the majority of my income is now dependent on state benefits and I do not want to continue to live month to month without any real long term solutions. I want advice, as Im sick of just surviving. What can I do? Is there a genuine way to make money online which has actual prospects long term. Ive looked into courses - in the hope to get qualified to do something - mostly within administration/childcare. Im also constantly applying for jobs but Im limited in regards to anything I can do is limited to my childrens school day 9am-3pm",

Monthly payment 122 Car is paid off and in good shape. Income: 4,000 / month from job after 4 403b contribution to get match 875 my boyfriend gives me for his part of rent/utilities Total Expenses: 3,165 not including the 300/month I currently put into Roth IRA. Retirement is not where Id like it to be for my age but I only started about a year ago. 403b: 5.3k Roth IRA: 2.8k What would you do with 1700 surplus? Should I keep adding to EF for now or beef up my retirement? There is minor work Id like to do to my house but nothing pressing. I can always do that later, but I know you can only contribute so much to Roth IRA in a year. I could meet the max in 3 months if I threw everything at it. Would this be the best thing to do? Please help me pull the trigger if so.",

    "text": "need some honest help here. i graduated college last year and started my job in September. it only pays once a month, which has been really hard for me to budget with. when i first started, i developed a pretty heavy spending addiction, especially using pay later apps like affirm and klarna. i also maxed out a couple credit cards 4 to be exact, but i have since paid one off entirely!!. Im wondering if it would be a good idea to take out a personal loan of about 10k to pay off the balances on all of these cards and pay laters. right now, credit card payments and payment due dates for pay laters are eating up my monthly income im probably spending over 1500 dollars a month on payments and i feel like it might be better to combine them all. Ive heard it can be a bad idea for certain situations, but im not sure if it would be helpful for me?",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for 4 months now, Ive known him as a friend for 2 years. We masturbated on a vc almost a week ago and just after that were in an argument. Yesterday we talked on a call after a week of on and off silence, i tried to talk to him about what we did on the vc,twicehe was uploading a story and the topic shifted and the third time i asked he seemed to have forgotten about it,which kinda hurt,Ive told him that I need to talk about things we do to feel appreciated,but that was when I sent him a pic and got no response for it, and apparently i wasnt specific enough.sure. This is the first time Ive been consentually intimate with someone irl. He knows about the assault that happened 3 years ago. So when I brought it up on the call i broke down and started crying,he said hed talk about our moments from here on out, But i could hear him hesitating and it felt forced and while I was emotional i said just that.it sounds forced.I know i was emotional and that what i said was unnecessary and hurtful, i apologized after a few minutes. He said hed go sleep and when I asked him to stay he raised his voice and left the call, i felt bad cause I was still crying and wanted to see him atleast try to talk me through it. It was 2:30 am so i understand why hed wanna leave but if I was in his place I dont see myself doing that.i also understand that I cant expect that out of him just because i would do it without hesitation. I feel scared to be emotional or a little unstable and rely on him cause if I say anything borderline unpleasant- I ruin his moodHis words. He is an introvert and i understand if its hard for him to bring up conversations but pushing me away when I bring it up feels horrible. Is there anything I can do to improve or fix this? Do i stop expecting? Im confused and hurt ,any advice would help alot. thankyou for reading this mess.",

But he hasnt paid in years because he keeps moving. Apparently everytime he gets court ordered, he pays the minimum payment then moves to somewhere else in the same town - violating court orders and mandates. Every so often my friend tracks him down and the same thing happens. I have his name and the town he lives in. Am currently trying to find him. Once I do, Is there anything I could do to get him to pay? He seems like he would just violate any court orders thrown at him. Location: Ontario, Canada",

I decided to break up with him and the second I did I regretted it. We spoke daily for 9 months after till he cut contact with me one day. 3 days ago I had a dream about him and have been crying on and off for the past 3 days. I saw him today and it absolutely broke me. I know I shouldnt reach out, but I just feel so lost and dont know what to do. Its been so long and I was good for a long time but now it feels like my heart has been ripped out and stomped on all over again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

It tried to make conversation, but he didnt really say much. Then we walked to the library to study. I asked him if everything is okay, to which he answers that he is still not feeling fully recovered he had a cold recently. Then I suggested to go to the doctor which I have already done a few times since this cold really wont go away. Al of a sudden he kinda snapped and said something mean to me. Was it unreasonable or should I have done something different? This kinda pissed me off, but I didnt say anything and we just walked the rest in silence. Later there was also another instance where he reacted really strongly to a simple miscommunication. The thing is, this morning everything was great and yesterday too. Usually he is really the best und sweetest most caring person, but then there are moments like these where he is in such a bad mood all of sudden or where he just seems annoyed by me talking. I really dont know what to do. Now he is texting normally again. I want to approach this problem since it is definitely bothering me, but idk how. Help me guys haha.",

    "title": "Moms best friends daughter died, but I cant be fully emotionally invested, am I a cold piece of shit? I feel trapped.",
    "text": "So my mom, who died in 2021, had a best friend, which has a daughter and a son. Im not very close to them but she asks for help with PC stuff occassionally, we dont talk for months, and meet on occassion memorial days etc.. I know her kids way less than her. I never call first, I lack interest in friendship with her, or anyone to be honest. Now this saturday her 19yo daughter died, I wont go into detail how, but her mom called me saturday and I didnt pick up didnt feel like talking, except for my psychologist. She sent me a voice message which I didnt listen to aswell, which she deleted next day, I thought its the usual paperwork or PC stuff but solved itself already, then I responded, she called me again and told me her daughter died. Then we talked for around two hours and I cried even because she told me some things I thought wrong about what her daughter thought of me, my confidence is peak low, I thought she hated me, but it was the opposite and its crushing my guts. I mostly listened, but when related to something then I was able to talk freely. I didnt know what else to say except to be there and understand what she goes through, I still felt like I was an inconsiderate prick and could have said things like she is there, even if you dont see her after she said I want her to be close but I dont see her, I just dont know how I can say these cringeworthy things even if I think its BS, I dont want to be fake and say what I dont believe in like god and ghosts, but I also cant tell her that when shes right now being emotionally vulnerable like that, I felt trapped so I just agreed and tried to say maybe she is there, as long you think about her or similar Then when the call started to stagnate and she wanted to hang up, I told her she can call me if she wants to talk. After the call, I thought a few minutes, and went off with my day like something happened but I dont feel the same sadness as I felt with my mom for example. Mom would be 100 emotional pain vs moms friends daughter 5 at tops. I know I went through this stuff when my mom died, I honestly still am not out of the depression, she was best in my life, and now I just feel numb and wanna stay alone and listen to music, do my daily stuff and recreate. Am I blocking it out or am I just a cold person? Is it even okay not to engage? Im afraid she might do something to herself because of this state plus alcohol, and what if she does and I wasnt there while I could, Id blame myself endlessly. I know if I start to initiate, she will think Im emotionally invested and when she calls I will pickup but I will never call first,, so I just dont want to give her false hopes. If she calls me I will pickup and find time no problem, out of respect and understanding. I just never know what to say when people say some things which make me super self conscious and overthink instantly if it comes off as wrong or similar.",

    "title": "Is it realistic to think about buying a home soonor should I just rent to protect my peace?",
    "text": "Hi everyone, Im 24 F, single, no kids and trying to make a major life decision: is it realistic for me to aim for homeownership soon, or should I rent and focus on stability and peace of mind for now? Some background: From age 1618, I was fully independentworking full time, going to school full time, and living in my own condo. My credit was excellent, and I was managing life well on my own. At 18, I entered a long-term relationship with a man 12 years older. Over 6 years, it became emotionally, physically, and financially abusive. I initially maintained my independence, but over time, the control and manipulation escalated. By the end, I had completely lost my sense of self, my financial freedom, and my mental stability. During that breakup, I also suffered a serious car accident that left me unemployed, without transportation, and in a really dark place. I spiraled hardmentally and financiallyand ended up with about 30k in collections and 10k in student debt. Where Im at now: I moved back in with my dad, which has been a blessing in terms of not paying rentbut also very stressful emotionally. Im now mentally stable and focused. I recently landed a remote full-time job with a 70k base salary and potential to earn 100110k with commissions. My only bills are car insurance 150/month and my phone. My car is paid off. Ive been directing almost all my income toward debt repayment, savings, and rebuilding my financial life. Current living situation: I live with my dad, stepmom, and little brother in a remote area far from the city and the life Im used to. My dad and stepmom are constantly at oddshostile energy, passive aggression, fighting behind closed doors. They sleep in separate rooms and barely speak, but the tension fills the house. It often feels emotionally heavy and toxic. I frequently get triggered by their dynamic because it reminds me of my past abusive relationship. I feel trapped, isolated, and anxious in this environment. Im also craving independenceI miss having privacy, freedom, and space to just exist without judgment or drama. I want to host friends, go on dates, and simply live without chaos. My dad encourages me to stay and save money as long as I need to buy a home, and to not worry about his relationship as he is fine and plans to divorce and sell the house once Im back on my feet. This also puts additional stress on me. What Im wondering: 1 Should I stick it out at my dads to focus on saving, paying off debt, and eventually buying a home or condo? If thats the smartest route, how long would I realistically need to save? How much should I be putting aside each month? And what are the most effective ways to rebuild my credit currently in the 500s so I can qualify for a mortgage sooner rather than later? 2 Or is it better to prioritize my peace, mental health, and independenceeven if that means renting for a while? Would getting my own place now, even if it delays homeownership, be worth it in terms of emotional wellbeing and personal growth? Im tired of walking on eggshells and feeling stuck in a toxic, triggering environment. Is it wiser to create a healthy space for myself now and work toward buying later? Im looking for advice on a major life decision and would really appreciate any guidance from people whove been through something similar or just know the ins and outs of personal finance and homeownership. Thank you so much!",

Now that spring has started, I mostly wear skinny jeans with wedge sandals. I find skinny jeans much classier than baggy ones. I also like wedge sandals because the heel makes them look stylish and they are actually quite comfortable. I dont wear nail polish on my fingernails but I do like wearing red polish on my toenails. Ive noticed that I rarely see other girls my age wearing the kinds of things I wear. These things are mostly associated with older women. Do my fashion choices make me look older?",

Ill walk up to them and try to say something or ask a question and they keep talking as if Im not there. If I really want to say something badly I basically have to yell it out loud or say hey really loudly, or ask if I can speak. They will say go ahead and let me talk then halfway through my sentence one of them, usually my sister but not always willing interrupt and talk about something else. Then the other person will respond and go back to their conversation. It is beyond fucking frustrating and I am starting to hate my sister over this and I dont want to. I dont want to complain about how I am feeling to them but I told my mom once it makes me feel invisible, she felt sorry and tried to make an effort to listen to me but the next day and since then she has kept doing it.",

    "text": "Hi! Im posting on here because I dont have any family to ask for advice and to be honest, therapy is very expensive lol. Sorry about the really confusing title. Im rushing to write this on my break. So to start Im 21f. I share a 3 year old daughter with my ex, whos 34m. We broke up last year, and it wasnt a mutual decision, it was me who left him. Hes been doing everything in his power to get back together. I have custody of our daughter most of the time and he has visitation. But does things like: 1 when I am with our daughter he will drive by my house when we are playing outside and honk and wave and pull over and say things to her like do you want daddy to get out and play with you? Of course my daughter says yes. He claims he is just driving by but our neighborhood is very in the middle of nowhere and not really near anything. The first few times he did this he stayed over for over three hours each time and it was very uncomfortable getting him to leave. He said he cant help it hes driving by. 2 he bought our daughter an iPad and tries to FaceTime her 3-4 times a day, but shes so young she really cant FaceTime for more than a minute or two. Whenever she gets fidgety he tells me to just put the iPad in whatever room shes in so he can watch her play, but Im not comfortable with that because our house is pretty small and she likes to play wherever I am so I feel like hes also watching me. 3 kind of similar to number one but he also comes to places where he knows shes going to be at the library for mommy and me story time, at her playgroup, etc and says its just a coincidence hes there at the same time as us. I sent him a text asking him to please stop doing these things and to only see our daughter at the court approved visitation times. He told me that Im trying to control his life and where he goes and its ridiculous to suggest that he just pretends his daughter doesnt exist when he sees her at these places. But he also makes it out like Im the bad guy whenever I dont let him stay for example hell say things like i wish i could play with you longer but mommy says I have to leave or mommy says I cant stay and put you to bed and stuff like that, and last time he saw her he said now dont get sad if you see daddy around and I dont wave at you, mommy says I have to ignore you. I just want to know what I can say to him to get him to see why this is unreasonable?? If theres a way I can put it or explain it? Thank you guys for reading this far",

    "text": "Today, my girlfriend called me to go to a party together. Then she revealed that her friend would go with us. Im not really into parties or other things that single people usually enjoy things my girlfriend thinks are cool although shes not really into them either, because she never had the chance, like frat parties, university events, drinking, nightclubs. So, I thought: if I hadnt agreed, she would have gone with her friend without me. That sucks. TLDR: I dont like the kind of plans my girlfriend finds cool. Should I break up with her? Should I ask her not to go? Should I let her go alone?",

    "text": "Met my best female friend 25 years ago, my wife 10 years ago. From the beginning I tought my friend is the most wholesome person I ever met and attractive too. So of course in the first year I would have liked more. But I somehow went on a date with her far too late 3 months after spending time together every week and then I didnt manage to switch out of already existing friendship. After our time at the university we only have seen each other every few months, but all these 25 years we never stopped chatting digitaly, a lot I would say a few hours per week. Today we both have a family of our own and of course I love mine. But still, sometimes when I meet her again I think that all things considering me friend would be my most true Soulmate. As mentioned, I love my wife and havent truly thought about beeing in a relationship with my friend for 15 years. Also I do not think about changing the relationship to her or my wife. Do you think it is possible to continue that way, or that it will inevitably lead to damaging one of the relationships?",

    "text": "Hi everyone I have been crushing on a co-worker at work. So I got a new job 8 months ago and I got introduced to my co-worker, we work in a very small departement of only 3 people myself included. At first I just thought she looked nice but slowly over the last couple months I have been developing a big crush on her. We often do some overtime and most of the time were by ourselves then. And from time too time we have some nice and long conversations. Mostly we keep to ourselves though when we work because we both are insanly busy so we dont have much time talk. Her desk is right in front of mine with a small partition between us, but when I ask her something work related or Im talking to somebody else, I see her pop her head out a little and its honestly so adorable, it makes me smile everytime. Last friday however was when I completely fell for her. So we were going on a company outing and I offered to carpool because she lived on the way to where we needed to go, however it wasnt really, I drove an extra hour to pick her up. Anyway I picked her up we, we had to drive about an hour and talked the entire time. I found it genuinly amazing, I could also tell from her body language she was having a good time. I learned so much about her private life. When we were on the outing she even made a teasing comment towards me, I couldnt stop smiling in my head. On the way home, same deal we talked good, shared some stuff overall one of my best carrides by far. When I dropped her off I asked if she wanted to grab lunch but she still had some leftovers at home so politely declined. Afterwards we texted a bit more and that was that. So next monday we have another outing together and was debating wether I should ask to carpool again. However this time she completely lives in the other direction of where we need to go, so it would genuinly make 0 sense to do it. However do I still ask her to carpool? Secondly can I realisticly persue this? Its easy to think if it works out itll all be fine but Im thinking a lot about how it could not work-out fine. I think its an important decission since well be working together for the foreseeable future Anyone have any experience in this position. All advice is welcome, thank you in advance!

Now she suddenly more than doubled her prices, so obviously my GF is quitting now. But heres the deal: when my GF asks to share the pictures that she took while working for her, she doesnt want to share them. According to her, she doesnt want another person to use them and claim she made them. But as far as I know, when someone pays a person for any creative work, like photos or videos or even paintings for that matter, the owner is the one who pays for that work. Is that correct?",

Im not talking about toxic, possessive jealousy, but even when Im hanging out with female friends or get a little flirty attention from someone else, shes just unbothered. Shell even joke about it, like oh, youre so popular or have fun! without a hint of concern. Part of me appreciates that shes secure and trusts me, but another part of me wonders if she just doesnt care as much as I do? Like, Id be at least a little annoyed if the roles were reversed.

Our relationship wasnt exactly going smooth. He became distant. Very distant. And honestly I dont recall doing anything that might have set it off. Things were smooth. It was peaceful. I gave him enough space and he was understanding. Up until now . He just stopped caring. Doesnt text. Doesnt bother. This was the guy who was apparently head over heels for me. I end up thinking what I did wrong everytime he does that. I , incessantly ,keep blaming myself even though I havent done anything. I either feel like Im not lovable enough or not pretty enough. I dont understand what I even did to deserve this. And everytime I bring this up - he keeps denying that anything is even wrong atp. I am so drained and it is really bothering me to the point where my mental health is really affected. What is actually going on?",

    "title": "Moongrades breakdown weirdly echoed something my therapist said years ago. What would you do with info like this?",
    "text": "So this is kind of odd. Im not usually someone who dives into star stuff or planetary charts. Ive always liked logic and data psychology, journaling, and reflection. But lately Ive been feeling like Im repeating cycles in my life, especially in how I handle pressure, success, and emotional closeness. Out of curiosity and maybe frustration, I tried something a friend recommended, its a thing called Moongrade that maps your chart and kind of dissects your tendencies, blockages, all that. I figured it would be generic fluff. But one sentence in there stopped me cold. It said something like: You often feel responsible for the emotional state of others, even when its not your burden. The reason that hit so hard is because, years ago, my therapist said almost those exact words. I brushed it off back then. But reading it again, from something totally unrelated, felt like being confronted with a truth I never processed. So now Im sitting here wondering: when something outside of you especially something kind of random mirrors something deep youve been told before is that worth listening to? Is it just a coincidence? Or a sign its finally time to act on it? Im not asking if I should believe in astrology. Im asking: Have you ever been nudged by life from a strange place and it turned out to be the truth you needed? How did you stop dismissing it and actually start making changes? Im ready to break out of the old loops. But unsure where to start. Would love to hear your experiences or advice. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": "I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. Early on we agreed no kids and no marriage. Our relationship of 6 years has been rocky lately. Work, family, and financial issues have caused us to be at odds. Miscommunication is constant. Most recently, we had unprotected sex after a fun night. We carelessly finished with me still inside her. We both agreed to take a plan B the very next morning. She recently started her period and the discharge was heavy, brown and black. After a quick google search, she came to the conclusion that she may have actually been pregnant but the plan b put a stop to it. Despite talks about having kids me against and her pro until very recently she seems devastated at the fact that she may have lost our child. When she told me, I held her and attempted to reassure her. She told me she wanted to be alone, and after six years I understand she MEANS it. I gave her some space and attempted to talk to her a couple of times after. She is distant and didnt want to talk to me. I dont know what this means for us. Do I wait for her to open up and talk to me? Do I just engage in conversation?",

    "title": "Should I tell my exes new partner about his cheating?",
    "text": "My ex M38 and I F33 split almost 3 years ago now. We were together for 5 years and in the last year of that he got to know his now girlfriend F28. The breakup was a little messy but we did a great job being amicable and have remained friends. They got together more or less immediately after we split. He told me he never cheated on me and at the time I had no reason to question it. Over the course of the last 3 years, there have been a handful of times me and ex have hooked up. A couple of times when we were still living together, a drunken night out after that and a couple other times. He felt very guilty after the first time but seemed unbothered after that. For context, I have been single since the split with a handful of short term relationships and dating. He wants us to stay friends. We meet up every few weeks for coffee and catch up. Part of me wants to let his new not really new anymore though, right? partner know. I was her age when I started dating him and I could have saved my and his time if Id known how he is willing to treat his partner. Its clear to me now that he likely would have been doing the same to me then as he is doing to her now. Another part of me wonders why should I bother. Their relationship is none of my business anyway. At some point him and I will stop crossing paths. Long time reader, first time poster.",

I definitely didnt want to but its for the best. He got mad and Im not sure hell ever talk to me again. We didnt even meet yet it was all online. Despite how short it was, our connection was intense, felt like Ive known him for years. I got attached and Im missing him a lot. Everything was obviously mutual and probably even more on his side. I didnt like him immediately. I even have proof that hes still checking my socials lol. Id say I felt more emotions than my in long term relationship. How would you explain that? And how can I take my mind off of him?",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I are both 19 and college freshmen. Ever since we started doing long distance for school, the physical side of our relationship has basically disappeared, even when we visit each other in person. Its been around 8 months since weve had any real physical intimacy, and its starting to really weigh on me. Obviously I knew it would slow down since we would see each other in person less but I didnt expect everything to stop completely. Our schools are also only about an hour apart so we still see eachother decently often. Ive brought it up a few times, and she usually just says she doesnt know why she doesnt feel a desire for it anymore. She also says that trying to figure it out feels like a chore. Shes also stopped giving me physical compliments entirely, which Ive also mentioned to her, but nothing really changes. I dont want her to feel pressured or to force herself into anything shes not comfortable with, and I care about her deeply. But at the same time, I feel really disconnected and lost. I think physical intimacy is a natural and important part of a healthy relationship, and its hard not to feel rejected or unwanted. What can I do about this or how can I talk about it differently to her?",

Unfortunately we dont live in the same city so were unable to see each until the text term. When we started talking we were talking consistently everyday all day. He responded quickly and we were having full blown conversations. Flash forward to now he seems to be a bit more distant and not wanting to talk as much. I cant help but think its me overthinking and hes life has just gotten busier, but hell be active and still not respond to me 40 mins to an hour later. Meanwhile, I still always want to talk to him. I dont expect to talk to him all the time but it just feels like we havent had a regular conversation in a while like we used to. I just dont want to be led on. I am wondering if I should ask him whats been going on the last few days and see where he stands? Or should I just leave it? Thanks!",

    "title": "Title IX broke confidentiality, now what?",
    "text": "I currently have a criminal case ongoing so Im going to be as vague as possible on details, sorry. Location: California. My ex partner hurt me very badly and the local police reported it to my university. That started a title IX investigation, which according to a lot of people family/friends that are lawyers in my life was mishandled horribly. My parents not only moved me back home but we also moved out of our old house and into a new one. They were concerned about the threats that were made if I went to the police. I told this to title IX many many times and I was promised for months that my current address would be redacted. Not to mention that DAs told them to keep it private as well. In most of the reports it was, however, in the final report they accidentally left it in on one of the medical notes. When I called to tell them that they said they would look into it and apologized for the mistake and well he probably already has seen it by now so what do you want us to do? Yes thats what they said then ghosted me. I was told that from that point on I couldnt contact them directly anymore. I had the personal number of the head of the department and he blocked me after I had called and they refused to address my concerns. There are a few other things that had happened but the main thing myself and my family are upset about is that they gave my abuser my new location. I had a meeting with my prosecutor and detective recently and they told me to seek legal advise because it was very wrong what they did. My family is in a rage right now and I dont know what to do. My cousin criminal defense told me that any lawyer would jump on suing a major university any day of the week but I have no clue where to start. Im so tired. I dont know where to go or who to ask for help. I dont have enough money for a lawyer. What do I do Reddit? How do I look for a lawyer? Would anyone even care? Is this even a case? All I know is I agree with my prosecutor that this shouldnt have happened and dont want any other young women to feel how Im feeling right now. Please excuse any grammar mistakes. Im mentally struggling and simply dont have the energy to care. Im coming on here out of pure desperation so please be nice. Thank you!",

Im not expecting you to suddenly change your choice but I hope you understand. It made me distrust you because you said you were gonna use credit karma but then you looked through it. I also didnt like you saying youd basically make choices for me I really didnt like that because I still wanna be able to make my own choices. And what Im talking about is when you said youd take me out of town. Im trying my best and I talked to my therapist about this and she said she didnt see what was wrong with me having a lot of screen time as long as I got things done and did my schoolwork well. And Im not saying I should always be on my phone but I still hang out with people when I can and I try to enjoy my time at the house. I really just want you to allow me to make my own choices and respect me as an adult. I understand if youre angry at me for saying this but I feel hurt and I know that might sound stupid but Im just being honest My brother in laws reply : Ill have to unpack this later. But I just wanted to at least hear about this. I definitely know you were upset. But not talking to us is also not an answer",

Never called in sick, even when I got covid 2 years ago. Always pushed through. Last night I had a very compressed chest, the area near the heart hurt I had a headache.
