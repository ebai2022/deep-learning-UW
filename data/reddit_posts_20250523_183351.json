    "title": "does he have feelings?or he just enjoys my company and sees me as just a friend?",
    "text": "Okay so, Ive known this guy for years. Hes my senior and yeah, weve met and seen each other in real life so many times. But the thing is, I seriously dont know if he just sees me as a friend or if theres something more. Im really confused, and this has been in my head for a while. He always texts me. Even when I dont reply or I go quiet for some time, hell make up a reason to message me. Like literally anything some random excuse just to keep talking. And whenever he sees Im online, he calls. And when we call, theres no topic at all, we just blabber and talk about nonsense. No serious thing, just pure chaos sometimes.and mostly we end up talking for hours He does talk about marriage and stuff. And once when we were on call, he said things like, Looks dont matter to me, its about personality and vibe. But I dont know if he meant it in a general way or lowkey hinting something. Because Im actually very overweight, like genuinely fat. And hes the opposite very thin and actually attractive. Like, he gets proposals, girls like him. He has opposite gender friends too. But out of all my guy friends, hes the closest. And I dont even know if he talks like this like this close with other girls or not.i basically talk to only him. We have this funny list where we randomly add names of people we might like, and we tease each other about it. If I mention a guy even once, he remembers and later teases me using that name. Same way, I tease him about a couple of girls he talks about. Sometimes he denies liking them, sometimes he plays along playfully He doesnt usually talk about his day or things like that, but he seems super excited when he tells me something or share some secret. And iam the one he only gossipes with in my knowledge And I feel like I might be the one he shares it with first. And yeah, whenever I try taking space or not talking, hell still message me. Its like he doesnt want the convo to die. Now heres the thing. We dont talk about our families at all. Once I mentioned his brother and he literally said dont drag my brother into this and shut it down. So family talks zero And I dont know, Im not confident. Like I said, Im overweight and honestly I feel ugly. He never compliments me or says anything nice, but at the same time, he doesnt disappear either. Hes always around. And our whole friendship is mostly just teasing, roasting, making fun of each other. We do know each others traumas and stuff, but we dont share sad emotional things. Ive never called him crying or anything like that. Were not the type to be emotional with each other. He also does ask to meet up sometimes. But again, I dont know if he means anything by it. Ive read that opposite genders cant be just friends someone will catch feelings at some point. And Im scared maybe thats me. So how do I know? Does he like me? Or am I just reading too much into it? Ive been confused as for some time weve been calling on a daily basis to talk about nothing. Whenever hes bored or feels like talking he rings me up. Does he see me as a friend or does he have feelings?",

    "text": "Location: Florida. Child is okay. Her elbow is bruised and she hit her head but no major injuries. She is now terrified of swimming and the pool. Yesterday we were at swim lessons when the instructor left a wet laminated sheet on the pool deck near the edge where they have the kids get out. My 5 year old calmly got out as instructed and slipped on the sheet and fell backwards and hit her head on the corner of a crate they put items in. The instructor didnt stop lessons, instead told her to see me. The manager didnt offer to call EMS until I requested twice. I looked at security footage and saw that she slipped on what the instructor left out. I filled an incident report and asked for a copy of that and the video. They denied me a copy of the video and the incident report left no mention of the sheet left out. But its clear what the cause of her fall was. EMS came, shes all good. But now is scared of swimming. Its franchised. I called the co-owner who has been equally dismissive. We said we were frustrated with how I had to continue to request they call EMS and she said if mom was so concerned why didnt she call herself? Like its your property and first aid is your responsibility. At this point its the way they handled the situation and the lack of accountability and genuine concern for the safety that bothers me the most. Now my daughter is afraid of swimming. Since there was no hospital visit or severe injuries, is this worth pursuing and what kind of lawyer would handle the case?",

    "title": "I M21 want more time with my gf F21. Am I too clingy?",
    "text": "First of all, english isnt my first language, so pls excuse any mistakes. Me M21 and my gf F21 been in a relationship for 7 months. Its my first relationship ever, but I know, that I can get too clingy when it comes love. I want to be with my partner 24/7. And I really mean it like that. But I still know, that everyone should get some alone time and I agree on that. We are in a mid distance relationship I would say. Because of my job and a bit because of money, we can only see each other once a month. She still lives with her family. The Problem is, I wanna spend more time with her. I am the typ of Person who is always trying to find a way so we can spend more time together. Even if its just an hour. But she isnt like that. She is always saying that she miss me and wish I could just come over. We are both crying so hard everytime we have to say goodbye and still... Whenever I have the opportunitie to come over sooner or stay longer, she gets... distant? One time we wanted to see each other on monday, she was free on the weekend but I had to work. So I asked her, if we could meet on sunday instead. In this way, we could have an extra day and I could just pick her up from the train station since I am working there anyways. She kinda got mad and told me, Monday should be just fine. She asked me, why I would make such a drama when its just one day. That hurt me, because I thought I could do her a favor like that. She was still mad but said she would come on sunday so I would be satisfied. She said her family wouldnt understand that choice and wouldnt be happy about the fact that she is leaving a day earlier but Yeah... She didnt come on sunday anyways because of some other reasons and that was okay. The next time we gonna see each other, we are going on a concert. I have to pick her up 2,5 hours drive then we drive to concert another 2 hours and go back home 1 hour. She has an doctors appointment the day before and I asked her, if I could show up a day earlier. I didnt explain my intensions. I wanted to pick her up, since this appointment is going to take a lot of energy and I just wanted to be there for her, when she isnt well. She has to take the train when I wont pick her up. And by that, I would safe myself atleast 2,5 hours drive. But she got mad again. Told me, it would be senseless. But she also instant added that I should ask her family since it was my idea. I got hurt again, because again, I thought I was doing her a favor and she reacts like that. I ended the topic and whenever she asked me, when I was going to ask, I told her, that she said she didnt want to see me. So I dont see a point in asking her family. I talked about this with her but she got kinda pissed but she still said, she gonna make more time for me. But whenever this happens, she makes me feel guilty. She always says, she is going to do it because I want it and I gonna get mad otherwise. I stopped asking to be honest. It feels like, she only wants to see me on the weekends when we are both free and on vacation. But her family also made it possible for me to spend more time. I was allowed to stay a night longer and go to work from her place. They once even ordered pizza when I actually had to leave, just so I would stay longer. Its not like they dont make time for me. But I really feel hurt whenever she is like that...",

I get anxious whenever I wanna talk to her or join the conversation which is something I dont usually feel, I am actually social so I just have to sufer everyday thinking oh, was that awkward? Oh, my! Does she wanna be my friend?? Am I trying too hard?? Like pleeaaaseee just shut upp! And you know whats the problem? A part of me knows that me and her are actually friends, but we are not close friends. I wish if I can talk to her about our shared interests, but we are at finals now so we cant talk much. Another thing is that I wish she would approach me and start a conversation. Listen she likes and thinks I am a nice person, she hugs good-byes and supports my poetry, but STILL!

    "title": "Im 28F disappointed in the proposal I got from my long term boyfriend 29M",
    "text": "Im 28F really disappointed with the proposal from my long term boyfriend 29M and Im not sure where to go from here. Sorry in advance, its a long read. The whole relationship Ive been very upfront about how important being married is to me and that I didnt want to have kids until we were officially married. Ive never been shy about how Id like a proposal to be special, something that was planned out, and a proclamation of his love for me. Ive also mentioned how very little I like my moms wedding ring set she gave me, because its been through 2 divorces and I dont want to start a marriage with that kind of bad omen. Last year my best friend got pregnant and got married to her long term boyfriend. After she announced she was pregnant my boyfriend flat out told me I want to have kids before Im 30, and if were not going to have kids I need to know now. This spurred a huge blow up fight last October because I reminded him Ive said no less than 20 times over the course of our relationship Im not willing to have kids until were married and he hadnt even proposed 10 years into dating. We ended up breaking up for about two days before he convinced me he would propose before new years and was saving up to buy me a ring so we could start our engagement fresh. New years came and went. I held in hoping he was planning something and told myself Id wait until our 11 year anniversary 1/21. Well I ended up booking a room at a local historic hotel that Ive been dying to stay at since I was a little kid for the weekend after our anniversary 1/25. I booked a ghost tour and a whiskey tasting. After the whiskey tasting we went outside for a smoke and as I went to the ashtray to put out my smoke he said oh wait and got down on one knee next to the ashtray and pulled out my moms ring. It just felt like a total afterthought to the point he admitted he almost forgot to propose. Using a trip I had planned and paid for and the ring I explicitly told him I didnt want. I just feel like he literally couldnt have put less effort into it and it doesnt feel special. Its been over 4 months so I feel like I cant say how much I actually disliked the proposal, and I know hes been under a lot of stress because his sister who basically raised him was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer slightly before our anniversary, and thats taken a huge toll on him. Shes not doing well and has gone downhill fast which has been hard on us both. But I still feel like an afterthought, like he was just placating me so that I wouldnt leave while hes dealing with everything else. I just feel like he proposed out of convenience and obligation and not because its what he wanted to do. Theres no do overs, weve already booked a venue for the wedding next year and all our friends and family have already gotten word of the engagement. Im already planning on just buying myself a cheap but nice ring set so I can at least stop wearing the ring I never wanted and stop feeling so raw about that aspect. Im also currently planning the wedding to be something we would both enjoy and treasure but I cant get over the proposal. How do I get over my feelings on the proposal and move past this so I can stop feeling so disappointed?",

For context this adult resides on land that their parent owns and both benefit from eachothers help. Especially since their parent is 70 or something and needing a lot of help with all types of stuff, constantly, actually excessively and demanding/intrusively from what Ive observed to get to the point. The adult daughter and Mother conflict very tense to where the daughter has had to start making Plans to not involved with the Mother who she said is showing signs of possibly dementia or something, especially since the elderly woman is being very aggressive and almost seems to he harassing and terrorizing her daughter and some others, especially since she is drunk most of the time. The daughter informed me she is deeply disturbed since the Mothers latest anger episode, the Mother was stating how much she hated her daughter and told her adult daughter she had to obtained sexually and explicit images of her daughter and said she was going to release all the private images including pictures of her daughter nud3 and put them in public and on the internet. The daughter is not aware of how/what/why or when her Mother would see or have any access to her undressed or similar, but is concerned about what action she should take to protect herself and her kids and her privacy/body aside from vacating the property and cutting her off. Ive never heard of such a bizarre threat from. Mother. Is that some sort of revenge p.rn crime or other violation? The daughter is concerned about being harassed or blackmailed somehow due to claim that the Mother claimed to obtain and be in possession of images of her daughter undressed. How do you take it and what would you do?",

A few months ago he started showing signs of him showing interest in me and I felt the same way 18 and 16 at the time. this went on for move than half a year but nobody said anything about it as both of us were sort of awkward to bring it up. I turned 19 going into my sophomore year of university and he turned 17 going into senior year of highschool. We decided to give it a go and he is aware about how I sometimes feel awkward about our relationship. His parents do not have an issue with it and are well aware about us, whilst my parents are speculating on it. We have been dating for four months now and he has been treating me so well, better than any person I have talked to romantically, and is smart and very mature about any arguments we have. I forget about my worries when I am with him, but sometimes I still think if this shouldnt be a thing or not.",

But at that speed he had to write me a ticket. I know its a reckless driving. All Im really worried about is my chances of having to go to jail. Im gonna get a lawyer once the weekend is over. What do you think my chances are? Im okay with a fat fine, even license suspension for a while. I just really dont wanna go to jail. Also there was no other cars near when I was speeding.",

Once again there was no law enforcement involvement or damages but the people in the neighborhood were very upset.

    "text": "So I 24M am married to 24M. Im gay and my husband is bi. Weve talked at length about trust/trust issues, past relationships, expectations in our own, etc. My husband has been very clear that he finds any one on one interaction between myself and any male friends cause him discomfort/give him trust issues. Ive never openly voiced any feelings of weirdness towards his own one on one interactions with friends of any gender although it does at times make me paranoid but Im aware thats a me problem. When Ive asked him if me having guy friends makes him uncomfortable hes never outright said yes but says a version of you do you while seeming irritated. Obviously it feels very passive aggressive and Ive since made an effort to avoid making male friends outside of work. My friend group before meeting my husband was all women anyway. This leads me to the question at hand, Im a socially anxious and awkward person. In the past when my male coworkers who I get along with have approached me about hanging out outside of work Im usually able to just give an excuse and say I cant OR if theyre someone I wouldnt hang out with anyway I just say I have a personal rule about not hanging out with coworkers while were still actively working at the same place this is true. Recently the company I work at did a staff reduction and one of the guys I work with who Id consider a work friend was included in the lay off. I have a feeling he wants to ask me for my contact info since weve been working together for some time and definitely seem like friends. Normally Id be like sure no problem but I know it would upset my husband, so what do I say if he asks? I cant really blow him off since Ive given no previous reason for him to believe Id not be his friend and Id feel bad. Ive also told a different friend the truth in the past that my husband wasnt comfortable with me hanging out with them and they ghosted me for a long ass time. Im always honest but maybe I was too honest that time. Help?? ALSO Ive never cheated on or gone behind my husbands back, I wont even look at shirtless guys when they pop up on TV because Im truly only attracted to and love only my husband. He just has trust issues from before meeting me and there was an incident some time ago where I didnt have his back when something came up with his family again socially awkward and froze in the moment so he said I broke his trust when that happened.",

    "text": "Me 20F and my boyfriend 20M have been together for about 2 and a half years. The relationship has been rough, but we love each other and have tried really hard to make it work. One of our biggest fights weve ever had was when he admitted that he had been missing/fantasizing about his ex GF due to our relationship being so bad, and even had retrieved some of her nudes from their old dms she told him that he could keep them. This to me was a massive betrayal and nearly ended the relationship, but I think the magnitude of that situation and seeing how badly it hurt me led him to seek therapy and understand why he felt the need to do these things. He ended the relationship with his ex and theyd been broken up for awhile so even though this destroyed me mentally I knew it was probably a sort of nostalgic coping mechanism of sorts to remember a better time in his life when he was in a good place with his ex rather than a genuine desire to rekindle their relationship as he never reached out. This doesnt make anything he did right, but I decided to forgive him and try to move on with the relationship. He took full accountability and from that point on I had free access to his phone, he was never volatile when I brought it up, and he really did everything he could to earn my trust back. And for the most part he did. I understand how fantasy works and how sometimes the things we find to be turn ons or pleasurable do not always translate to real life, Ive thought about my ex too, but I never took an action like that because of it out of respect for my bf and knowing how hed feel if he found out. Despite the fact I know I could get away with it, thats integrity. But theres one thing about that fight that has really stuck with me: In the heat of it hed told me about a conversation hed had with his friend in the beginning of our relationship where my bf said that his ex was way more out of his league and attractive than me. I am not dumb enough to sit here and ask reddit is that fd up? Because I KNOW it is but I just cant seem to articulate HOW. My bf and I have managed to resolve this issue except for that one thing. He fully admits that its not right he got his exs nudes back or resorted to fantasizing about her to cope with the state of our relationship. But he cant admit that it was messed up to be talking about me that way with his friend. The only reason he apologized for it at all was because it hurt your feelings and he doesnt want to hurt my feelings. But its just true and hes allowed to think shes hotter than me. Sure, whatever, but to go talk about it to your boy like that? Help me guys. I know that was fucked up too but I cant get through to him on it. Ive completely put aside the fact that its just rude and hurtful to compare us AT ALL and why are you even doing that anyway. Obviously its going to trigger my insecurities. All he will concede on is that if I dont want to hear it I shouldnt have to, and he wont mention it to ME but it doesnt make the fact that he believes it or talks to other people about it wrong. Help me figure out a way to get thru to him on this please",

Once she yelled at me in public in frustration because I was asking her smtg relating to groceries it was my first time. she yelled at me in public again when I told her which direction to go to as a casual statement not to direct or tell but something to just bring up. I was just saying it. i would sometimes plan something and ask if shes in, and shed reply rudely, shutting me down and even if I want to pursue that plan by myself I would feel awful. This isnt the case all the time but there are times that make me feel like shit to the point that I just dont ask her mostly and just go ahead with it with other friends or alone. I have other friends who I approach if I have plans, ALL of them, if declining, they decline normally, or politely even or sometimes even suggest an alternative.Im not even the kind of person that pushes you to do something, if you say no, Ill respect your decision. But you can decline normally without being rude. Today I offered to help carry her things with me because I didnt want her to be carrying 2 bags and reasoned with her saying I have more space and she yells at me SO? Problem is idk what to do about it because she is nice sometimes and rude sometimes and I hate being stuck. I feel like Im just being to sensitive but part of me is frustrated. I just wanna know if Im tripping or if this worth crashing out for.",

    "text": "So one of my closest friends 18M got super close with this girl 18F who he came to realise that he had feelings for, however, she has some trauma and so he decided that he actually didnt wanna do anything romantic with her, alongside anything sexual considering that it could make things weird between them. Its been a few months since then and while theyre still decently close platonically theyre not nearly as close as they had been. This is where it gets sticky because I 20M want to pursue her not for a relationship but possibly a fwb situation before she likely goes to another counrtry for universty in a few months. My two main concerns are 1. I dont wanna make my bro feel like I snaked him, especially since I was the only one he opened up to about his feelings for her and this was the first time he had felt like this for a girl, and 2. If we do hookup and dont end up taking things further it could fuck up the group dynamic. Context - were all part of the same friend group, however, hes the one in the group thats closest w/ her. But at the same time, I feel like you cant call dibs on someone indefinitely and you cant really prevent life from taking its course. Were young and were horny, it would be going against our nature to not let things unfold. Do you think i should go forwards with her, or talk to my friend about this and risk making this into a way bigger deal than necessary? TL:DR, my friend got platonically close with a girl, realised he had feelings for her, realised she was a lil bonkers and decdided not to pursue things further. i now wanna explore things w/ her but dont wanna make things weird between me and bro.",

    "title": "Ive 22M have hurt my best friend 20F so much, what am I to do?",
    "text": "I 22M made a terrible mistake, and I feel like Ive ruined the best relationship Ive ever had. My best friend20F, lets call her Amanda and I broke up in February, I was going through some mental health BS that Im still trying to work through. We were talking more, hanging out all the time, and on the verge of getting back together for a while, and shes truly been my person. Weve talked about the future, Ive met her wonderful mother, and shes supported me through so much. Shes the most incredible human being Ive ever been blessed enough to know. Her compassion and kindness for others is truly limitless, and I look up to her in so many ways. When her and I were broken up, I made selfish choices that betrayed her trust and deeply hurt her. I went to visit my ex, and I wasnt honest about something that couldve severely impacted her health, and it has broken her trust completely, reasonably so. Shes been angry, heartbroken, and she has every right to be. Shes called me some brutal things, like scum, garbage, a piece of shit and as much as it hurt to hear, I honestly agree. I hate myself for what I did, the shame and regret for my actions feels so consuming if that makes any sense, I cant go five minutes without remembering how much Ive hurt her. We talked on the phone last night for about four hours. The first half was just her yelling at me, venting her hurt and betrayal. The second half, we were starting to talk ok, I told her how much I love her, how I recognize all the small and beautiful things about her that made me fall so hard, and apologized as much as I think I could. I have told her im dedicated completely and totally to ensuring I never make such a stupid and impactful mistake ever again, and Im 100 dead set on being the kind of person she deserves, or as much as I can, I could never treat her as well as someone as perfect as her deserves. Now, any silence from her feels absolutely devastating. When I text or call, and dont get a response, its shattering, all I want to do is try ti fix things, and send her flowers and shower her with compliments and tell her how wonderful she is in every conceivable aspect, but i cant, and its tearing me up. Im not seeing a therapist until next week my old one just quit and Im really struggling in the meantime. I feel so lost, sick, ashamed, and hopeless. I miss her more than I can put into words, and I dont know how to keep moving forward when the thing I destroyed was the one thing that gave me peace. I just want to be better for her, and I want the chance to remedy my greatest mistake. I feel like Im drowning, if anyone has advice on how to cope with this kind of guilt, or how to even begin earning forgiveness, any help would be greatly appreciated.",

I mean, cigarettes are unhealthy because of the chemicals inside of the filter and whatnot, right? the pure plant itself shouldnt be unhealthy, besides for nicotine? Im trying to get this question answered but my online research only points me towards cigarettes, which isnt my question. Im making my own cig with clove leaves and tobacco, and i feel like that should be the healthiest alternative, no? Im just confused, schooling as a child i was raised when D.A.R.E was still a thing in the US, never told me why TOBACCO was bad, only cigarettes. If someone could explain this to me, and help me understand clearly what the health risks are, i would really appreciate it!",

    "text": "So in a recent post, I mentioned that my wife sometimes loves skipping the slow build-up and diving right indeep kisses, hands down the pants, and were off. It made me realize that while we love that intensity, we tend to stick with just two positions: missionary and cowgirl. Theyre both great for staying closelots of skin, eye contact, and connection, which she loves, even when its fast and needy. But Ive been thinking about switching things up a bitexploring more rear entry positions that still let us stay really close and feel that same intimacy. The one that keeps coming to mind is prone bone. Id love to flip her over, run my hands slowly over her back, kiss her spine, maybe drizzle a bit of warm oil and massage it in. Then Id pull her panties down, tease her a bit with some slow grinding and breath on her neck, and ease into her from behind, bodies fully pressed together. It feels like the perfect mix of hot and connected. But I know theres more out there. So Im throwing it out to the communitywhat are your favorite rear entry positions that still feel physically intimate? Ones that let you stay close, touch a lot, maybe whisper in their ear, kiss their neck, that kind of thing? Open to suggestions, variations, or tips youve tried that made rear entry feel less detached and more like a full-body experience.",

    "text": "I met a girl at a festival and we hooked up. I think shes pretty cool. We live a few states apart from each other. I live alone with my dog in a home I own. She lives with her parents. One has dementia and she is their caretaker when she isnt working which takes up most of her time. Her father doesnt help. Shes the youngest of many siblings that also dont help. In exchange for being the caretaker the dad lets her stay there for free. She wants to go back to school and I want her to move on and prioritize her happiness and she cant do those things with her current situation. I think it would be completely insane to offer to let her stay at my place when we just met last week. At the same time I want to extend the offer anyway because it may be her best option and like I said I want whats best for her. She has a transferable job and could find work easily and therefore could afford an apartment later if living here doesnt work out. Should I tell her Id be okay with that if its what she wanted? I dont want to scare her away since moving in so insanely soon after meeting someone isnt an offer that would normally be received as a simple kind gesture. I would be okay with it for now because I got along with her better than I do most people and Im truly aware of the different risks and I think theyre manageable. What would you do?",

I did not insert myself in his marriage. I have been understanding of him remaining married as his wife is a nut job. Also he has a friend that she is they type to disrespect relationships and boundaries. She has done it before to me and several others I know. I told him that I am not okay with their friendship or them talkkng he swears they dont talk that often. But I honestly have the sickening feeling they talk more than what he lets on. I feel disrespected and I have told him. But of course somehow I got made into be over reacting.

    "text": "Hi all. Im a 31 year old woman who has dated three men in my life. As I approach my 32nd birthday, I decided to take stock of my love life and dating history. I noticed that in all three cases, each ex ended up settling down/marrying/having kids with the woman they dated immediately after me. I am very much over these exes and this exercise has purely been for my self-improvement and to learn more about myself in relationships. Thinking about how I can be a better partner in the future and maybe where Ive gone wrong in the past. This little trend has given me pause. In all three cases, I ended it because it wasnt going anywhere. The first guy was a situationship without the sex. The second was a situationship with the sex. The third was dating for six months but fizzling out before becoming official. Its a bit jarring and upsetting that I wasnt good enough for commitment and then right after, they settled down. I know this can happen. But for it to have happened three times is off-putting. What do you make of this? TLDR : 31F late bloomer whose exes all settled down after our relationship ended.",

    "text": "Tenant Seeking Advice on Small Claims Suit Against Former Landlord I was a tenant who had a signed purchase agreement for a condo, but the sale fell through on closing day due to the HOA being non-warrantable. I ended up renting the unit instead to avoid homelessness. Later, the landlord requested I vacate by the end of April, and I complied. I withheld April rent due to unsafe balcony construction that wasnt addressed. After moving out, I received no written notice about my 500 security deposit. Instead, the landlord emailed me post-eviction judgment where the court ruled in my favor demanding rent and claiming the deposit would be deducted. No deductions notice was given within 30 days. I filed a small claims suit citing: 1. Contempt of court for attempting to collect rent after a take nothing judgment. 2. Bad-faith withholding of the deposit. 3. Negligent misrepresentation in the failed condo sale. 4. Mental anguish due to the entire ordeal. Im seeking over 6,000 in damages including treble damages under Texas Property Code and DTPA, plus sanctions. Looking for insights Location: Texas",

    "text": "my partner and i have been dating for a couple months, but i think have an issue of being academically insecure. we both work hard, however he goes to a prestigious university and i go to community college. i dont hate him for it but i also cant help but feel incompetent next to him. recently we were talking about me transferring. i dont plan to do so until a year later so i dont know which school i will be able to go to. to give more context, he knows my dream school is the school he goes to which is known to be very academically rigorous and has a selective acceptance rate he was not a deciding factor in this i said i was afraid that when i transferred, i wouldnt be able to catch up to people because i had gone to community college. he went on to talk about how i shouldnt pressure myself to go to my dream school, and that it could be a blessing in disguise if i got into other schools i was applying to. he also talked about how at these other schools academics would be easier and thus it might be a blessing in disguise because i would be at my skill level. i was pretty confused so he said that what he meant was that all of these schools are great so i shouldnt apply so much pressure to go to my dream school. i was pretty upset but didnt show it. i know he means well and i know that it doesnt really matter what school you go to. i just feel like the wording of blessing in disguise made me really spiral it sounded to me like he was trying to say that it was the best thing for me. i also want to add i am guaranteed admission to these schools because of certain programs so it felt like he was asking me to settle. these kinds of situations happen all the time. he will make a very small remark about how something and i will spiral but i wont show it. i also realize i can be very delusional. honestly i am not very smart and i know i aim a little higher than i should, but i still think i try really hard. i feel like i want reassurance but everything he says feels like a lie. i know that in order to feel someone elses support i have to believe in myself first, but i cant help but need to feel like he believes in me. tldr now i just feel stupid, i feel like he thinks im stupid even though i know thats not what he meant, and it just impacts me whenever i do anything. how can i help myself?",

    "title": "Aggravated assault question",
    "text": "Location: TN Hello, I was in an abusive relationship with my ex for a year. Ive learned I was Trauma bonded and stayed too long, and shouldve reported him the first time he assaulted me and I had bruises last year in May. But I loved him and didnt think it would get worse before it got better. Well last month, we got into an argument and he forced me to come to his place said that if I didnt come to him he would come to me and beat me up and id get kicked out so I went and he assaulted me slapping me, kicking me that night. The next morning we got into it again because I found womens underwear in his trash and he assaulted me with a gun on my head and pointed it at me and made me eat dog food since I act like a dog and do degrading things with the underwear. I was shocked and crying and he made me feel like it was my fault all that happened and comforted me and we had sex and I left. I didnt report him that day. A few days later with no concern or remorse from him and head pain, I went to the hospital to check they did a CT with contrast scan and said I was okay. But I decided then to press charges so I went and did that in his state of TN, I dont live in TN but it happened at his house there. Afterwards I felt guilty bc since I kept talking about what happened he all of a sudden said he didnt remember it and started to say he went to a mental health facility and has anti social personality disorder. Well the warrant was issued and he called me and I tipped him off that he had a warrant bc I was surprised he could call, well then he threatened me that if he goes to jail I will too bc of a video he recorded of me late last year accusing me of sexual assault he takes sleep meds, but we still had sex that he said he kept just in case I ever went to police on him. He made me send a text saying I raped him and forced me to pay him money since late last year. When he found out he had a warrant he immediately lawyered up and after I refused to recant my statement he said he would file charges and stopped talked to me the day before he turned himself in. Well a random person called me saying her friend is dating him and found out my name and wants to warn her friend, I told her about the gun but nothing else, but I did say how I felt guilty for pressing charges and didnt know it would go this far. She said he had an ankle monitor and was telling the woman hes been dating as the same time as me that he hadnt talked to me in 5 years, Im crazy Im stalking him he has messages of me repeatedly asking to talk to him a few days after the incident, so he deleted his thread and only has mine and that I have a condition which I do but was diagnosed years ago with BPD he told her hes gonna get off bc he said I followed him to his house and started the whole thing. I only submitted pics of bruises and a text of him threatening to go after my family a few days after the incident bc I said I wanted to leave him. The stranger girl texted me again today and told me I have so many ppl supporting me and dont be afraid, but Im worrying its a plant by him to throw me off bc its just too ironic and the girl got mad when I didnt want to tell her everything that happened to me.",

Have court in a few days. Only issue, both of us dont live here and were only visiting. Police said it can go either way. Temporary judge said it can go either way.

    "title": "I 23F found out my boyfriend 26M kissed his close friend and hid it from me even after I became friends with her. How do I rebuild trust after an omission like this?",
    "text": "I 23F have been dating my boyfriend 26M for a couple of months now and he has a close female friend they know each other for around four years. Even before we started dating I suspected they had something going on bc he traveled specifically to where she live and they posted pics on the same places in one post especifically he was calling her beautiful but since at the time he and I were just at the talking stage I tried to ignore it even tho it was making me uncomfortable bc I was already having feelings for him and he knew about it. Some months goes by, we started dating and I became really close to this girl and I noticed he seemed pretty uncomfortable about it, which made me suspicious about why would my friendship with her would bother him so I asked directly if anything had ever happened between them. Thats when he admitted they kissed once during a group trip but for some reason only the two of them stayed in an airbnb alone, he said they were drinking and ended up kissing, but it didnt go further... according to him she was the one who said it was best not to pursue anything romantic because they were such close friends and that she had just broken up with her bf at the time her ex was really jealous about her friendship with my bf at the time and made her block him from all socials but I dont blame him bc as soon as she got single, they hooked up so.. but anyways he insists theyve only been friends ever since and not only that, today I found out that they have an account on Hbo together ngl this really made me upset. The issue here is that he hid this from me even when he noticed that I became close to her. I only found out because I confronted him directly, he said he didnt tell me because he thought Id feel weird or uncomfortable and didnt want to change how I saw her but hiding this only made it worse. I also asked her about it directly and she was honest about it, her story matched his and she was supportive of me bringing it up. Now, this wouldnt bother me as much if it were an isolated situation but its not. There have been other situations involving women, one of the biggest was early in our relationship when he suggested the idea of a threesome involving my best friend. At the time I didnt even know how to respond bc it made me incredibly uncomfortable and while I tried to brush it off, it stuck with me and added to my insecurity. There have been other moments too like when he seemed to get weirdly jealous over guys flirting with this female friend or when I noticed him acting differently around her more invested, more reactive. Its hard not to feel like theres some lingering feeling or unresolved tension there, Im starting to feel like theres a pattern, he downplays things until I dig them up and Im tired of having to discover things he should have been upfront about, this is not about control or jealousy, its about transparency, especially when it involves people in my life now too. I feel like these things are piling up and I dont know how to feel secure or rebuild trust. I forgot to mention but this is his first relationship",

    "text": "This is all out of curiosity or anyone who can relate. My partner 21M and I 21F, broke things off due to a situation where he lied, gaslit me, and made me feel crazy over something so little and stupid. I broke things off not because of the situation, but because of how he reacted and handled it when I brought it to light. He was shattered. I am my partners first long term gf, we have been together for 4 years, and his personality say is very reactive, defensive and he has an anxious attachment style in our relationship. He would do anything in my eyes that is not the right way to keep me. After a week I asked to reconnect and talk through the situation, how It made me feel and why I felt so betrayed. The following week I noticed he had sent 4 woman from his main Instagram account to his private instagram account only 3 days after I broke things off. Woman of his type. I know that he gets to know who hes interested in through his private account, same as me. When I asked about this he was very ashamed, explaining he was feeling lost, was looking for someone to fill the hole. Anyway I was upset at the thought he was replacing me immediately, but eventually moved on. I still think about this sometimes, not hurt, not resentfully but curious. I would never do this, I would never think of moving on so quick. I guess Im asking for outsiders experience, maybe from the person who did go searching immediately after the breakup, why did you do it?",
