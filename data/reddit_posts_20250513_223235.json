    "title": "My bf M30 is upset at me M20 because I lie so often",
    "text": "My boyfriend M30 and I M20 recently had arguments about him finding out that I had been watching prn in the relationship. I previously had told him I used to not watch it but after so many disagreements and frustrations that we had in our relationship I turned to that. After my bf found it on my phone, he was mainly upset because I had previously told him I never did and I had made it seem like I was upset when he told him he had. Then he found an account that I had online and he was really upset. I told him sorry and I explained my reasoning on why I did it and I told him that I would try to limit it and really try to be more engaged in our relationship. Fast forward to now, we said we work on it on building trust but we never really talked about it. I think he assumed that it was my responsibility to figure it out but I wasnt sure how to if I didnt exactly know what he wanted. Earlier today, we went on a walk and a guy who was seemingly fit and attractive walked by us. My boyfriend was standing in front and I was walking behind him and I honestly was checking him out. I was wondering if he was gay, thinking about how I wish I looked like him and honestly thinking that he was attractive. My boyfriend asked me after I accidentally stepped on his shoe if I was looking at him and I said no not really I was looking at his outfit. I said it because I didnt want to make him feel insecure if I said yes, but then he said it was a test of some sort to see if I would lie. For me, white lying has been a norm for me and maybe a defense mechanism to avoid disappointment and confrontation but its not doing too well for me. My bf and I disagree so often that I thought that it would be better to lie. He said that he was upset and disappointed and said that he knows its normal in a way to check out other people but was upset that I lied about it. I cant seem to stop lying and I dont really know if this is going to work out if trust has been broken amongst the other issues we have. Weve talked about it, and its just hard to communicate. TLDR: Lost trust in relationship due to lying. Relationship has already been rocky due to mismatch communication style. What now?",

    "text": "I need some advice. I am an avid gymmer, someone who loves to wake up early whilst always keeping the hustle up. Additionally, I fell in love with my partner 21F because she was smart, and I was smart. I was smart enough to know that i would never pick a partner for looks but how smart she is. However, she has been constantly degrading at my life goals and doesent want to support my cause. The problem? Its rooted in something society has normalized fattening your partner up on purpose. Although crazy, it is much too normalized for a significant other to deliberately increase calorie counts in meals to fatten the other partner up. I have told my partner numerous times about my gym orientation. However, she chooses to ignore me completely and will do things to make sure I gain weight. She will force me to drive to succumb to her cravings, but then not order anything when I dont order anything at extremely high calorie places like Crumbl. She will unplug my PC and make it harder for me to work. I feel like she hates when I succeed. She hates when Im applying or trying at my computer to study work. She hates when I try to eat healthy and cut down calories. And honestly, it seems so awful to hear, but she pulls it off so slyly every single day, that I dont even see it. Now, as I write this, I can finally see the scope of what is happening. Why did I say this was normalized? Well, there are numerous incidents of a husband who gains lots of weight after joining a relationship. Its a very normalized trend, and I feel like my girlfriend is just following those footsteps. My next course of action is to speak with her about this. If it doesent work, and she doesent stop, I will leave. What are your guys thoughts on this? thanks.",

    "text": "I work in a shop of maybe 10-12 people. Were all poor as fuck and theres not enough managers so we all keep coming in sick Yes we shouldnt, yes it sucks, yes were all just too poor to miss work, were working on it Originally I assumed it was just flu season but now... Im not so sure. The cycle has been the same every time, one person is finally coming off the sickness, has a minor cough left over, next person has the sniffles. At first they assume its the cold, then its a sore throat, chest pains, and then a cough that doesnt go away quickly. Theres been a few other smaller effects that differ from person to person, but those are always the same. I myself have caught it four times now, and I have asthma so it always sucks, but everytime Ive caught it, its always slightly worse and lasts slightly longer than last, and its the same story for everyone else. So I guess Im wondering, are we slowly breeding a super virus that will wipe out humanity or will we eventually be able to kill the virus ourselves?",

    "title": "Boyfriend 20M is emotionless after I 21F Call him out",
    "text": "Hello, Ive been dating my Boyfriend 20M for 1 year now, Im 21F and Yesterday I called him out for not being able to do the Bare Minimum. I was in a call with him on Sunday night studying for a big Calculus exam the following day and I stayed up late past my usual time so Im exhausted, during the call he tells me how He will plan the day for us on Monday after my exam so I can relax and Im excited because he never plans anything. After my studying I go to sleep with expectations so Im super happy, I wake up in the morning and drive my little brother to school then drive to my Boyfriends house to pick him up since we have class at the same time he also doesnt have a Car or License and when I pick him up I ask excitedly Good Morning love, what are the plans for today? His response was I dont know, Nothing really just wanna nap after class?. When I tell you my heart dropped and anger rose it wasnt funny, I usually dont care about things like this since Im usually laid back but I had expectations, we never do anything and when plans usually are made Im the one planning because he cant think of anything most the time. I just responded like oh and drove to school in silence. After my exam he was waiting for me outside my class like usual and asked how it went it went fairly well and we started driving back to his place, on the way there he asked if I was hungry and I responded Im hungry but not super much at the same time so Id be down to snack on something later and he replies okay, we can eat later, this alone had me thinking we were just gonna be at his house the whole day since the past couple times Ive been over weve made food at his house which I dont mind especially since hes been on a diet, but I was being somewhat emotionally immature since Im still a bit mad he didnt make plans after getting me excited the day before. We took a nap as soon as we got to his house and I woke up to a message from a group chat with my girlfriends that they want to eat Korean Barbecue, and with the way things were going with me and my boyfriend I decided to go eat out with them. When my boyfriend finally woke up from our nap I told him I was going to eat out with my friends and his response was wait so youre going out to eat? I guess Im not gonna eat today at all and I look at him like huh??? He then says, yeah I was gonna have us eat out somewhere but I guess not anymore if youre going out to eat and my blood boiled, because he never mentioned we were going out to eat and I really assumed we werent going out to eat since hes been on a Diet recently. I just gave him a blank stare and apologized but inside I was just mad at the moment. I was gonna leave in about 2 hours for the dinner with my girlfriends, at that point my boyfriend looks at me and asks me so what are we gonna do before you go out?. I was over it. I didnt want to make choices or plans that day, and then he just goes and asks me that so I just tell him what happened to our plans you were supposed to make? Why didnt you plan something? And he just stared at me emotionless and gave the excuse that he didnt feel well and that we dont have many hobbies implying were both boring people and that its not easy. In my head I just had thoughts running, we dont need hobbies to plan a date, we can literally try new things, heck if we went to the park I would have been happy but he couldnt plan a single thing??? I just pull out a game we bought from target and we played that before I left, he was going out with his friends too to play volleyball at the park. Fast forward a couple hours later after we both hangout with our friends he invited me to come back to his house and I agree hoping he had seen the mood I was in before leaving his house but nope, I was wrong. I get to his room and he immediately goes so what you wanna do? I just let it slide and suggest we play games so we play Roblox for a bit, but then we got bored and so I tried talking to him about taking the lead more in the relationship and he just seems not interested so I ask a dumb question, Am I a Bad Girlfriend? And he got so mad and annoyed because I ask this question whenever he seems not interested in our conversation, he just raises his voice slightly in an angered annoyed way and tells me thats such a broad question I wouldnt even know what a bad girlfriend is. So I just stay quiet as he puts on a movie. I lay down next to him and he is just flat out ignoring me, not seeming interested so I start gathering my things and leave his room teary eyed and hes freaking out, I will say that me storming off probably wasnt the right move but what can I do when he cant take the hint that Im sort of mad/sad that he cant take the initiative even after trying to communicate with him? I go to my car and hes just staring at me blankly the whole time, as Im backing out the drive way I roll my window down and say goodnight and he does to, but I drive back in because I start bursting into tears, I didnt want the night to end like this and I run out my car and hug him apologizing and telling him that I expected more from him and he just says, Im the one thats sorry, I fucked up as your boyfriend and should have known better I try telling him its not his fault I expected more I just felt like an awful person at the moment but then he proceeded to just give me that blank stare with no tears or anything and me being me still expecting something I go in for a kiss and he pulls away then saying are you trying to kiss me? And I step back in disbelief so I ask him can I kiss you? And he just gives me a peck on the lips not even walking me back to my car or hugging me, nothing. Just a Goodnight and very low/soft I love you as Im walking back to my car. I will say as he started walking back into his house I broke down in tears in my car because like, what kind of situation was that? Am I imagining things or will I not be able to get my point across? Maybe Im the super immature person in my relationship. I feel like I needed to get this out and have no one to get advice from. Sorry for the way I type its my second time using this platform and Im not always on it.",
