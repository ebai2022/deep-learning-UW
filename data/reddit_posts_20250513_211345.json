    "text": "Ive always had weird thoughts and feelings, but Ive been able to suppress them lately because Im an adult now and dont really have time to myself to really sit around and just think. Growing up, Ive done things Im not very proud of. I attempted to poison my sibling over something very simple, Ive hurt animals, cats dogs insects whatever, for no reason at all, or because I was feeling upset. When my youngest sibling was born, I would have thoughts about getting rid of her. I wish I was trying to be an edgy teen, pretending, but I wasnt, and Im not. Of course, now and then I very much knew my actions were unacceptable, and wrong, and not normal, but I couldnt help them. Im over 20 now, and Im seeing these habits slipping into my life and relationship even. I thought it was something I would grow out of, but honestly, they never left, Ive just gotten better at suppressing them. I hate to admit it, but even up until recently Ive had moment where I would abuse. Its not something Im proud of at all, I hate myself for it so much, but its something that takes over me in the moment. I want to know what can be an explanation for this. I know I need to see a professional for this, but the one time I tried, they completely brushed it off. It might have been due to my age. Maybe if I were to seek help now it would go better. But I hate admitting these things, I feel awful just writing this out. But i know I need help. Im very anti social as well. For a while i thought i had some form of autism, not understanding certain social cues or how to make friends or how to have a normal conversation and be truly empathetic, not just an act. It seems with certain situations i always go with my generic response i have made for myself to use, and i hate it. It makes me feel stupid. But I dont know how else to do it or respond.",
