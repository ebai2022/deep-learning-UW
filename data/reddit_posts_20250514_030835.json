    "text": "About seven months ago I met my friend, well call her Mia, through work. Mia and I realized we had similar interests and hit it off. I can be pretty closed off but shes offered me so much encouragement when life gets rough, and weve become so close that coworkers mistakenly thought we were childhood friends. I can honestly say shes one of the people I feel most comfortable around. Early on in this friendship she told me she was married to a guy Ill call Caleb. The first time we went out to get dinner together Mia wouldnt stop checking her phone. Turns out, Caleb was guilt tripping her for going out without him and was getting angry at her for staying out so late. I noticed this was a trend. He would downplay her contributions to their relationship, make fun of the things she enjoyed, and get angry at her for going out with friends. Twice he invited himself to hang outs he wasnt interested in that ended in him getting angry at her because he didnt enjoy himself and felt left out. And, mind you, she would dote on him any time he came to something with her. I was worried about their relationship and told her so. In response, Mia actually took my concern to heart and started looking into divorce. But after he cried upon discovering what she was considering, she decided to stay with him and started ghosting me. Later she told me she was afraid I would be disappointed in her for staying with him. I made it clear that it was her decision to make, not mine, and that I wasnt disappointed in her. This salvaged our relationship, and we became close again. She would still tell me about all the things he would do that made her feel insecure, and she would still tell me she wanted to leave him, but she said that it was just how life is and that she felt obligated to do whatever she could to make their relationship work. When I would tell her that she deserved to be happy in her relationship she would deny it. Then, just recently, my birthday came along. Mia and I planned a huge picnic to celebrate. And then her husband told her she wasnt allowed to go. Turns out, Caleb dislikes me because he thinks I have romantic feelings for Mia untrue although Mia admitted to having romantic feelings for me very early on in our friendship which she swears he knew nothing about. I thought Mia might fight back on Calebs decision because its my birthday, but instead she cancelled our plans and told me shed rather do something small, like go book shopping after work, instead. She also told me that if Caleb asks her to stop being my friend then shed have to stop seeing me for a while, but she knew Id understand. I dont know how to tell her how much this conditional friendship hurts me. I also feel selfish for putting my feelings first here. I mean, shes clearly in a difficult relationship. I want to support her through it. But with her previous instances of pushing me away and now with this, its hard to feel like Im important to her. Is there any way for me to salvage this relationship from here?",

So theres this sociopath serious one whom me and my friend Mary used to be friends with. We cut off and went no contact with the sociopath his name is Mark, 5 years ago. Background on Mark: He was at first cool. We both thought he was our friend. But turns out it was all glib and superficial. Hes a high functioning alcoholic, abused his now ex wife and kids, narcissistic traits, does drugs and has no job. He became toxic to Mary and I. He would put us down, use us for money, manipulate us, lack empathy, show up late or not at all. Lies, OMFG the lies, gaslight us. Deception and showed no remorse. He canceled plans, show up late or not at all. In and out of jail. But he would miraculous pop back up into our lives. We found out through mutual friends he burned down his ex wives and a few of our friends house. He got a hold on Mary after I told her not to continue communication with him but she insisted. She asked him how would he like it if someone burned his house. Mark said he didnt care. So Mary BURNS down his house! Recommendations on how to keep Mark away or how to stay away from him? Lets say Mark truly didnt care about his house being burned down, do you think it was right for Mary to burn his house down? Have you dealt with any sociopaths at all? Tell me your story. What should they do? Weve tried the police and moving homes but to no avail.",

    "text": "Hi. I am a 33 year old female that is friends with a 24 year old transwoman person Male transitioning to Female. She would tell me that she is angry and sad that she hates her genitalia and she does not want to not exist anymore because she wasnt born as a cis female and she is envious, suici and depressed because of that. Anyway We have been talking over fb messenger and phone for 2 years i am worried because she would tell me that she feels worthless and inadequate as a security guard but a few days ago when we met in person, she showed around her apartment. She had a crown victoria with a push bar, a spotlight and a computer stand inside, on the bumper she had a thin blue line us flag sticker, and another black background thin blue line sticker next to a transgender flag on the right with a pink sheriff-like star on the trans flag decal. Her toyota camry had lights on the visor that lit up blue and white. She had a thin blue line windshield sunshade, in her trunk she had several dark blue winter cop looking like coats, she had a plate carrier that she called it an active shooter vest with a blue line patch on it, another bulletproof vest with buttons and a Security Patrol Officer badge on it. She had yellow Caution tape, a duffle bag on the passenger front seat with a pen holder a first aid kit, clipboard and folders inside of it. She even had traffic cones in her trunk. Fast forward to her apartment, on her balcony hangs a thin blue line us flag next to a transgender flag with the same style pink star sticker in the middle of it. In her living room She showed me an actual cop taser, several pepper spray canisters, several pairs of duty boots several pairs of handcuffs, batons, a cop flashlight, gloves, she even had riot nightsticks, she had over a dozen duty belts of different styles. There were several white Shieldbox boxes stacked on top of each other in the living room. She showed me her G-Shock tactical watches and then showed me a collection of toy police cars and all of her radios. When I told her that she had a lot of walkie talkies, she got upset and told me oh these arent walkie talkies, theyre police radios, get it right she then felt the need to tell me that nothing she has has the wording police on it. She had a lot of thin blue line bracelets, even a paracord one with a customized light pink buckle. When she showed me her closet which had a great amount of womens clothes that fit her well on one side. On the other side on hangers she had SO MANY like dark blue pants with different shades of blue stripes going down the sides. She had a lot of solid dark blue, khaki, green, other color uniform pants and 5.11s She had several dark navy blue polos. A LOT of thin blue line tee shirts. She showed me her Florida Deputy Sheriff uniform pants and button up shirt next to it without any patches. She showed me her California Highway Patrol outfit which were the pants and the tan shirt. She even had a border patrol uniform shirt as she called it without any patches on it. She also had a bike patrol outfit the shirt and the shorts next to each other on hangers. She also keeps and hangs up previous security guard company uniform shirts that she used to work for and no longer works for them. When we were talking about what she would look pretty in and what feminine outfit would go best with each other, she told me that she eventually wants to present as fem but for now she doesnt think she passes yet so when she goes out in public, for her safety and protection she wears tactical boots, 5.11 pants or uniform dark blue pants and a dark blue uniform style polo so that the first thing people will question if she is an officer or some sort of law enforcement and not go straight to and attack her or discriminate on her looking trans. They know best not to mess with me. She walked over to her room and showed me a Cowboy sheriff hat a trooper hat and like a dark blue NYPD combination duty hat without the badge. There were containers and totes which had more gear and like pouches, more flaslights and stuff. There were more duty belts in a cardboard box with more pouches She showed me her interior bulletproof vest and then some strobe thing called GA light and it flashes blue and white on one side and solid bright white on the other side. She called it her shoulder light and then showed me her police radios most of which were Harris or Motorola she then showed me her guest bedroom which had patches on the wall pinned with thumbtacks of several law enforcement agencies. She showed me her Scanner division and explained to me what the difference is between a radio scanner and a police radio is before showing me her walkie talkies which were mostly motorola and some others like Kenwood, baofeng, etc. She showed me Marine radios she said could mess around on and do radio checks to the coast guard with and also has an Airband transciever she could use to mess with aircraft. She showed me a motorola walkie talkie that she programmed herself and used from when she used to be a security guard at the mall whuch she can still listen to and then an iCom walkie talkie radio that she loves to listen to different programmed frequencies on and then went on about this DMR jargon and what dmr radios are. Shes got an AR under her bed and 2 handguns on top of her nightstand next to her bed within reach of her. After showing me all of these things she called herself an enthusiast and that she sometimes gets bored and imitates the hand movements, quotes and what officers say and act like them off the of police bodycam video channels that she watches a lot of on YouTube and also old COPS episodes. She abruptly had to use the bathroom and I took the opportunity to get my phone out and record everything that she showed me in her apartment in case something wierd or bad came up later. The main reason I recorded without her knowing and I had enough time is because In case i should eventually go show my local police department so that they are aware that she has all of these things. When she came out of the bathroom, She told me that there is a fine line that she will never cross and that shes seen police impersonators on YouTube and kept saying that she likes watching and getting a kick out of the whole Jeremy Dewitte serial impersonator youtube videos. She then made a joke out of it saying that she would be the first transwoman ever to get arrested for impersonating a police officer but laughed it off saying Just kidding, its a very embarrassing charge to have and people will see me as a wierdo and thats a guarantee that I will never get friends for sure that way. I agreed with her as that gave me a little bit of relief but I still worry. I asked her why she doesnt just go to the academy and become a police officer. She said that she already knows that she would fail 1 or 2 of the tests, the psychological evaluation and or the physical fitness portion of the test and that she will stay powerless and miserable as a Security guard. She said that she is lonely and Im her only friend so far and that nobody wants to be her friend and that shes feels very lonely and sad and S---idal a lot of the time. She does own an AR type rifle and 2 handguns as far as I know right by her bed. That has got to be probably the most concerning. My question is should I distance her slowly and run away fast and stop our friendship or should I trust her word that shes aware and that she said shes not doing any wierd shit that I dont know about?? I want yalls take on this. Is this just some police gear fetish that she has or is she on some wierd shit? Ive posted and asked other subreddits for a better perspective but most responses Ive gotten from people are really really Mixed so I am still trying to get more perspectives before I make my final decision on whether Im going to ghost her immediately, distance myself slowly but only talk to her over the phone, or still support her no matter what. Some people say its her special interes and her diagnosed ASD. Others have said that I need to stop talking to her immediately and run away. Id rather be safe but Im wondering if I should trust her word like she wants me to. She obviously struggles with not being happy or enough but ive never came across this before its wierd. What is your analysis of her?",

Eventually it kept coming back and I went to my primary care doctor to ask her. She diagnosed me with BPPV Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and sent me to physical therapy which did help me a bit and my dizziness went away for a few weeks. Now its back and I feel like Im going crazy. I dont know whats causing it. If its just anxiety or something worse. I feel paranoid because i stopped taking my depression and anxiety medication two years ago without my psychiatrists knowledgeLexapro and Wellbutrin and I am scared that I messed up my brain or something. But why would I be experiencing issues from stopping the medication two years later? It just doesnt make sense. Please help.",

    "text": "so i applied to a company through their own website and was able to get an interview. i get a call back saying the interview went great and theyd love to have me come back for a tour of the place. they also said that theyd be wanting me to join the company through a temp agency and see how things go. its a difficult place to get into and they dont just hire anyone off of the street. i dont necessarily have a problem with that but what i do have a problem with is that i wont be getting any of the benefits and a pay decrease of 5 an hour from what i asked for initially for at least three months. how should i bring this up at the next interview? im not looking to leave a stable job for a maybe well hire you full time later on. its just odd to me that they want me going through a temp agency instead of directly hiring me, i just feel insulted by that. any and all advice is appreciated!",
