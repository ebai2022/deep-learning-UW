    "text": "None of my family uses social media to post or reveal any private information. We only have gamer usernames/alias and its completely irrelevant to our private information. I have no idea what my brother is doing, but someone doxxed him and found our dads name and my name and have one photo of me that is only from my work place. Im confused to how this is possible or what else they know since the only reason they have a photo of me is through work. It makes me uneasy that they know what I look like and they threatened my brother to kidnap me. I would like to call the police but a family member says my brother is also doing sketchy things and that would get him in trouble too. Im worried for my familys safety.",

    "text": "He knows if he doesnt or cant that I will. And as resentful as I am is as clueless as I am to as how I should handle this. For context I just moved in with the guy but the old roommate the one whose original lease it is warned me about the fact that hes kind of a bum. Dude has 2 kids that he doesnt pay child- support for. Like, the mom figured it was more easy to just completely let him off the hook than it would have been to try and get a check out of him each month. Which is actually really sad. Its been a bunch of little things here and there him smoking the roaches of the weed I bought and not asking me to come join him waiting for me to leave to eat more of my food than he knows id be okay with him just straight drinking all the soda I bought after I told him dont be an asshole about it. Its little things here and there and Ill say something about it the moment however this weekend will probably be different because he has his kids over. And his sixteen year old brother. Already this man doesnt eat unless Im feeding him. Hes kind of been alluding to wanting me to get pancake mix for him all week so he can have a fun breakfast with them or something. I just dont know what to do. Helping him has eaten a hole in my pocket faster than i was planning. I also dont want to bring it up with him before something was to happen just in case he really is going to go and get enough food for his family. The problem is I have a fridge full of food for myself that I bought and that seems to just be grounds for him to not get anything for himself so far at least. What do I do?",

    "text": "Hi all, I 28F have a close online friendship with a guy 29M thats been ongoing for a little less than a year. We talk almost daily through texts, voice chats, and video calls. Weve never met in person, but theres a strong bond between us. Over time, our dynamic has included more of what Id describe as romantic playfulness, things like light teasing, playful flirting, joking about being a couple, or sweet comments that toe the line between platonic and something more. Its all pretty light-hearted, but it has become more frequent recently. Im curious how others have experienced or interpreted this kind of dynamic in long-distance or online friendships. Did it stay in the realm of friendship for you? Did it evolve into something else or shift back to strictly platonic? Is it sustainable without anyone catching feelings ? Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "My boyfriend 22M and I 22F have been together for just over 2 years and we have been through extreme ups and downs together, Im talking miscarriages and near death experiences. Ive always been really hard on him and I have extremely high expectations of myself and thus, of him and when he doesnt meet these it honestly consumes me. There are so many factors that are telling me to break up with him but also many that are telling me this is a lesson for me to learn how to exist in a relationship. My background is not great, Im the first born daughter that had two alcoholic parents and experienced domestic violence and narcissistic abuse firsthand, I had to be the best in everything and I was a gifted child who academically thrived and honestly thats my only source of self love. My partner on the other hand has two loving parents who actually allowed him to be a kid and he is the least anxious person I know. He has his insecurities, something Im sure he has picked up on the way throughout his life but he never lets them affect me. Unfortunately when we fight Im very aggressive and blunt, something I suppose I had learnt I needed to be to protect myself, I need to be rational about everything and I tend to think and think and think. My partner takes this rightfully so as an attack and becomes defensive and upset at the way I spoke to him. Which is completely valid and I get it, honestly if the roles were reversed I would probably shut down, I recognise this is something I need to work on but he frustrates me so much. The frustrations come from everything, they come from me having to show him something I figured out when I was 10 or telling him how to spell something, or explaining simple maths to him. He is honestly stupid and it makes me loathe him. I have started to hate his parents for not doing something to build his intelligence but then again they arent educated either. His mum was a stay at home mum and was always there for him - another thing that upsets me. When it comes to important things I cant tell if its genuine lack of experience or idiocy - for example one time I was at work and he wanted to surprise me with a nice room, he lit STICK candles WITH NO BASES and left the room to pick me up. I got back and I was livid, how could you be so stupid to not have a single thought as to why that might be a bad idea? Another example is he FORGOT to register is motorbike and he let me ride it for the day, I got pulled over by the police and they told me it had been unregistered for months and I got a huge fine. When his parents called him and he explained what had happened all they said was thats okay love it was an honest mistake. Am I fucking going insane? Like no thats a stupid mistake and you need to face the fact that it was stupid. I dont know if Im too harsh on him because of my own intrinsic expectations but the stupidity is really starting to get to me. Do I just need someone who is on the same wavelength? This relationship has made me fantasise living alone and never having to deal with incompetent men again. But he treats me so well and he loves me so so much and I love him so much as well, which is why its so sad it has come to this but I feel like Im losing control of myself. I cant help but think Im settling for someone who treats me right and loves me because no one else has ever done so in my life but Im also scared if I leave him Ill never find anyone who loves me the same way.",

The problem is that I think I have grown apart from him. I still want to be with him, he is my best friend, but I dont feel romantically towards him anymore. I also dont find sex with him to be as good as it once was, which is very difficult. Ive had it like this once before, but that time it quickly went away again. However, this time I just cant let it go. I dont want to be his girlfriend, but I dont want to lose my best friend. I think I have to break up, but I just dont want to lose him, but I know that it probably wont be possible for us to be friends after this. How do I go about this?",

    "text": "Me M26 and my Girlfriend F25 have been together for just over a year now. Were in such a good place, so happy together, and for the most part have hardly had any problems between us, nothing of any serious note anyway. Before she was with me she saw someone in one of her friend groups. I dont know the full details of went down I dont really want to and its none of my business anyway but they ended up stopping seeing each other and my girlfriend told him to never contact her again because it just wouldnt benefit either of them. Fast forward 5 months after that and when me and her had been together for a few months, this guy messaged her saying happy birthday. Not a big deal and I didnt care, now in the past month hes messaged her twice checking in on her. We had a chat about it and Ive said to ignore the messages but if another comes in she should restate that she doesnt want any contact. She agreed this is the best way to go about it because she doesnt want any drama in her friend group which I understand. Is this something others have dealt with? Whats the best way to go about this going forward if it happens again? Part of me feels like its nothing to be worried about but I cant help but think hes trying to get back in her life.",

    "title": "Private Road Easement Questions",
    "text": "Location: NY not city Hello! My fiancée and I just bought a house! We have been very desperate for a house and we love this house, our one issue and its not a dealbreaker just something we want to seriously consider options for is that it is on a private road with an easement. That isnt the hugest deal except that the house essentially has no driveway, and where the current owners park is not even the property for the house. Im under the assumption that our real estate lawyer may be able to provide some further details about what exactly the easement is for parking, access only, etc. My questions are and this is assuming everything else works out like leech field/septic location, cost, etc 1. If we already have an easement to access our property do we need permission from the road owner to make our own driveway? I am under the assumption that regardless if i need permission or not i should speak with the owner of the road and make sure theyre okay with it. 2. If we already have private road access to the house could we potentially make a driveway that enters through the nearby public road as well through the backyard into the side yard, if we wanted to avoid using the private road altogetherassuming the town/city/state allows it? Would that require an address change or is that something that is optional? I tried finding someone in a similar situation online but couldnt find any details regarding this situation. 3. Again it isnt a huge dealbreaker for us, because we really want a house, hate renting and we got a good deal compared to how properties have been going around this area multiple times we have been outbid with houses 50-60k over asking, but we feel a bit uneasy that part of what i would like to this is our front lawn and walkway from the current driveway to the house is actually owned by the owner of the road. Would it be better to just broach this subject with the road owner in the future and potentially purchase this small piece in the front lawn from them? 4. Realistically, if we are parked where it seems like is the driveway for this lot and the current owners of the road sells and some other owner has issues with us parking on their property, what rights do i have? Not sure if pictures are allowed in this sub but arrows are potential driveway options. And you can see from the lot lines that part of the front lawn and where wed be expected to park until a driveway is made is not part of the lot for the house. It seems like the past owners of the house havent had a problem with this but what worries the most is if we have guests over or have a family gathering for a holiday or birthday party for our future children. This is why id like to just avoid the whole thing and potentially make a driveway from the public road i believe it is a state road though because its named after a local state park e.g. state park name Park Rd. not sure if that changes anything Image of lot: https://imgur.com/a/rDiV81H",

I was in a corner and I had no idea who to tell the truth so I kept texting both with the same feelings I like both a lot, I think theyre very similar in many things but Im afraid to hurt one of them because they basically think Im gonna marry them in the future.

    "title": "Why am I not enough for love?",
    "text": "Rejected again-losing hope I 37F have been struggling trying to figure out what I want went it comes to my love life due to all of the rejections Ive received. Im losing faith that I will never find love I apologize for how long this is but Im tired of being rejected and I need advice on what it is Im doing wrong I am extremely shy and guarded and insecure so its a struggle for me but People say put yourself out there so I try to be myself and be honest but none of my love interests last more than a month and Im starting to wonder if theres something wrong with me? Here are some issues that I face when being open and honest Experience- Ive had a lot of trauma in my life. I wasnt allowed to date until I was 16yrs old and I respected my mother enough to listen to that rule. She ended up passing when I was 16 so I didnt end up dating. The loss of her was to much to focus on men or boys. I never got to experience high school love. By the time I was ready to date which was around 18 I put myself out there but not as much. I would go on small dates here and there but nothing long term until I met this guy via MySpace and allowed myself to get catfished for almost 3yrs. Never do that its not worth your time. This made my sexual experience physically non existent but we would sext so I was open to exploring my sexuality. I was finally able to wake up from the fantasy of him and had a few flings but I was shy when it came to sex because I was 22 with no sexual experience. I was sexually physical with two men but it never went further than 3rd base and I stayed a virgin until I was 24 because I was waiting for someone special. I felt worthy that no man touched me for that long, I was proud and never ashamed but I noticed that the men I told always had an issue with it so it took longer for me to find the right partner but I knew my worth and was not going to settle. Heres where it all went down hill I never lost my virginity it was taken against my will by a coworker I thought I trusted and confided in. He date raped me one night I was celebrating my promotion. To say that i didnt trust being near men after that is an understatement. It destroyed my self worth I stopped dating for a year. I decided to stay celibate again until I found the right person but I was lonely so I changed my mind and lost my revirginity to a friend I didnt enjoy the experience at all so it was a one night stand with a friend. We never had sex again. I became celibate again and met someone who made me feel so much attraction like I couldnt resist him. No one ever made me feel that way before and I was so sexually attracted to him but he sensed I was inexperienced and I felt like he was not interested in me enough long term so I ended things when he couldnt answer what he wanted between us after a month of dating. We never had sex I wanted to be sure. I was 26 by that time. I was so lonely but I still didnt give up putting myself out there. The trauma of the rape took a toll on me by this time. I started being wreckless and drinking and I was lonely. I wont get into much detail but I had 3 sexual experiences with strangers and only once. Im mortified to say this but Ive literally only had sex 4 times and was raped once. I have no other physical sexual experiences. Most of the time I just watch porn or sext online. Im now celibate another 5yrs. Ive tried not telling men because Im not an open book and Ive also tried telling them. Ive tried casual sex its not for me obviously. Ive tried the opposite sex Im not sexually attracted to them. Ive tried being honest and said I want long term. No one I speak with is looking for that or they gaslight me into thinking they want the same and go radio silent after really getting to know me. No good male role models- I was molested as a child and my father is a dead beat. Ive dated all different types of men but I dont know what a real man looks like. All of the male role models in my life arent great examples to base a romantics connection off of. I dont really have many male friend for traumatic reasons. I struggle with my self worth and value. I dont feel worthy of love. I feel extremely tainted and I dont value myself sometimes. Im getting better now but as soon as I put myself out there again I keep getting the same result. How I carry myself I feel like I give off this aura of damaged goods and sexual deviant and those are the men that gravitate toward me. Id like to believe I am very attractive so Im constantly over sexualized which makes me feel disgusted. Lastly I dont know what I want- I just know what I dont. I wrote down all the qualities and things I want in someone but since Im losing faith that will never happen for me. Im slowly contemplating whether I should just settle. I think sometime I should just meet someone and just have sex with no emotions or attachment but I know deep down this isnt what I want. I know I want a deep connection and friendship that leads to love I am a sexual person but I want to have sex with the right person and idk what to do anymore I need help I am currently in therapy- I was diagnosed with Severe PTSD from my trauma- I am not sure if this also contributes to why I always get rejected",

    "text": "4 years post divorce. Despite her affair our divorce was amicable and we have co-parented fairly well until now. Our parenting agreement states that neither parent can introduce the children to a new partner until the relationship has been at least 6 months long. I followed the rules and introduced my then girlfriend now fiancé to the kids around 7 months. I even gave my ex the courtesy of meeting her before the intro. About a month ago my ex informed me she had been dating a guy for two months and she was letting me know because our oldest daughter had found out from reading her text messages. Almost immediately my oldest started telling me how excited is she is to meet the guy and that she cant wait until they get married. I sat her down and explained thats not exactly how dating always ends up. Since then without prompting my daughter has continuously been telling me details about her moms relationship. At first I thought she was reading her moms texts but when I pressed for how she was getting this info she said mom was telling her. Some of the information is a bit too intimate and downright creepy. For example she said that he gives really good back rubs. More recently she said moms mad at her boyfriend and theyre not talking right now. She has also said she has been told to keep it all a secret from her younger sister7. I had a conversation with my ex and in the most peaceful manner asked her to keep her relationship info to herself. She needs to be a parent not a best friend with our daughter. In addition she is alienating our youngest by keeping secrets. She gave me a promise that I didnt buy and sure enough my oldest continues to share info unprompted. This doesnt technically violate our parenting agreement but its certainly skirting a line. Its not healthy for our daughters but Im all out of ideas other than to continuously bring this up with my ex.",

    "title": "What do I do?",
    "text": "Hiii this is my first time posting here, and Im not a good story teller, so itll be quite long winded. I 20F was broken up with by my boyfriend 21M, lets call him P, almost three months ago. We had good times, but hard times. Some background on me: I brought a lot of baggage that I thought I had grown out of from the past 5 years. Ive been cheated on, sexually abused, lied to, the whole nine yards, and alongside that I have childhood trauma being physically, emotionally, and mentally abused, as well as kicked out at 17 for a disagreement with my mom that turned nuclear and was couch surfing my senior year of HS. But what truly has stuck with me was an online relationship I had for two years on and off, he would make me feel inferior to anime girls, drawings, E-girls, I was 15-16, and at the same time I was in my abusive home situation. He was talking to this girl he swore up and down he wouldnt, and cheated behind my back in an online relationship? That looks like lying about not talking to someone, sending nudes, pretending to be asleep only to see them talking to her in another game chat. Stupid I know, but this caused me to develop an inferiority complex, where I didnt feel like I was enough for anyone, ever. Not my mom, not my partners, not even my friends. I also firmly believe I am autistic, I havent been diagnosed, but Im just pretty sure I have it. I have emotional meltdowns, Im sensitive to sound to the point of my body feeling like its getting ripped apart if something is too loud or too consistent, when I get overwhelmed my voice goes completely monotone and I have trouble expressing myself with emotion, and often find myself screaming in the back of my mind to make things sound nicer, but I dont know how. This has caused a few things, anxiety, insecurity, when things happen, and people show me a reason to not trust them, it takes me a while to fully trust and feel comfortable with them again, Ive h always hated this about myself but I have meltdowns, I say things that are incredibly hurtful and I shut down and ,I believe its stonewalling? , i feel trapped when this happens, because the emotions and issues that cause these meltdowns are usually ever present, and dont go away, so its a constant cycle of things never changing and me continually getting pushed to a point. Im sure I butchered that, but saying all that to say I dont know how to regulate emotions, and Ive been told I go into fight or flight and protect myself by doing that, its never out of malice, it never was and never has been, it just feels like something snaps and I have to get all the built up everything out or Ill explode. P and I dated for almost a year, during that year we stretched each other thin. I lost trust in him early on, found him following a bunch of Instagram girls, and he said a few things that made me feel really bad, these things created a weight on me, and even though he unfollowed the girls, and apologized, it still stayed with me. I stayed, because I wanted it to work with him, I genuinely adored my time with him, but building that trust was taking a long time, and I still had my doubts and insecurities. Which came up a lot. It wasnt bad the first few months, but then I was introduced to his family, and the inferiority got BAD. His brother despised me, he would act incredibly distant, any time we tried to spend time with him and his girlfriend, tried to all hang out hed avoid it. It was okay at some points, but then the next time Id see them itd all go downhill, and hed blame it on me. I make sarcastic jokes, and sometimes they come off as really bad and I dont realize they can be taken a certain way until after the fact. We were all sitting at dinner, Ps dad made something Id never had, I loved it, his brother went to get seconds and I said save some for me bro I was messing, not thinking hed take it as a comment on his weight or eating habits, but he did. And I was so fucking sorry, I felt horrible, and wanted to apologize and set it straight, but he refused to talk to me, and from then on would go silent any time Id enter the room, and stated to P you have let me know when your girlfriend comes over i felt horrible, I felt like I wasnt accepted by his brother, or liked by his brother, and the anxiety of being a burden in his house and that the opinions on the parents would become negative, it weighed on me every day. It caused so much stress and anxiety, i felt like nothing I did nothing I said would ever fix it. That, coupled with the stress and insecurity birthed at the beginning of our relationship grew. It started with me saying I bet you want ha to random girls on the street, breaking down over him following girls from highschool on his Instagram, I would make comments about how he wanted me to look like his ex girlfriend, the anxiety was eating away at me, and my behavior and comments were eating away at him. We would have arguments, my voice would go monotone because I was so overwhelmed, and hed rightfully so feel like I was talking down to him, even though it was never my intention. Wed have conversations, Id sob and apologize for my behavior, and then the ever present anxiety of the situation would take me back in, I felt stuck. It was my first year living alone, providing for myself for the first time, living paycheck to paycheck, and the anxiety of everything was taking me away from the person I loved the most, I was hurting him. His parents were supportive of our relationship, they had a judgemental air to them, and it scared me. They labeled me as a difficult relationship due to my living circumstances, and my past. They were right, but nothing was done on their end to help soften the anxiety being caused by their son and their judgment. My boyfriend wanted so badly for the two things he loved most to be together, his family and his partner, and the constant anxiety of what would happen going over there was chipping away at me, if I said I didnt want to go over there, hed get sad and think I hated his family, and would be heartbroken, and if we stayed the weekend at my place, his family would say hes not spending enough time with them, and that Im taking him away from them. But when I would go over there, the same things would happen, the silence, the discomfort, and wed argue. The emotions would be heightened, and wed argue about SOMETHING, and even if it wasnt bad, hed cry. Hed cry even if it wasnt an argument, maybe just a disagreement, but his family saw his puffy eyes after wed leave his room, and they noted this every time. I was the one who constantly made their son cry. This went on for a few months, there was a month where I didnt go over to their house, and P never told them the true reason why, hed passively let his brother say things about me, mischaracterize me, build this unsafe environment, and would get upset at me when I said he needed to put his foot down and not allow it, not allow these things to be said. But it continued, and I said mean things about his brother, I said he was entitled, stuck up, pampered, mean. I regret letting my emotions get the best of me this entire time. But a week before we broke up, I yelled at P in the car. It was late, we were driving home from my grandmas house, we were going to get Mexican food. And he put on a song with a girls voice. I had no issue with it, I just thought her voice was kind of annoying, and he said I knew I shouldnt have shown it to you, because it has a girls voice in it and that rubbed so far the wrong way that I snapped. I dont remember what I said, but I know it was mean, it was harsh, it was hateful, and it made him sob. I broke down, I got overcome with emotions, pent up things, and I hurt the thing I loved most. And I regret it, more than anything. He left the next day, saying I can never talk to him that way again, and I understood. A few days later was his birthday, I went, his brother was okay, but brothers girlfriend was giving me the cold shoulder and she usually did, but I pushed through the night and kept on, but when my boyfriend and I got in bed I talked to him about it, he said that I didnt say hi to the boyfriends sister either, and I got upset, we had a small argument, and then we went to bed. The next morning we were in the shower, and it was brought up again and he said that all I was seeing was in my head, that everything I had said or thought was in my head. This made. Me incredibly upset, I said how dare he say I made things up, when it was very clearly happening and he knew it, and I left. I didnt have it in me to talk to him the rest of that day. I couldnt, he texted me the entire day, I told him I needed space, I needed to think, I needed to calm down, and that Friday he broke up with me. He left, and I was devastated. I had pushed away what I loved the most, I had let my past dictate how I felt, I had become the monster I swore Id never be. We got back in contact a few days later, wanting to fix things. I wanted to work on the things that have hindered me, Im about to be 21, I dont want my past trauma to dictate every part of my life. Wanting to work on things, to make them stronger and better, to support each other, but not in the detrimental way that had been. But his parents said no. They said theyd never support it, they said theyd never let him go back to me. He spoke to his father, who screamed that I was never allowed back in their house, that i was abusive. They gave him an ultimatum, me or them, and if he picked me, there would be consequences. I want to change, I want to be stable, I want to trust I want to love him, I dont want to let go of this because I know he is the person I love, but what do I do. The last three months have taken any happiness away from me, Im always sitting with a lot of anxiety in my chest because its not like it was before, were in limbo. A horrible limbo, he says things are getting better, that hes talking to his family about things, but he hides me. He says hell stop doing that, but how do we build that feeling of relationship back. He sees me once a week, in the morning when everyone else is at work. I cant go see him, because he said his partners would be combative. How do we do this? Im so lost, I want to change, I know I did wrong, I know I hurt him deeply in an attempt to protect myself. He wants this to work, I want this to work. But how?",

    "text": "The last year had been incredibly rough. My 32 husband 35moved my MIL 60f permanently to live with us without discussion. He signed up for sexual meetup sites and I fear he has cheated on me but wont be honest about it. He also was not at all supportive when my own mother was in the hospital with cancer. Im angry about something in the past every few days mostly around he has treated me but also my mils behavior. He is improving in how he treats me but Im so hurt by the past. He is in therapy and trying to work on his issues and is transparent with me about who he goes out to meet etc. things have also improved with my MIL but its still a burden as she cant drive, cant communicate in a language I know, and also has made many requests to change my behavior to fit her culture and diet but when theres a small request from me to not spray a scent around the house that gives me intense headaches she still does it. My husband wants kids at this point and I still dont fully trust him or if I ever will be able to. Since my MIL is living with us I know that she will give input about our children as well and my husband told me to just ignore her. Ive tried to explain to him how Ive given up a lot and have tried incredibly with his mother and him but I feel like he and has mother didnt try until I mentioned I was considering a divorce. He has improved his behavior quite a bit and wants me to focus on the future, but im not sure how to get over everything and focus on a better future when the past has been so terrible.",

    "text": "This will be a vent so get ready. I put entitled in quotes because I am honestly not sure what to call this type of behavior lol, and thats why Im asking for advice - I dont know how to put in words to her, in a polite way, what shes doing thats bugging me. I have a friend whos easily my oldest and closest friend, weve known each other since we were little. Now were both adults. For some context, I moved out of my moms house and about 7 hours away, and she lives with her parents still - which is totally fine, but I also think its relevant, because every time we hang out, she asks me to pay for stuff. When we hang out we usually go on a walk, bike ride, or chill at one of our places. But almost every single time, she suggests that we go get food. Im not totally broke, but Im also a college student, so in order to save money and afford life I usually dont buy anything thats not necessary. Its usually okay for me to go get a coffee once in a while, and its fun, so Ill often say yes. But every single time, she either asks me to pay in exchange for her driving me there, or say she forgot her wallet. I was raised to ALWAYS offer to pay no matter what, so if someone asks me to its ingrained in me to just say yes, otherwise I feel awful especially when I can afford it and its not breaking the bank. But its every single time. Not only that, but last time we went on a hike together, she offered to drive us and then asked me to venmo her gas money for it. Last time she came over, she asked to go out to eat again and I said I couldnt this time, to try and hold some kind of boundary. She said she was super hungry and asked if we could make something here. I said sure shes a good cook and so she made us both dinner from what I had around the house. She kind of just went through my stuff and didnt really ask if she could or couldnt use stuff, and didnt clean up after herself. It was a tasty dinner, but when she left I still honestly felt very annoyed. I have a hard time socializing/making friends, and have dealt with abusive behavior in my life, so its really hard for me to stand up to someone and say no, or confront them for treating me in a way I dont like. In all other ways, shes a great friend to me and I dont want to lose her. Does anyone have any advice of how I could approach her about this in a way that doesnt make her really angry or quit being friends with me? Like I said, confrontation of any type is so hard for me, and its really ingrained in me from how I was raised to always offer to pay for meals and whatnot, that its really rude to refuse to pay for someone. If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you deal with it? Thanks in advance! :",

    "text": "After the passing of SOs father, we went over the will. TLDR: the little money that was left the house go to the wife their mother.... Fathers Pontoon Boat the Truck that went with it are left in SOs name.... Past this, there is not much of liquid value. A few other things split between two other siblings. but nothing major given to them in name. Siblings are furious that my SO essentially inherited the only two big things 60k in value i guess if its sold. My SO is distraught because she inherited them due to a close passion for boating that they bonded over and she told him previously that we would never sell the two and would keep and maintain them forever. they would be how he lived on... Thus us being named for receiving them in the will. Regardless, siblings are furious. Want them liquidated and split amongst each other. will says otherwise. SO also saying she will pay whatever to keep them and stop them from being mad. Everyone is doing well off and its not like 15-20k would change our lives. sure thats a good chunk of change, but it also isnt like Sibling 1 is having a hard time getting food on the table, while Sibling 2 just inherits a big liquid asset. this is just the beginning of lots of fights i guess. idk what to do. thats why im here asking for advice",

I vote yes, he votes no. My reasoning: why have the money there if you dont use it? Why owe a medical center and set up a monthly payment plan with them when we can just refill our emergency fund? His reasoning: pregnancy is something that can be planned for and could have its own savings category. If the debt is 0 to a medical center, why not set up a payment plan with them vs use our emergency funds? I can totally understand everything he is saying. Its not a huge argument or anything but something we have been discussing as we prepare for the future. Whats your take on this? What would you do?",

Around 3 months ago I discovered she had been Edating at least 1 guy and had sent nudes to many other men althought I dont know what their relationship was like for sure. It had been going on everyday our entire relationship. Shes adamant that she only used it as a means of escape and never met or wanted to meet them irl. I also found out she had a grindr account a bit before and during the first 6 months. I love her so incredibly much and I believe she feels the same about me. We have been living together for around 3 months now. We both have somewhere to go if things go south. I was alright for the first month after I found out but after her repeatedly lying about things like how many people there were, what apps they were on and about her doing it while I was around, I just dont know what to believe except that she loves me. Her father passed away a few months before we met and she transitioned a couple of years ago which I know have both taken a massive toll on her. My feelings change so erratically throughout the day. Mostly just depressed. I dont know what to do. We tried having a couple of breaks but they dont last very long. Any advice is greatly appreciated :",

This insult was specifically charged at her ideology, I called her a Zionist. In case you are wondering, I am reading the Torah right now, I was just tired of hearing her make remarks and of her insults towards me specifically after lectures. I am a proud homosexual, and shes spent years insulting me. Shes also quite aggressive with Muslim women, very critical of them. She is quite fervently anti Palestinian, categorising all of them as terrorists. Even the kids She has said horrible things about Palestinian people in general. That they deserve whats coming to them and I quote. This prompted me to send her a message, not a very smart one, I concur to send her a message attacking her ideology. Yes once again not very smart. I thought of this as a silly feud, but she wants to press charges??? Will she be successful???? Location: France",

And how this has continued to happen for the past 1,400 years. They didnt contribute to humanity a single thing but they invaded, raped forced conversions of other religions, massacred girls from small child to womens, terrorism killing and precedence and suppression of religion. And stating how they deceive and come in refugees and how they change the integrity of country from internally. And how every country should stop taking muslim refugees. eg look at uk and other countries. In India muslims are treated as minority Just 18 I know that its above that. . But the government is giving holidays in Ramadan and Eid and more. But why are the Hindus not getting this kind of holiday in India despite it being a Hindu nation. Like india is the only Hindu nation left in this world. I had also wrote in description that we should not accept muslim under any circumstances or its going to be extremely detrimental to our future generations. And he saw this post and straight voice messaged threatened me to kill and decapitate my head... And some things unimaginable regarding about my parents and ... I just cant type it. Im not scared neither I feel shame or concited about myself. Because what I stated is truth and I will remain to that. And I also know that muslims who would be seeing this post and anti hindus are gonna definitely report and come in my dms to threat me. This is the resolution if a Hindu speaks for his right in his nation.",

    "title": "What should I do?",
    "text": "Sorry this is very long For context: 21F have been friends for over 12 years with lets call her Sofie shes the same age as me. Throughout our friendship Ive learned that Sofie is a good friend she does care about me and I care about her. We both were bullied in school and when things were rough at my parents home Sofie would let me stay over at her home I am very close with her mom too. We both enjoy horror movies, good food, chilling by the water or a fire. Over the past few years Ive realized that Sofie doesnt like spending money for activities or food when were hanging out which is alright but limits what we can do. When me and Sofie make plans she always wants it to be at her house, she lives 45min drive away from me. I dont mind going to her house but recently Ive been asking if she would like to come to my apartment instead because the drive is a lot when I have to drive each time especially after work She said shes more comfortable at her house which I understand and thats its expensive in gas to drive to my place etc. I dont mind having to drive there but I just wish we could occasionally meet halfway or I can pick her up from a closer town so that way she wont have to drive the 45min Ive offered but she doesnt want to. Sofie has a job but she doesnt work often approx twice a week. She does live with her parents and they pay for her car, car insurance, groceries etc. She does pay for her phone bill and gas and like theres nothing wrong with that but I just want you to get the full picture. I would love to go to the movies or try out a fun restaurant but she doesnt want to spend money. Me and Sofie have a mutual friend for many years lets call her Sara and we all three love hanging out and going to the store together usually for groceries and snacks to then bring to Sofies home and getting take out and watching horror movies. We have plans this week at of course Sofies house like it has been the past few times which is a bit hard for Sara to go because she lives even further away about an hour drive but 20min approximately from my apartment and her car has been having lots of issues so sometimes she drives to my apartment building and we get into my car to go to Sofies place. I do sometimes feel bad for being loud when were all talking and watching movies because Sofie lives with her parents they are very nice and know me very well they do ask us to be more quiet sometimes and Sofie gets into arguments with her parents often when Im at her home which can make things a bit awkward. This week we have a day planned with me, Sofie and Sara, the plan was to get lunch go by the water and talk and then dinner and after go to Sofies house and watch movies. Me and Sara have been talking on the group chat about where we could go to eat for lunch and dinner and we both agreed to wait to see what Sofie likes too but we gave a few ideas that are not expensive and delicious near Sofies home. Sofie didnt answer for a few days until today she said she wants to go to the chip truck for poutine for lunch and she only decided to focus on one of the three options weve said for dinner and Ill call the restaurant Carlos because I dont want it to reveal where we live. She said Im sorry but Carlos is a little too pricey for me, Im trying to save money not going out to eat and the poutine place is like 12 but the bill at carlos always comes to 30-40 without the tip, I could maybe come but I wouldnt get anything or maybe a very small portion, I dont think they would let me get smt from the kids menu Im not sure we can maybe talk about it Saturday Sara: Okay so what r we gonna eat for dinner tho?? Sofie: I lowkey wanna Carlos with yall I fucking love it, its my fav take out place so we can do it but well have to do like delivery because I cant get the kids menu if we go in the resto and we can watch a horror movie at the same time Sofie: If thats good with yall, I also hate eating in restaurants but if you guys really wanna go inside I can figure smt out Both me and Sara didnt answer her text. She doesnt want to go to the restaurant and would rather deliver which is gonna be more expensive. She also said she doesnt like going in restaurants which is odd because she often goes with her dad. I dont know what to say I mean I understand she doesnt want to spend money on unnecessary things but she also just went on a trip to the Bahamas with her other friend and keeps sending us hauls from what she got from SHEIN. So Im like trying to understand why its hard for her to spend 30 for her dinner. We could always share an appetizer together and just have a drink but I dont know if she would want that. Sofie is an only child and doesnt like going out in public and sharing things. Ive often payed for her Starbucks drink because she said she didnt have the money and I still wanted to go so I offered a few times to pay for her and she would get a Trenta drink. I never asked for the money back because I offered. Sofie has money she tells us she doesnt but she confessed a few times that she does have lots of money saved and in her room she has a bunch of cash laying around. I dont know what to do anymore I feel like the more time goes on the more I feel like I have to always do the effort to see her Im always the one that has to drive, I have to make sure to eat before hanging out because she doesnt like to go get food with me and it does suck that we cant do anything else but rot at her home. Sofie can be scary when she gets mad and she is on mood stabilizers to help and she has improved over the years but she does yell and rage easily she has been physical in the past not with me but with others and she has extreme road rage I do not like to be the passenger in her car. Im scared that if I try to talk to her shell get really angry and well stop being friends. I want to have a conversation with her but I dont know how or what to say I dont even know if my feelings are valid. I also dont want to ask Sara what she thinks because then I would feel like Im talking behind Sofies back. What would you do ? What should I do? English is not our first language so I hope its written okay I didnt modify the text messages except for the restaurant name so sorry for the typos",

    "title": "How much should I pay my parent to live at home?",
    "text": "Alright yall, cheers to my first Reddit post! Sis needs some help so please let me know your thoughts. This is a long post. PREFACE: I 31F am living at home with my mother 51F due to severe financial struggles. I only work part time for now but am looking for full time work. My debt minimums come to 1,080. I have nearly 0 leftover right now but anticipate a monthly net income range of 2,500 - 3,000 when I get back to full time. How much is reasonable to pay her for rent/lodging? CONTEXT: I, never in a million years, thought I would be living at home at this big age or for this long. However, I had SO many misfortunes and drawbacks that its been hard to stand on my own 2 feet. I feel like my biggest contributing factor is my mothers poor money habits. In her youth, she filed a medical malpractice suit over her doctors handling of a serious illness. She won her case and received a settlement. Didnt put a single penny towards my future. She let her first husband not my biological father,hes deceased spend it all up. So by the time I was graduating high school and looking at colleges, my only options were student loans and state grants. By sophomore year, I knew my debt was piling up and I wanted to drop out to go to work. My mother would not have it because she felt like I was throwing my future away. She threatened to kick me out and put me on the street if I did. Fearing homelessness, I stayed in school and let my debt pile up. I did get refund checks but she required that I gave her half to help her with the house bills since she wasnt working. I graduated and struggled to find steady employment. I thought my degree was safe but realized that was not the case. So I stayed home while I tried to find work. I job-hopped a lot, taking whatever was available. My mother has always struggled to pay her own bills because she didnt work following her illness, so I was doing the best I could at the time. We could never agree on a fixed payment because she would never take the time to sit with her finances and figure out a budget. So I was giving money to her pretty haphazardly to help with bills and groceries. Since her request for money was always random, I never got the hang of saving money because there was always some fire to put out. The pandemic exacerbated these money problems. I was out of work and facing pressure from all my debt lenders. Eventually, I was able to find full time work. I did move out for a year when I was 28/29 but had to come home due to job loss. I was able to get a part time job that Ive been working for the last 19 months. I thought I would be able to easily move to full time work at this employer, but I recently learned that is not the case, so Im looking elsewhere. I REALLY want to prioritize aggressively paying down my debt, however, mother is still struggling with bills and because of that, I dont think I can focus on my goals. She did get married to her second husband, who does make a 6 figure salary, but hes also terrible with money and doesnt pay bills effectively. She also started working but immediately started racking up credit card debt. They claim house bills are around 2K a month. In my 20s, I did push back on paying to live at home. However, now in my 30s I guess I feel guilty about being equally as codependent. So Im trying to figure out a realistic amount that allows me to pay her rent, pay my minimums, and also lets me have some money left over to tackle this debt. I just feel like at my big age, she doesnt have to let me live here, so I should pay something. I have about 16K in private student loans, 70K in federal student loans, and maybe 30K in consumer debt credit cards, personal loans, etc. Originally, I wanted to use 90 of my full time salary to pay as much of my debt as I could in 12-18 months. I just feel guilty and selfish for prioritizing myself under someone elses roof. So, back to the original question: What is a reasonable monthly amount I can pay my mother for rent?",

If you dont honor, respect, trust, value, and all the other things you swear to in your vow, than you broke your vow, even without cheating. You are no longer required to be expected to keep that marriage together all on your own. Its supposed to be partnership. Any kind of relationship, from straight up friend, all the way to multiple partner non-monogamy requires some form of those kinds of supports, but only marriage codifies it explicitly. I like to think of the Olivia Rodrigo song, at the end of the chorus: I guess you didnt cheat, but youre still a traitor. Im putting this in r/relationship_advice because it should be true for ANY kind of relationship, even though I wrote it addressinf wedding vows. If you struggle to see that and feel the need to comment otherwise, go troll someone else. Me M37 and my wife is F36, and we have been talking about this a lot recently together. If a relationship has already died because one perso. Wasnt feeding it as well, then infidelity, while still bad, is a moot point the marriage was not fine until the cheating.",

    "title": "What do mixed signals from an ex really mean?",
    "text": "I broke up with my ex-boyfriend 3 years ago... Even after all this time he still has my number saved and even my dads. Were still connected on one social media platform. About a year ago i reached out to him but his response wasnt positive... He made it clear he didnt want to get back into a relationship But heres the part I dont get he still keeps my number and my dads, and from what I see, he doesnt seem happy in life. He recently broke up with his girlfriend, and he keeps giving off signs that hes sad or going through something...Now Im thinking of calling him just one last call, to get closure maybe. Im in a healthy relationship now, but i still find it hard to completely forget my ex i have a lot of memories with him, and forgiving him has been really hard. Would it be wrong to make that one last call? Or should I just let it be?",

    "title": "How should I feel about my bf shitting the bed last night?",
    "text": "I 27f have been sick with the flu and my bf 46m and I just got back together after being broken up for 2 weeks. Hes been at my place all week taking care of me and cooking me food, making sure I dont die. Normally hes not much of a caretaker at all so I was enjoying being with him while hes actually trying his best to take care of me. We obviously have an age gap and had been long distance for almost a year so when we did see each other everything was very romanticized going out to nice dinners, staying in nice places, me dressed up or in lingerie. He prefers it this way. Im normally really healthy but I overworked myself and killed my immune system so coming home I felt bad I wasnt my usual dolled up fun self and hes been handling it well. Yesterday I was feeling the worst out of all the days flu wise and had a uti I get them a few times a year from sex and was pretty concerned as I was running a low grade fever that I might have something bigger going on. We were laying in bed and I went up to shower but came back into my room to grab an oversized t shirt to wear at which point I noticed an overwhelming stench. I thought it may have been one of my 2 dogs. I see him grabbing at the sheets and scooping things up with his hands at which point he tells me that he farted and accidentally shit the bed. Im horrified as he isnt sick at all and Ive never shit the bed past toddler age. I attempted to turn on a light but he yelled at me not to so I simply left the room to let him deal with it in private as to not embarrass him further. I went to clean up the kitchen and set out clean sheets and lit a candle. He took the soiled sheets to the bathroom and attempted to wash them. I worked in a nursing home in college and have been traumatized by the accidents I witnessed and cleaned up there so I kinda have a poop phobia. He ended up throwing them out and remade the bed with what I set out. I told him to please shower as he wasnt going to and he thankfully did. While he showered I put the candle in the room and a new comforter on the bed. I didnt give him a hard time and told him its fine lets not talk about it and I love him. He was embarrassed and wanted a hug and kept repeating it was no big deal and nothing happened. Then I showered and I rubbed his back until he fell asleep. The thing is, it really did gross me out like hes not even sick? How did he shit the bed?? Hes always someone who thinks girls especially pooping or farting is gross and we should always be beautiful and done up etc. I like that our relationship is a little more real lately but that was a bit much. I keep thinking about it and this morning when we woke up he was really pushing sex on me which Im not even supposed to have with my uti and I just let him but wasnt super into it as I was still thinking about the poop thing. He left my place today since my mom was coming over and now Im not too sure how to feel and if I want him back tonight. Am I over thinking it?",

I was informed today by the manager that I signed a 60 day notice and they are willing to waive that until 6/6. I reviewed the initial employment agreement and it does say that if employee leaves then 60 days notice is required. There is nothing that gives any consequences. The employee handbook says 30 days and that PTO may not be paid out if less than, even though they have ETO and I dont really care about getting that. Do I have anything to worry about with this? I am starting a new job beginning of June and do not want to delay that start. For some additional context I am a clinical social worker and there will be others who can take the clients I have been working with. I know Michigan is an at-will state so Im not sure what actual consequences can happen, if any. Besides the employee agreement there was no other contract and there is nothing I can see that indicates any legal consequences. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "So my16f bf17m this was around 2 weeks ago told me that he wasnt completely honest about something from the past. A bit of back story, we met online on an app and we became friends then started dating and then he moved down here where I live we have been dating for over a year and a half. he told me pretty recently before we had this conversation that he didnt class dating online as real dating and I said why date me then. He already told me he sent a dp to someone before he met me but he didnt remember who , well he told me that it wasnt only a onetime thing and it was with one of his online friends who I knew because of him but I havent spoken to her much. Anyways he said it was more than pics but not irl because theyre only online. and then he told me he did it in the start of our relationship and while we were talking but it was only two days in and idk if I over reacted or not that I class it as cheating because ik alot of ppl do class it as it and alot of ppl dont. I have spoken to a few of my close girl friends about that and a couple of them said it seemed like he played me. I am surprised I wasnt mad but idek. I didnt really have a reaction when he told me but I had an adrenaline rush and I just felt numb and I kept going through stages of nothing,fine,disgusted kinda. But I did start having a panic attack in the bathroom 2 days after and I didnt have a appetite for like a week. I think the reason that hurts the most is that it was actively lying about it and for literally our whole relationship. He also blocked her but I didnt tell him to. Sorry for bad wording.

    "text": "Hello, I do not want to ask AI for help on anything so I am returning to this reddit thread. You all helped me so much on primary sources for the Middle Ages. Here is the rundown of my project: I am designing the curriculum for a WESTERN HISTORY-PHILOSOPHY combined course at a rigorous Classical Academy. As part of the rigor my goal is to have the entire course be History from Primary Sources. Junior Year the students are going to do American History from the colonial times to modern day. With the following 7 units of study what are some primary sources you would suggest: - American Settlement and Colonization -The American Revolution -Westward Expansion -Civil War and Reconstruction -The Great Depression and lead up to it -WWII -Current Events Hopefully this isnt to large of a question, any help would be appreciated.",

    "title": "Can I sue my former boarding school for systemic abuse and emotional harm? MS, USA",
    "text": "Hi all, Im seeking advice on the legal plausibility of suing a religious boarding school I attended as a minor. Im 20 now and was enrolled at French Camp Academy FCA in location: Mississippi from age 12 to 16. The school is still in operation. I recently wrote a report outlining both my experience and dozens of public allegations shared in the comment section of a viral Facebook post about FCA. These comments describe similar and repeated patterns of abuse going back many years. Some of the key allegations include: Physical abuse paddling that left welts and bruises, often from adult men toward teenage girls Emotional and religious abuse public shaming, forced confessions, labeling trauma responses as rebellion Unsafe punishments forced isolation in the woods, strenuous labor, redshirting as public humiliation Retaliation against kids who showed distress or spoke up Discriminatory treatment of students based on family status, mental health, or perceived obedience Potential fraud misleading families and donors about the nature and safety of the program I have not yet contacted the others who shared their stories for formal statements, but their posts are still public. My goal is to understand if this is something worth pursuing legally before going further. I would likely not be the only plaintiff if a case moved forward. My main questions are: 1. Do these allegations suggest grounds for a civil lawsuit or criminal investigation? 2. Would emotional distress, institutional negligence, or Title IX apply here? 3. Could the public Facebook comments count as preliminary evidence or leads? 4. What steps should I take now to preserve my legal rights or gather stronger evidence? I know Id need a lawyer, but Im not sure if I have a case worth bringing or how strong it might be. Any guidance or resources would help. Im especially curious about statutes of limitation in MS for survivors of childhood abuse. Thanks in advance.",

    "title": "Should I rent and prioritize peace, or stay in a toxic household just to save money?",
    "text": "Im 24 F, and Im stuck trying to decide if I should move out and rent to prioritize my peace of mindor stay in my current living situation with my dad and save money, even though its draining and toxic. Background: From 1618, I was completely independent. I was in school full-time, working full-time, and living in my own condo. My credit was excellent, and I had a strong head on my shoulders. At 18, I got into a relationship with a man 12 years older that became emotionally, physically, and financially abusive over six years. I lost my independence, my financial freedom, and my mental stability. Things spiraled worse during the breakup, when I also got into a car accident that left me unemployed and without transportation. As a result, I now have around 30k debt in collections, 10k in student debt, and a credit score in the 500s. Where Im at now: I live with my dad rent-free, which allows me to put almost all of my income toward debt repayment and savings. I work full-time remotely and make 70k base with potential to earn 100110k through commission. My car is paid off, and I only pay for insurance and my phone. Im in a stable place mentally and feel really focused on rebuilding my life. But the living situation is really taking a toll on me. I live with my dad, stepmom, and little brother. Its not peacefulits tense and emotionally heavy every day. My dad and stepmom barely speak. Theres constant passive aggression, weird dynamics, and a lot of toxic behavior that honestly triggers memories from my past abusive relationship. On top of that, I dont get along with my stepmom. She does bizarre things like putting the garbage bin on the kitchen counter even though my dad installed a custom pull-out drawer for it, piles up everyone elses stuff while leaving hers everywhere, and has even thrown out or burned my dads belongings without asking. She pays zero bills and is extremely controlling, while my dad just tells me to ignore herbecause he cant stand her either. Anytime I try to speak up, it creates chaos. So now I just stay quiet and walk on eggshells. Its draining and honestly makes me feel stuck and resentful. My dad encourages me to stay longer so I can save, even suggesting that once Im on my feet, he plans to divorce her and sell the house. But that adds even more pressure, because I feel like me being here is part of the reason hes holding offand that just makes me feel guilty. I know hes not happy, and I hate feeling like Im somehow enabling the situation by staying. Also worth noting: Im single, child-free, and not currently interested in buying a home. Id rather travel more and have the freedom to live life on my termsso owning property isnt even a priority for me right now. What I need advice on: Should I stick it out, stay with my dad, and keep saving aggressively to clear my debt and stack my savingswhile sacrificing my peace and mental wellbeing in the short term? Or is it smarter to move out and rent a place of my owneven if it slows down my financial progressso I can protect my peace, heal fully, and finally have some independence and stability again? Im torn between whats financially smart and whats emotionally healthy. If youve been in a similar positionor have any insight at allId truly appreciate your thoughts.",

We were together for only 3 months but she was my first ever girlfriend ever and I was so commited to her , deeply cared about her and invested so much on her . Before she sent the cruel break up message there were already some problems as for example , she was being too controlling and I got mad at her many times because of it . Anyway , she sent me a brutal break up message including openly cheating with another man with pictures , humiliation , her making fun of me with her friends , and she said she was just manipulating me and using me the whole time . And she sent screenshots of her cheating , pictures as well and more .. insulting me .. After that cruelty I blocked her everywhere and I wasnt even sad at this point because she was horrible to me . I quickly moved on and started dating again . What happened is , two weeks later she started crawling back at me I got messages from her friends telling me how sorry she was and to forgive her etc and she also non stop called me many times even harassing me with calls telling me to come back . I blocked all her calls of course and I didnt accept not once her apology I told her to go fuck herself she has mental problems . Is it normal to this to happen ? After a painful cruel break up they come back crawling at you after ? Im also devastated",

Ive consistently been promoted and have taken on major responsibilities, but my work environment has become emotionally and professionally toxic. My boss co-owner made out with me in the office and tried to sleep with me. I stopped it, but the dynamic since has been complicated and uncomfortable. He also had a long-term affair with another employee, a close friend of mine. On top of that, theres been about 3 situations where he belittles me in front of the teamonce to the point where I broke down in tears and had to leave a meeting. The other boss avoids conflict and does nothing to intervene. Recently, I voiced that I was overwhelmed and needed support. They initially agreed, but later came back saying Im overpaid 96K is too much for an assistant, and pushed me to fully assume a role they promoted me to a year agowithout ever defining responsibilities. I do much more than assistant-level work, including handling deals start to finish. I feel emotionally drained and diminished. Im considering quitting and want to know if I might be eligible for unemployment or FMLA based on mental/emotional stress and hostile work conditions. Would I qualify for either? Should I consult an attorney before taking action? Thanks in advance for any guidance. FYI I did use ChatGPT to summarize this. Ive been using it to vent and get advice. Location: Washington State",

It all started innocently enough. Just a cozy farming game, she said. Itll be relaxing, she said. Next thing I know, Im competing with a 2D villager for her affection. Hes got it all, apparently. He always has time for her, he gives her gifts she actually wants, and Im pretty sure he never leaves his socks on the floor. He even helps out around the farm, probably. Does he snore? I doubt it. Can he hear her complaining about my real-life habits? Definitely not. I try to win her back. I offer to watch her favorite show, I attempt to cook, I even LOAD THE DISHWASHER THE RIGHT WAY. But does it matter? No. Because Sebastian just gave her a Sashimi, or Elliott wrote her a poem about the sea, or Shane... well, he probably just grunted at her, but apparently, thats endearing now?! Im starting to take it personally. What does he have that I dont?! Has anyone else faced this? Do I need to start leaving Loved Gifts around the house? Should I change my career to Fisherman or Miner?",

They didnt elaborate much past that so I called my uncle to understand whats going on and he told me these exact things: 1. She had passed suddenly and all of her money was to be given to charity never married no kids 2. Some entity related to her work is acting as her trustee 3. He has seen the will and I am not a named beneficiary My aunt and I were friendly but hardly close so I did not expect to be included in her will but if I am not a beneficiary why do they need to include me in the matters of her estate?

    "text": "So I 30f have dated a man 44m for 4 yrs . We both have a previous relationship and have a kid from before . We been thru so many up and downs and its been from the very beginning that he was clear He doesnt want to establish anything serious and doesnt want kids . I have been immature in the past and tried to mentally play games but he has not given any mind to it all. I always end up coming back. Anywho. My mental traumas are for another discussion Hes showed me not to be jealous , not to argue , not to be dramatic , how to ignore problems the list goes on . he treats me very well and acts and provides as a man should with getting things done and always being active . The problem is Im 30 and I want to have kids and be a wife . I tried doing the wife things but his mind is set . He just took me on a baecation and it was Amazing . Adventures and everything. . But like I said this reached its peak. I met this other guy 1 yr ago hes 35 at my friends party . Weve been dating for 7 months now and immediately hit it off . Ive been spending most of my free time with him. We talked about moving in and having kids already and I really like him . Thing is . I tried ending things with my long term boyfriend but every time my new bf messes things up or doesnt perform he way I expect him to I end up being selfish and getting that masculine energy I seek from my long term boyfriend and were back together . My new boyfriend is more soft and sweet and gives me all the attention I desire from my first partner but he doesnt move as quick as the other . He also isnt great at initiating sex or adventures . But I feel like an asshole for telling both that I love them and keeping up with both is super hard and I never wanted to be this way but Im afraid I leave the first boyfriend Ill regret it when the second isnt competent enough. Please talk your shit Im open to hearing the Critisism. I feel horrible and Im even tried asking god how can I clean up my selfishness ,Im not proud of this at all. All I want to do is find my partner i am aware I have codependent ways and being honest If I was caught by my first bf I wouldnt feel as guilty as if I got caught by my new boyfriend because we have had conversations where Im telling him Im all for him. Should I end it with both? Confessing is out the question Im too much of a coward to admit that to either of them . Oh and they both live within 10 min of my home so sharing local shops is always terrifying .",

    "text": "Hello, My girlfriend 24F and I 25M have been together for 2 going on 3 years. Last year while we were together at my place at the time i still lived with my parents and we had a night of drinking and we fell asleep pretty late around 3 in the morning. I was trashed so i was as stiff as a rock, nothing was waking me up according to her. My sister and her baby father also lives in the same house. The next morning when we woke up around 8am we got right into it and had sex. What was weird was that she was already extremely wet and we didnt even do any foreplay nor was she ovulating. I thought it was weird but didnt think anything of it. Later that day we went to my cousins house for a cookout she asked me did we have sex this morning? and i said yea you dont remember and she said i didnt know if it was a dream or not and made sure i didnt take advantage of her and she said i didnt. When we arrived at my cousins, i had an extremely weird feeling when her and my sisters baby father were talking. When we left they hugged in a way that made me have a terrible feeling. Later that night we go back to hers and watch a movie and out of no where she says What if you did something that could destroy a family? my heart sank and i looked at her with this empty but worried looked. She instantly reassured me that the question had nothing to do with me. Time passed and i forget about it until today when my coworker said something that made me rethink the whole situation. He told me a story about how him and a girl he was seeing were having sex and he fell asleep and when he woke up they got into and she was already really wet and he said i was weirded out because why are you so wet, i thought she went and had sex with one of my roommates but i remembered we were having sex before i accidentally fell asleep. Im very conflicted and cant stop thinking about this. How should i proceed with this?",

But a few days ago me and him were at a bar having a few drinks and I started to feel some nicotine withdrawls. Mainly discomfort and sweating. He saw that I was suffering and he waved a cigarette infront of my face and said I should smoke it just to get through the withdrawls. Anyway that ended my 3 day streak of not smoking and Im back on it again. I dont know whether to be mad at him or not because from his perspective he was likely just trying to help me get through what should have been an enjoyable night. But Im still lost. Any advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": "this is a repost with more details added hi everyone, i 22f have had really strong feelings for a friend of mine 21m for over a year now. we have always had really good chemistry, but we only hang out with our friend group. he have been alone together before many times, but its always while we are with our other friends if him and i separate from the group. in the beginning, we flirted all of the time and we really hit it off. i think he was going to try to kiss me we were alone in my apartment, about to leave to meet our friends at a bar, and he was sitting next to me on my bed, starting rubbing my thigh and asked if i still wanted to leave, i nodded but kept my head turned away from him bc i was nervous then he hastily left the room, i felt rejected, then i left him in my apartment. that was last march, and there have been many other questionable events since then, but i would be sitting here for hours and typing. around halloween, we had a misunderstanding and i sort of told him off, and things have not been the same since. the chemistry is still there, but i can tell he has his walls up with me, and i dont know what to do, because him being closed off makes me insecure about trying to open back up to him. please help! love ya edit: ive decided to add some more context. he also has called me baby on multiple occasions, doesnt correct people when they assume we are a couple or joke that we sound like an old married couple, always pays for my drinks or gives me money for no reason. he said i love you to me once while we were saying goodbye on the phone and i said thanks you too and hung up the phone because i didnt want to say it knowing he meant it in a friendly way and i meant it as more than that. on another night, we were sitting in the backseat of a car while our friends went into a store, and he started telling me how a stranger he was talking to in the bar asked if i was his girlfriend, and he responded no were just friends and the stranger said just friends yeah weve all been there, it gets better. the while we were talking he started getting really close to my face and tracing his fingers along my arm, but it didnt escalate because one of our very drunk friends ended up coming back to the car. a few weeks later, he was talking to my two best friends about how he is scared of dating in the friend group because he doesnt want to loose the two of them too if things go wrong he didnt say he was talking about me, but both of the girls are not single, and aside from them, i am the only girl in the friend group, he also became closer to them by hanging out with me but heres where things get complicated, i had a small gathering the weekend before my bday, he couldnt make it bc of a family thing but never told me that and just didnt show up. then sent me a bunch of texts apologizing the next day, and then proceeded to not say anything to me at all on my actual birthday so i felt like he was gaslighting me. then, after not hearing from him for a few weeks we both were busy with work and life, nothing else he ended up cancelling plans with the guys to come to dinner with me and my two girl friends, then proceeded to bring up how he thinks about the night in the car and the night before the bar every day, and then asked if i would go to a carnival with him and his friends. i genuinely really wanted to go, but had work and other obligations, so i couldnt make it. when i texted him in the morning thanking him for the invite, he didnt reply or even read the message. weeks later, he asked if he could come see me in my city, i said yes, and then he ended up blowing me off the day of, which was why i went off on him, saying over text why would you ask to come here if you were going to do that, because i could have had other plans we didnt talk for about a month, and i eventually apologized, and now we are fine. the next time seeing him after that, we went to a club, he bought me a drink, was dancing with me fnot in a totally sexual way sadly but i was kind of grinding on him a little, i dont know how to put it into words without a physical demonstration, then later at night when everyone fell asleep our entire group had a sleep over he was telling me how if anything were to happen between him and a girl then cut himself off to say sorry i mean a woman that he would want to be friends with her for about a year and really get to know her first, because he doesnt like hook ups, and proceeded to go on about how hes not talking to anyone or dating etc. we now just find excuses to subtly touch each other in crowded rooms, or he stares at me from afar, and most conversations are casual everyday things for even more context, i have never been in a relationship, i am terrible at taking hints, and i dont know if he feels the same or if i am reading everything wrong. im extremely confused. please help",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I both 27 have been together for 4.5 years. Im sort of at a point where weve been together long enough that Im trying to decide whether we are at a stage for marriage and, if not, what that means for us. As part of that process, I suggested he and I go through a list of relationship values questions to see if we were in sync about what we wanted/expected after marriage. One of the questions involved finances and asked about how wed commingle finances. Now, as backstory, we both have good jobs and make good incomes. That said, I am an attorney and my yearly salary is a good bit higher. As an attorney, and also as a child of divorced parents whos seen first hand just how much people can get screwed over in a divorce, I am a bit cynical and wary of commingling all finances. I told him Id probably want to have separate finances but a shared account from which wed both deposit to pay for mortgage, car, living expenses, etc He said he was fine with that BUT would expect me to pay 2/3 or even 3/4 of a lot of these things because I make more money. I was pretty shocked by this and thought it seemed pretty unfair. If we split the cost of house 2/3 to 1/3 and then got divorced, the value of the house would be split 50/50 per our state laws between uscausing a big loss for me. I asked why we couldnt just stick to purchasing things that are within his means and split 50/50, and then save the excess income on my end for the future. He asked what the point of squirreling all that away would be. I shrugged and suggested retirement financial stability? He said we should live within my means because we dont need to save that much. I was like, what, like a sugar mommy? And he said well, yeah, kinda. The conversation sort of puttered out after this. He suggested a prenup if I was so worried about it, which is a potential option. Still, the whole conversation kind of rubbed me the wrong way and Im feeling conflicted about it. Itd be one thing if I decided down the line to spoil him, but it feels weird that hes going into the idea of marriage expecting Ill be paying for a majority of things in the future. Its just not what Ive imagined for an equal partnership. Itd be one thing if we had kids and he were a stay at home dad or something, but kids arent really even on our radar at this point. Anybody have any advice for this situation?",

    "text": "Location: North Carolina. I recently had an issue with a faulty medical product and I was researching it online, when I came across a form for what appears to be a class action settlement about the product from Keller Postman. I filled out the form . Since then Ive been getting non-stop calls from them basically begging me to sign the contract to release my medical records and let them begin a case. The person who keeps calling me does not seem to be a lawyer and will not tell me if its for a class action suit or a suit just for me. They wont really give me much information at all and says that after I sign the papers my team will contact me and explain more. The contract states that I wont be liable for any cost unless they win. The contingency fee is 40 and they also state that they will reimburse themselves for any other expenses such as court fees. Something about the situation just feels suspicious to me and I wonder if anyone else has worked with this firm in a similar case. Ive been trying to Google it and find it elsewhere on reddit to no success. The only thing I can find is that some people did get a reimbursement for an SAT class action case, but I didnt see anything about them signing documents. I dont have any experience with legal matter, so please help me if you can. My main goal is just to recover the cost of my medical expenses.",

    "text": "We have been together since we were 19 years old. Our relationship in the beginning was not great. I definitely liked him a lot more than he liked me. He would talk to his exes was always catching him flirting with girls on social media. It was never extreme- but just enough to make me feel like I wasnt good enough. I never really thought we were meant to last. After a few fights about it- it eventually stopped. Over the years, he has grown into an amazing man and we have a very healthy relationship. He is thoughtful, kind, and a wonderful attentive father of our 5 month old. Frankly, these days he treats me like i walk on water. Especially after becoming a mom. I have always had some anxiety about him stepping out or reverting back to those behaviors he engaged in our early 20s. When we got engaged- a lot of these feelings dissipated because at that point he had stopped for about 3 years was obviously serious about committing. All of the sudden these feelings are rampant again. Im not sure if its postpartum anxiety or what.. but I constantly feel like I am going to find out something that will devastate my marriage. I even looked through his phone one night just to read the old messages from like 2016 of him being crude about other women. It made me just as upset as before but I obviously cant bring this up to beat a dead horse. I try to just stay in the present and look at him for the man he is now but its so hard. Its not really fair make him address these behaviors again so I dont even want to bring up how I am feeling. I do find myself feeling resentful know how stupid that is. I keep having thoughts of just being alone forever. Theres just a feeling of relief to think about never having to look over my shoulder again wondering if another person is lying to me. Feeling hopeless that I cant even find peace in a GOOD relationship.",

Here are the details: Home purchased: Last year April 2024, brand new construction for 450,000 Interest rate: 6.5 Closing costs: We paid zero in closing costs New company benefit: Theyre covering realtor fees up to 20,000 if we sell Monthly mortgage payment: 3200 Were trying to decide: Is now a good time to sell, given its only been a year? Or should we rent it out and hold on to it as an investment? Were open to either, just want to make a smart financial decision. Any advice or similar experiences would really help!

    "text": "Hi! So Im not sure if Im overreacting, but Im moving into my first place post-college and my roommate 22 and I are having to figure out the furniture situation. We plan on getting most of our furniture secondhand if possible in order to cut costs neither of us is making a lot, which is fine for the most part. However, she wants to get our couch for free from someone her parents know, which would save a lot of money. I dont think of myself as a huge germaphobe, but I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of getting upholstered items secondhand. Couldnt care less about wood or metal, but any kind of used furniture thats got fabric makes me feel weird. While she was nice when I told her this, she insinuated that I thought her parents friends werent clean, as well as the fact that were on a budget and new couches are well upwards of 300. Whats the best way to address this respectfully? I completely get her perspective, and its not anything against anyone, but its an ick Ive always had and I dont think Id ever be able to sit on it in the apartment. Should I compromise and am I being unreasonable here? Any advice appreciated!",

    "title": "Military Move Inconvenience Claim",
    "text": "Location: Bremerton, WA Kind of a niche subject, I know, but Im wondering if its time to lawyer up. I filed my HHG House Hold Goods move in February of this year through the military. It was confirmed to be scheduled by a moving company un-named for a pack up and move out of my apartment for May 30th with a window of May 24-May 30th to accomplish the move. On May 9th the moving company cancelled the move. I immediately rescheduled for a new moving company to do my HHG shipment, but the earliest available dates the military could find were between June 6th - June 13th. Now heres where the damage is done. Because I had my original move confirmed since February with confirmed dates, I went ahead and scheduled my honeymoon for May 31st through June 10th a lot of it being non-refundable at this point. In addition, I terminated my apartment lease for May 31st and also set up Lawn Care Services for my new house where Im moving to while Im in transit to my new duty station. With the new moving company there is the possibility I have to cancel everything booked From June 6th no refunds in order to fly back home and pack up my apartment. almost 4,500 in total, closer to 7,000 if I have to cancel everything booked from May 31st. And I am required to be at my next duty station by the end of June. I am not authorized to ship my vehicle on the militarys expense so I have an allotted 9 days to drive to my new home approx. 2,500 miles before the end of June. I submitted an Inconvenience claim only for the extension of my apartment lease until June 14th to include utilities, renters insurance, and the rent about 1,000 and did not file a claim for potentially cancelling all the booking for the honeymoon. But the moving company denied the claim and in summary claim to have no responsibility since they never actually performed the move. Is it time to find a lawyer or should I take the L and cut my losses. I understand I have the option to have a Power of Attorney for someone Im close with supervise the move on my behalf, but since Ive only live in this city for 6 months previously stationed in Japan and on such short notice its going to be difficult to ask my co-workers to watch it for me. Also any family members I have live across the country. In addition I do have the option to perform the move myself and get re-imbursed, but I have about 5,000 lbs worth of items in my household and moving that myself across the country would be difficult for me and my wife who doesnt have a US drivers license yet. If I was going to move it myself, I would sell a majority of the items I currently own, but seeing that I need to be at my next duty station by the end of June, its going to be difficult to sell everything in a few weeks.",

Of course his family is grieving and she was acting sad about it too but not even a WEEK has passed and she got a new boyfriend. She is acting as if no one just died and is being all happy, saying stuff like I love the love of my life and I hope he owns me forever???and other stuff like that. When I mention to her the fact that its literally only been SIX DAYS her response??? Oofff maybe I shouldve waited longer lol WHAT THE FUCK. Someones life just got tragically cut short and the first thing that you do after theyre gone is go shopping for a new guy. I didnt even know this guy personally but for me this is so disrespectful to him and even his family. I hate how shes talks about someones death as if it was nothing. I dont know if I want to be friends with her anymore because of how much this has gone against my morals but she has a past of her threatening me with suicide and telling me how Im the only friend she has. This hasnt been the only time that shes done something bad, which I have tried my best to ignore and label it as her not knowing better because of her bad past, but I feel like this is my breaking point. I dont know how to speak up about how I feel since Im scared to tell her and idk if Im just overreacting about this all and I should keep being there. What do I do???",

    "title": "My 20NB boyfriend 18M might break up. How can I have done better?",
    "text": "My boyfriend A and I currently do long distance. Not so long, maybe about 40 minutes. I live in a dorm. Weve dated for about 4 months, but were very serious and this is our only big argument that we havent resolved yet. The day before last night, mothers day, he was talking with his mom. I was in class, and my iPad froze, so I reset the tablet and called him again. We call on Snapchat. My airpods werent automatically connected, so I told him to mute. He said Hell no, Im not muting. and Im not going to mute unless theres a good reason. Right after, we argued because I, unfortunately, am a goody two shoes. I told him that I was upset he didnt mute because the other option was to end the call if I didnt want to get in trouble before my airpods connected. We went through a whole I was talking to my mom, and you can press a button while talking to your mom. We argued over text too. I mentioned that he said he wouldnt mute, and this is what truly made me angry. He said Who said I was talking to you? Im flabbergasted. Who are you talking to on the phone if it wasnt me? Who are you saying you wont mute to if it wasnt me? And, to make things worse, he said he didnt hear me. How could you respond to me if you didnt hear me? Unless you were on call with someone else at the same time. But he only has one phone, so I know it isnt that. I told him I wasnt putting up with his manipulation tactics. I told him I wasnt going to apologize for calling him out on gaslighting me. He, for the first time Ive seen it, accepted it immediately, apologized, and said hed work on it. Last night, I came back to campus after leaving for several days for interviews. The day I came back, I had gotten several kinds of insults from teachers. I got so upset and broke down in my dorm, and A called to comfort me. These insults consisted of comparisons between me and other students, about my interviews, and about my absence. I told that teacher I had interviews those weeks. Im entirely unsure what happened while I was gone. I was also restricted from leaving the campus on the weekend, which was when I planned to see A and enjoy my time with him without the stress of interviews, even though I came back to campus following protocol. A managed to help me make a plan to help myself get through these situations. I slept poorly, despite feeling okay and the thought of this day tormenting me. So we woke up this morning. The first thing I thought of was man, I have to talk to these people about this situation. And I suppose I phrased it out loud as complaining about the situation. My boyfriend constantly told me, dont talk about it, it will ruin your day. While its a great thought, Im not exactly a positive person. I can be self conscious at times, and quite aware of my self degrading comments. So, these rants dont affect me. However, they affect A. I told him, Hey, it wont ruin my day. Its already bad because of what happened. Its not bad yet. Still, I dont want you to say that. Im just trying to help. The conversation continued like this. I told him that sometimes people dont want help and thats okay. You cant force someone to change their mind all of a sudden, after all. He kept on going with the im just trying to help. This was the start of the day. It aggravated me because I really, really did not want his unsolicited advice. But he was so insistent. Then, we ended the call after getting a bit mad at each other, and he was going to the gym anyway. I was in class. I asked him to call me again when hes done in the gym. So we did. However, I didnt speak. I told him in text, Im embarrased to speak in call in a quiet classroom. He made fun of me, saying hed embarrass me outright if only he were on speaker. Jokingly, of course. He does this thing where hes asking me Whats one thing you know about me? So I asked him the same thing in my own way, What am I? It isnt specific, so it leads to a much bigger pool of answers. He got confused, and answered Youre a person thats embarrassed to speak in a quiet class. and? .. Youre shy and youre embarrassed to speak in class? After him not understanding, I clarified it and how I felt. You know me as a person. What am I? Thats a long list. Answer the question. but Im lazy. He keeps on avoiding the question. I wanted one simple answer that wasnt the one I gave him. I made it clearer. Im starting to feel like you dont know who I am. I know you very well! So, who am I? Cmon, Im not doing this with you. Youre not easing the thought of you not knowing who I am. We went on, blah blah blah all day. Until, I said I guess you dont know me as well as you thought. He immediately went silent, and got angry. He started playing games at this time. I suppose I egged this one on. I added, and do not bring this into future conversations. He exploded. He had a habit of pettiness, but so do I. He said I should trust that hed changed, but it only happened recently and there was no proof that he did. Like, cheaters say the same thing, right?! He then asked me to beat our game on his own. Im a kind of person who enjoys starting stuff together and finishing them together. Its a special memory to me. So, I said no. I want to be there when it is. But, he had a problem with that, although he knows how special it is to me. Keep in mind hes playing another game the whole time, not sparing me a glance every so often. Its just a game. I got so upset at him because clearly, in this time of figuring stuff out together, he didnt even focus his attention on me. No one second, no nothing. Just focus on the game. I told him that I was upset with it and it made me feel like second priority, and only after that and twenty more minutes of arguing did he put it down, unplugged everything as if he was proving a point, then said there, im focusing on you now. And DIRECTLY AFTER that, he said his focus was still on the game and after our talk hed go back onto it to beat another boss. I flipped out. Second priority, and he said it. And finally, I had a meeting after class to go to. I was on call with him. The instructor made a whole speech about how I didnt tell her I was gone properly I did, btw and she marked me absent for all of them. She said I wouldve gotten terminated from the meeting for that if I wasnt graduating soon. It made absolutely no sense to me, at all. I cried in the meeting a little, and my boyfriend was trying to take my attention away from the meeting on the call and telling me youre okay. First, Im in a MEETING. Dont take my attention away. I said dont tell me Im okay when Im in the goddamn meeting, dont take my attention away from something that requires it. And he said no. He said hell no he isnt, and to end the call or he ends it instead, because hes not going to leave me alone to do what I need to do because I was crying. Good in spirit, not necessarily circumstance.. What could I have done better? TDLR My boyfriend and I fought all day and now our relationship is on the line over many reasons, plus him refusing to leave me alone in an important setting and because I told him I felt like a second priority.",

    "text": "Maybe its just my sister but she literally begs to miss school on days where there are important football games. Whenever shes watching and they score shell literally yell and scream and say shit like VAMOSSSSSSSSSSSSS YEAHHHHHHHHH. The issue is shes so fucking loud even when we repeatedly tell her to quiet down about it. We have tenants in our basement with a newborn baby and I can only image how troublesome it is for them. Not to mention it just grates on my nerves for no particular reason. As far as I see it, there is NO reason anyone should be so happy about these sorts of things to the point they disregard basic manners and considerations. She literally tells us we wouldnt understand after I tell her to quiet down and that its not that big of a deal. Maybe its just the fact that shes 13 but this is literally her only passion in life and she does not give a damn about anything other than running around with a ball.",

    "text": "Location: Kentucky I am the wife of a Black father in rural Kentucky whose parental rights were terminateddespite completing every service, filing to be involved, and never once being found unfit or abusive. He was incarcerated for child support while the system ignored the fact that he was being actively blocked from his daughters life. This wasnt just a court errorit was a coordinated campaign of obstruction led by someone who publicly claims to advocate for family preservation. The mother of his child and, owner of an LLC. promotes herself as a champion for parent voice and trauma-informed care. Her website presents a beautiful message about nurturing families. But behind closed doors, she used the court system to sever the bond between my husband and his childand to cause emotional harm to our entire family. As a result of the trauma, I was forced to take FMLA medical leave due to anxiety and emotional exhaustion. This hypocrisyadvocating for family unity in public while destroying it in privatemust be addressed. Would I have a good case to win in court and how likely is it that I could hire an attorney to represent myself?",

    "text": "Location: Arizona I work for the big red target company with that little dog mascot . I have been there for almost two years and recently I was given my first write up. Thats fine, I didnt not agree with it and understood why, but since it was written I needed to sign it. When I logged on to our computer, it hadnt been sent through yet and they said to check another day. A couple days had passed and nothing yet. My teamlead asked if I had done it, said I still hadnt gotten it so she went to our HR person and after she came back I asked if it was fixed and ready for me to sign, to which she said, they did it for me? Is this legal, or is this forgery of my signature?",

    "text": "Can I afford a wedding or is it stupid? Were having a hard time justifying our future wedding expense. Our ideal is having the wedding in Italy, very small 20-28 people, and create an experience for our family closest friends. However were having a hard time stomaching the cost, especially with our upcoming expenses. The wedding, including all miscellaneous expenses will likely be 40-50k. My income this year, will be around 1.2-1.4M, hard to get an exact figure because its a small business. My fiance isnt working yet, but this fall it will be in the 200k range. Has student loans doing public health forgiveness, and essentially 0 saved. What were struggling with is our other upcoming expenses. Were starting the process of building a home, and Im saving for a sizable down payment. Were budgeting for future kids, expenses, etc Including our own debts. What were struggling with is spending 50k on a wedding when that could go towards our home, honeymoon etc etc What were also struggling with is the possible regret of not doing it. Having all of our family in one place, multi day event, and a nice life experience we wont repeat. I want to hear everyones thoughts and if Im being stupid.",

The new job would be as a sole lead credit underwriter where I have would to help build and manage the line of credit we have. I dont know if I maybe out of my depth and I am rushing into things too soon, I have not talked about the package which comes with the new role however the idea of the immense amount of new tasks and skills I would get for working for a start up not only would look good on a CV however would build a solid name for myself. I know the risks for start ups failing is a lot higher and I am in a okay position however I dont know if perhaps I am selling myself a dream which in reality could be a nightmare.",

He constantly smacks my ass, whether Im lying face down on my bed, or just walking past him, and its not normally just a love tap. Ive asked him multiple times to stop, and hes always gotten mad and ignored my boundaries. Recently, hes made a couple jokes about me being submissive and breed-able no exaggeration. Ive told him it makes me uncomfortable, and he shrugged me off and said Okay, so now that were past that, can I call you submissive? To which I said No. And he replied, Why? Is it because you sometimes feel submissive? And now, just the other day, he told me I had nice boobs. Its getting past a point Im comfortable with, but I also dont want to report him. He tells me he loves me, and he doesnt hit me or be rude. I dont think he means it in a weird way, but when I told my friends, they told me to tell a trusted adult. I can take it, Im not worried hes actually going to do anything, yk? But what should I do, if I do anything?",

    "text": "Im in a high-pressure, high-responsibility role thats starting to wear me down. The kind of job where youre expected to be on 24/7, no overtime, no proper boundaries, and very little room for error. Its not the kind of work where you can coast. Every day feels like a performance you cant afford to flub. But my area of work responsibility is riddled with inefficiencies and mismanagement that make everything feel soooo worse. I often feel isolated and deeply disadvantaged, despite being someone who really tries to rise to the occasion. What complicates this is my own drive. Ive always had a chronic need to achieve. I need to feel competent, knowledgeable, and on top of things, and when I dont, I spiral. I feel stupid and like a failure. Ive been noticing that its made me resentful. Ive become negative and somewhat increasingly bitter. I still have gratitude always, but Im tired, more pessimistic, and too often venting to people, in thinking they are safe spaces who would understand my stress. However, Ive recently been told Im very negative and a little bitchy but Im so grateful they told me as they were nice about it and Im happy that I get to reflect on where Im going wrong. Its given me quite a wake up call. When I was younger, I used to do all this negativity from a place of insecurity I felt ugly so I used dark humour and snappiness to be quirky. I grew out of it and found it cringy. I became better. Im still shocked when people say Im nice. But now knowing that Im back to this because of my environment its making me spiral. The issue is, I dont know where to put all this. I journal, cry, talk, joke, sleep too much or not at all. I try to stay positive, but even that feels fake.. like Im forcing it. I know Im dulling other peoples lights just trying to process my own burnout. The job gives me so much in terms of learning and growth, but its eating at me.. I dont know how to be soft and gentle anymore I feel like Im on battlefield and have to be on guard and tough. I guess Im asking: how do I find genuine positivity again without leaving my job? How do I learn to stop spiraling, to speak more lightly about things, to stop letting frustration define my personality? I want to laugh again. I want to be more than a bitter shell whos good at their job but who complains about everything about it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are moving in together soon. His best friend, lets call her Emma, has two little dogs. My boyfriend used to help out a lot with dog sitting, until I came along a year ago. I already have a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to dog sitting for her, as shes guilted him into helping out last minute which has ruined our plans a few times she doesnt have many friends and used to rely heavily on my boyfriend. She once had him stay at her apartment for 10 days while she went on vacation I was welcome to join him of course. So its not just a few hours here and there, shes always asking for a lot. Emma has been getting dog sitting help from a new-ish friend but theyve recently went separate ways she expects a lot and doesnt pay, Im assuming they got fed up. My boyfriend recently asked how I feel about Emma bringing the dogs to our new place. If Im being honest, I do not want the dogs at our place. For a few reasons I dont want Emma to assume that we will start dog sitting now that we have a place, and has no one else to do it. I also just dont want dog hair all over our new stuff. I dont want to clean up messes in our new apartment. The dogs are yappy and I dont need complaints. Emma is extremely strict with their feeding and walking schedule she has an hour-by-hour itinerary for whoever watches them. I feel Im allowed to have boundaries but is it unreasonable for me to say no? How would it sound to other people that his girlfriend is not letting him watch the dogs at the apartment? I told my boyfriend early on when our plans were ruined the first time that Emma will be a recurring sore spot in our relationship because of her neediness.",

Im 16f he is 44m ! ! On the SundayMay 11 i downloaded this app called Pure a hookup app for curiosity. During this time i was also sexting online as a way to cope with some sexual trauma that happened in the past. Anyways i started texting this dude online, we live in the same city and decided to meet at the park at 11pm, i didnt know he was 44 till after we made plans so i was grossed out but still decided to do it. When I told him I was 16 and now 18 he called himself a dirty old man for making plans with a teenager. He also said things like Im excited to see your teenage pussy i know this is wrong but i love how much of a horny good little girl you are and etc. Istarted becoming very hesitant as this was very risky, so i started calling a bunch of hotlines and going on venting discord servers to try and change my mind. This guy convinced me to do it by showing his address with his face and his house so i did it. At 11pm we meet at the park and I get in his car and he starts touching me everywhere and starts putting a vibrator down there. I regretted it and became very uncomfortable but let him, then he drove over to his place and I got in his apartment where he put a collar on me got me on the bed, took off my clothing and made me bend over so he could cuff my wrist and ankleshe never cuffed the ankles though. Then he starting shoving dildos and his dick in both wholes while putting a vibrator on my clit, he used a shit ton of lube but it hurt it didnt feel good, i was also gagged during this and was actually disconnected and zoned out the whole time. I wanted it to stop i wanted to cry but i was genuinely scared he was going to hurt me. Eventually I do the safe codesnapping my fingers which he listened to luckily and ungagged me and uncuffed me. We then lay down I was shaking a lot and all disconnected. He started jerking it and grabbed my headvery lightly and put it on his dick where i give him head. I pretend i enjoy this and acted like i wasnt scared and disconnected. He then got on top of me and started fucking me and i just went along the n he came on my stomach. He got up got me water and asked if i was ok since i was shaking a lot, i lied and said i was. I put my clothing back on, he drops me off at the park where i weakly walked home as my legs were hurting and i was all disconnected and confused. ! ! During the act i was all disconnected and just blank and now im all confused. I talked to people online and there mixed opinions so please give me your opinion !",

    "text": "Hello everyone. I wanted to ask this question for so long because, for me, it is an important staple in most of our modern view of Napoleon. This campaign made him into the legend that he was and still is in most of our modern historical viewpoints. He was only twenty-six years old at the time, but he already had a clear vision on how a military campaign should be conducted since he had studied Caesar and Alexander the Greats campaigns, and he also had one of the best chiefs of staff that he could ask for Berthier: to which he could rely orders who were then translated to the battlefield. So? What do Historians think about this campaign? For me a man who is currently studying history this campaign was one of the first of Napoleons masterpieces. But what do other respected historians think?",

    "text": "There are many personal finance YouTubers. The money guys, Ramit sethi, The Plain bagel, hell, even Grant Stephen. While the Financial Audit started off at a really good place genuinely helping and counseling people, Caleb has turned into- dare I say- a dck. I know its part of an act, but in this context that only makes it worse IMO. He spends more time belittling and yelling at the guests then he does actually helping them. I understand there are people that need that tough love and blunt honest truth, but that is very different than telling someone, youre either a complete moron or a liar. So here are some healthy alternatives: The Money Guy Show: Hosted by financial advisors Brian Preston and Bo Hanson, The Money Guy Show delivers in-depth personal finance advice with a mix of education and entertainment. They focus on building wealth through smart investing, tax strategies, and practical money tips, often using real-life case studies. https://youtube.com/moneyguyshow?siqux0sCLrLTgkJY1A I Will Teach You to Be Rich: Created by Ramit Sethi, this channel complements his bestselling book by diving into real-life money psychology and personal finance systems. Ramit emphasizes conscious spending, negotiating, and designing a rich life based on individual values rather than strict budgeting. https://youtube.com/ramitsethi?siRrA8LdHvZ_f6E0Ig Graham Stephan: Real estate investor and entrepreneur Graham Stephan offers insights into personal finance, investing, and current economic trends with a clear, often humorous delivery. His content ranges from reaction videos to deep dives into financial independence and wealth-building strategies. https://youtube.com/grahamstephan?sisevMiIyeiB4YtAGh Personal favorite: The Plain Bagel: Run by chartered financial analyst Richard Coffin, The Plain Bagel breaks down complex investing concepts and economic news in a neutral, informative style. Its a great resource for viewers seeking unbiased, research-driven financial education without hype or gimmicks. https://youtube.com/theplainbagel?siWDV0fR950RnlxKMo",

However, after placing the order, Myntra canceled the free gift without my consent, citing a technical issue. I reached out to their customer care, and they offered a 100 coupon valid on 599 min purchase as compensation which I refused because its not equivalent to the canceled gifts value. I then emailed Myntras Grievance Officer and also filed a complaint via the National Consumer Helpline NCH through WhatsApp. Now, Im waiting for a response from either the grievance officer within the 7-day window or a follow-up through NCH. Has anyone else faced this? Any tips on how to escalate this further if they dont resolve it? Location: india",
