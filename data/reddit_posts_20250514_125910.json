    "text": "Ive dated my girlfriend for a year and a half, and we have small arguments every couple of weeks, but it blows over and were forgiving of one another. During the start of our relationship, we were both a year out of high-school, she was in collage and I worked. I knew that she had lost touch with the majority of her friends from highschool and got in frequent arguement with them, leading to losing touch. I was with her at her parents house, and put my hand on her leg, she recoiled a bit and I was a bit offended but brushed it off, she explained that it hurt. I apologised and thought nothing off it at the time, when I got home I remembered seeing cuts on her legs a couple weeks into us dating. So in my mind I made the connection, I thought it was old or something so I said nothing We date for another year, and once in a while we vent to eachother and talk about stuff that upsets us, I remembered about her cutting herself but I had assumed she had stopped as I hadnt seen it in just over a year. Through 14-16 I was really sad all the time. Im aware its a young age and it reads as meaningless but I would still self harm with deodorant, I sprayed it on my skin till it blistered because I didnt want my parents to see blood on my sheets, I spoke to no one about this and I said nothing to anyone until I told her. But I got through it. About a week ago I got a message from my girlfriend explaining how she had a meeting with her councillor at collage and her councillor told her parents that she is still self harming. I had no idea she was still doing it, Im allways asking if shes ok, and shes always talking to me about stuff, but I didnt know about this because she said nothing. Im now at work, reading a text saying my girlfriend is still cutting herself, and the only reason I know is because the information got, in a sense, leaked and now Im walking to the bathroom trying to message her asking why she said nothing, and shes acting as if im asking about why she didnt straighten her hair. Like i asked why do you feel like doing that? How can I help you? And she would respond idk thats how I like doing it and thats just how I do it Im messaging her asking why she never said anything to me, and she said I just didnt I understand its a really serious subject and it everything matters, everyday I make it known I love her, and she does the same, I thought about it, and I cant help her, she has diagnosed insomnia, anxiety, depression and shes cutting herself. She cries when I cant see her, she cries when she cant come here. I love her but its becoming too much. And I know this is probably really self centred, but I know myself and Im not really a hugely understanding person. I do love her and I want the best for her, but I cant understand why she doesnt just tell me and stop cutting herself. I was doing shit for 2 ish years, and just stopped because I realised it was pointless, and I watched a couple videos on YouTube about it, Im really simplifying what I did, but Im also aware mental health issues are far worse for 18yo and young adults, and I understand these feelings are worse at 18 than they are at 14, I am in no way saying I was worse than her, I am simply finding aspects of common grounds to better understand her, or try to Ive posted stuff on reddit before, where I believe Im correct, but everyone explains Im wrong for doing something. I wanted to post this here from my point of view, not asking whos right, or if Im and asshole, but because I legitimately do not know what to do. And Im aware I probably sound like a cunt with the way Ive worded stuff, but atp Im already aware, im exactly like my dad and my dad is a cunt How can I help my girlfriend?",

    "text": "Ill keep it short because its a whole mess of a situation. I met my coworkers about a year ago when I first started working my new job. He was very charismatic, offered help with everything and I just was instantly attracted to him on so many levels. But, I never acted on it. I thought to myself how is this guy single at this age and when he looks as good as he does? Months after, he invited me to get drinks on our day off and I of course said yes, we met up a day later and had a wonderful date, very romantic and all. At the end of it he tried to sleep with me but I didnt let it happen because I have clear rules on who I sleep with and when past trauma. Days after we went for another date but he took me to his friends apartment and made me sleep with him. Yes, made. I kind of just froze there and later brushed it off because I was stupidly in love with him. I thought it was normal but it felt so wrong to be used like that. We kept sleeping together for months, he kept telling me all these beautiful things and promising me so much that it somehow made me fall even deeper, despite our relationship being obviously one sided and very shallow. My feelings only grew bigger and he had me wrapped up around his finger. He said he wanted to meet my parents and go on trips as well. But he only called me when he wanted sex, never took me on dates after the first date. I realised he kept calling me when he was out of the house, or after work if I had a day off. I never went to his place and he always had an excuse for it. I wasnt allowed to tell anyone about us either, or talk to any men apart from him, which in retrospect, I have no idea why I would accept it. So I mustered up the courage to reach out to a person that knows him and told them about our situation and they were so shocked, and said he has a wife and x amount of kids. I felt so disgusted in myself after that and tried to push him away, but being at work together doesnt help one bit. He keeps calling me, being around me and I feel bad when I ignore him for whatever reason. He claims he doesnt have a wife and its driving me up the wall. How do you get rid of such a person that doesnt give up and that you cant hide from?",

    "title": "34F questioning life with 33M after kids?",
    "text": "Okay so this is a long one. Apologies in advance. I 34F have been with my fiance 33M for 6 years 7 in a couple of weeks. We met at university and due to some issues with family ended up living together after only a few months. It was all too soon and we fought quite a bit. We can both be quite stubborn and our fights often got a bit out of hand not so much anymore. For example, once we were out with friends and he thought I was being too friendly with someone I was not and he just walked off and I had to run after him and we were shouting in the street. Another time we fought I dont even know what about and he packed my bag and told me to leave after throwing my phone and breaking it. Still we worked it out. More recently 2 ish years ago he got very angry and threw the coffee table. He has never raised a hand to me, though he has grabbed my arms a few times quite hard but I dont think hes ever meant to hurt me. I fell pregnant 5 years ago and we were very happy and excited to start our family. It was quite tough as we both lost our jobs due to covid. He managed to get some freelance work and I found a job worked through my pregnancy doing some freelance work in the property sector and stopped just before baby came. We didnt have any help when baby was born, which was fine and we managed quite well I think as he was helping with nappy changes and general stuff around the house. I was exclusively breastfeeding so he couldnt help with feeding baby, though I tried to pump and bottle feed when little girl was around 2 months but no luck. Fiance tried a couple of times and gave up saying its not working and she doesnt like the bottle. This would have allowed me to have a little break. I was responsible for everything then. I did the feeding, bathing, changing, bedtime and waking through the night,, laundry, cleaning, cooking, everything. It left me drained. I also struggled with ppd which took a while to diagnose and still on medication to this day. We had quite a big fight when baby was a few months where he broke a glass lamp and I ended up throwing my phone, which he then picked up and threw to the point of it breaking. He said some really nasty things during the fight and called me horrible names like bittch and psychopath. When he does this I just shut down and cry and keep asking him to stop because it just hurts so much. It made me start self harming again, something Ive struggled with most of my life. He apologised and we worked through it all and were happy together but nothing really changed in terms of chores and looking after baby. We then moved to a different city, away from anyone we knew, and it was happy families for a while. One day our daughter fell and hit herself on the coffee table which is when he got angry and picked it up and threw it. He blamed me for her falling and hitting herself on it and instead of comforting out LG in that moment he got angry and shouted at me. This was a pretty big fight following a lot of smaller arguments and I ended up taking my LG to my parents and we stayed there for a couple of days. I dont like this side of him, he has quite a short temper and it makes it difficult to have serious discussions without it blowing up. Anyway, we worked through it and were once again happy and then I got pregnant with a LB. We were excited and I even found a job that allowed me to work from home. So we were both working from home while I took care of our LG and was pregnant. LG didnt sleep through the night and it has always been me that has to go to her, because fiance says he needs to concentrate at work so he needs sleep, or that she doesnt want him and only wants me. I think these are all excuses, if he was persistent and more comforting then she would want him no problems. Once LB was born, fiance tried to help out a bit more by doing bedtime with LG and general things around the house but this was short lived and eventually we fell back into the old roles. I still did everything for LB as he was exclusively breastfed. To this day he does not cut their nails because he says hes too scared to hurt them. We have been getting on with life and just going through the motions, at least thats how Im feeling. We moved house again and are now in a lovely village and in a beautiful house. We are struggling financially as we both have a bit of debt but working on it. LG goes to preschool from 9-3. LB is only 18 months so is home full time. We both work full time from home though fiance is supposed to be going into the office twice a week which often he doesnt and when he does i have to drop him to the station and pick him up. This means waking up much earlier and dragging the kids along as well as picking him up in the evening again with kids around 7pm. I start work at 8 but Im normally up around 7 due to kids and I take care of everything. I do the packed lunch, make breakfast, tidy up, get the kids dresses, while also trying to work. I also have to work while watching our LB and when I ask for help he often says he needs to concentrate or that he cant work like this we are too distracting etc. Fiance often wakes up at 8.45 and gets dressed and ready to do school run. He used to do it but now Ive asked to do the school run but he insists on coming along. Its quite nice doing the walk together and I enjoy it a lot. He does help out around the house dont get me wrong, he takes care of the garden, he takes the bins out, he does general tidy up of toys or dishes etc. But I feel like Im still doing the majority like the laundry, cleaning, doing the cooking and lunchboxes, bathing and dressing kids, feeding kids, and putting them to sleep. When I try to say this he gets defensive and it always goes the same way, he first says yes he does clean up after me all the time like taking my tea cups away or whatever, and then says oh hes not doing enough even though he does this and that and how Im asking for more constantly. I know we have probably forgotten how to be in a relationship together since having kids and just neglected our relationship while we focus on the family and work. But it feels like we are just very different now and weve grown in different directions. I wish he would do more without me asking. I wish he wouldnt get annoyed with me when I do a quick 5 minute vacuum daily to keep ok top of everything. I wish he was more attentive and take initiative. I am so tired constantly and mentally and physically drained. I feel like Im growing to resent him for a lot of things and Im questioning our life together. I dont know if I love him still, I know I care about him a lot but not sure if thats enough. We have two amazing kids and I dont want to mess up their childhood and life by breaking up the family. At the same time Im not happy and I dont feel like my needs are being met. Hes a good father and plays with the kids and they love him so much. But sometimes I feel he prioritises other things above the kids, like watching sports games he follows. I dont know what to do, I dont know if Im being unreasonable with wanting more from a partner. I want to put the kids first which I think means just putting up with it and accepting this is how it is. But Im struggling to the point where I dont want to get physical with him and I dont know what excuse Im supposed to use. Please help me make sense of my feelings. Thank you for reading my very long essay x",

Eventually towards the end of our relationship, I actually grew out of love and ended up having a thing with my friend. This included platonic talks strictly. When I told my partner about it, he agreed to let me go on the grounds of me agreeing that I cheated. I said yes while technically I was never wrong. A few days ago, and months after breakup when we reconnected for a chat. He plainly confessed to having emotionally cheated on me with several women. Turns out he was simply projecting his problems on me. He would sext and call with them. He maintained several telegram and snapchat accounts for his affairs. All while he asked me to be loyal to him. He made me the villain when in reality he was the villain himself. For 2 years, I was kept in the dark. I loved him with all I had and he said it like I never mattered to him. I dont know how to move on from this betrayal. This wasnt the closure I needed. :D",

Its now working perfectly fine, but I have to pay interest of over 50 on a loan I didnt use in 5 days from now. I dont have legal options, Im in an African third world country and too poor to afford a lawyer. These are loan sharks who will destroy a persons reputation with lies over little money. What do I do? Is there an online gig I can do to get the 98 dollars I now owe? Everyday the interest increases and the app is not allowing me to pay installments. Their customer care agents are just being rude and condescending to me! If I dont pay early they will start calling my contacts telling them Im thief, murderer etc. Any advice is welcome.",

She was like talking bout how hard she worked for her body and how she appreciates me loving her body. She then starts talking bout sorry now Im blushing and cant stop, you really made my night. She then ask if my husband would care bout her showing me her pics, he was walking in and heard her say this and he said what pics and shes like oh Im just showing your wife my body, trying to make her squirm and my husband just laughs it off like its no big deal. I would never cheat on my husband, especially with his sister but like.... Is she flirting with me... This makes me wonder if I should keep my distance bc that got a little wild. She lives on the other side of the state so we dont see her often. What should I do? Im not even trying to be tempted. Like I would never forgive myself.",

If parent 1 can no longer afford it and requests that they use a therapist that is covered through their insurance, but parent 2 refuses to switch, can parent 2 take parent 1 to court for not paying their half? The insurance covers mental health play therapy and has therapists available in the area, parent 2 just doesnt want to use them. Not sure if it matters, but the custody agreement states that they will split medical expenses and then other non-essential expenses they have to both agree on in order to split the cost. Private pay play therapy seems like an elective expense given that insurance would cover it and private pay isnt necessary.",

So the reason why I think he finds me ugly is because: 1 Im afraid to admit it but I lost my virginity during doggy style. So basically to me he found me ugly to look at 2 Hes usually high whenever we meet up He cant be sober when Im around because im ugly? He didnt ghost me after or anything. He actually wanted to link up again which Im okay with because Im not taking this serious its strictly for physical needs, however It does hurt my feelings knowing he may find me ugly Idk, he did perform foreplay before and stayed with me after we did the do. He asked for a hug before he left. But idk i think he just did all that because it was my first time. Im not expecting a relationship out of this but I dont want to continue being sexual with someone who finds me ugly. I even asked him and he said that found me attractive but idk. So is he just being nice or does he find me unattractive?",

He missed the first one but the second basically touched every part of the driver side of the vehicle. Everything was fine with the sheriff and even a friend who was nearby to help until a state trooper drove up. My husband was playing disc golf, had one beer over 4 hours and the trooper was on a warpath to prove he was drunk. Feeling he was simply being targeted, my husband said Ill take any tests but with a lawyer present which didnt end well. The state trooper immediately arrested him, charged him with fleeing an accident he went two miles to find a place to pull over and the scariest part is my son was with him. Were working with a lawyer but Im scared. And dont know the right questions to ask or what we can hope for. He cant lose his job hes in sales and on the road and I know he was sober I talked to him 10 minutes before the accident. How do we best approach? Hope for a plea? This is a tiny town in MS",

    "text": "Im a bit freaked out. Recently, my employer laid off 8 employees while all sales people including me were on a business trip out of state. This time, the laying off included some higher level employees. One of them worked for the company for over 20 years. We are currently rolling out a new system AND moving into a new building combining two offices into one and this has cost us 13.5 million. We are often at the discretion of shareholders, and apparently we are for sale right now and trying to cut costs. Yesterday, they sent out an email called Office List. All the sales people that are getting an office, including those with the same title as me, were in that email. I was not. One of the sales managers responded to the email and included me this was the only reason I knew about the email and said that they forgot about me. The person that generated the email then sent back a message saying, shes already going. Im not sure what he meant by that. A friend co worker of mine just visited the new building today. He said he didnt see an office with my name. Not only that, last week, they sent out a memo to all sales men to use a specific estimating form going forward. I was not included on that email when I should have been. The only reason I saw it is because Im handling the inbox of an employee that quit, and doing his work. Not only that, my boss recently joked that after Im done cleaning up this employees mess the one that quit that Im fired. This was after I joked about a football team that he hates. Not only that, I was supposed to be part of the testing team for the new system. It was announced company wide. We were supposed to receive emails about the testing modules already. I never ended up receiving those emails and I heard that they are testing the system already. Given that Im being left off important, company wide notifications, and there isnt an office for me, and theyre leaving me off the long-term testing team for the new system, I feel like perhaps I may be in trouble here.

    "text": "I have a question regarding a contract and its validity. My son recently left a youth baseball team due to the head coachs demeaning/bullying behavior towards him. It was bad enough for him/us to walk away. Without getting into too much of the weeds here, weve asked for a prorated refund and the coach is refusing to pay us back stating that we signed the contract. When we paid the team fees, there wasnt even a mention of a contract. Six weeks later, we received something called a Parent Contract to be reviewed and signed. We signed it along with some other forms in preparation for the 1st tournament. After dissecting this agreement, it appears it may not even be a valid contract. In order for a contract to be valid, there must be consideration, correct? This contract really is just a set of rules stating that as parents, we will be respectful, bring our child to practice on time, etc. There is no mention of the fees being non-refundable. There is absolutely nothing that mentions what the team/organization is going to do for our son or us in return. Location: Knoxville TN",

    "title": "I am tired of a silent competition with another girl. I want it to stop.",
    "text": "TLDR: My boyfriends brother has a girlfriend who hates me, takes pictures of me everywhere, talks about me with their friend group, and tries to make me uncomfortable every chance she gets. I want the competition to end and dont know how to end it. I 19f have been with my boyfriend, Steve 20m, for 5 years. His twin brother, Barry, is dating Amaya 18f. When they started dating in 2022, we were all in high school. Amaya didnt speak much English, and we never interacted. Barry and I didnt like each other, so I figured Id never really talk to her. A few months into their relationship, Steve started getting weird DMs from an account named ellie, saying things like Barrys with the wrong girl and Isnt Amaya so ugly? Do you think shes ugly? Or do you think shes cute. Barry was getting similar messages, saying hed abandoned ellie and theyd hooked up. It was super weird. I messaged the account and they said Amaya stole Barry from her and would steal Steve, too. Then two more fake accounts started doing the same thing. I got curious and hit forgot password on them to see the email clues, and they all matched Amayas usual username format. Same first letter and two numbers she used everywhere. So yeah, it was her. Barry broke up with her. I messaged her to say I didnt mean for anything bad to happen. I didnt even think it was her and I just wanted to find out who it was. We actually kind of became friends. I used Google Translate to talk to her and even gave her advice about Barry. They got back together, and she instantly stopped talking to me. I didnt reach out either, but I could feel .. weird tension. Shed whisper with her friend, take pictures of me at school, screenshot my posts, and more that I probably cant think of. Now, 2.5 years later, it still hasnt stopped. She had a glow up, even cheated on Barry, and still talks about me. After a fallout with her friend, the girl told me Amaya made fun of my weight constantly and even had a whole album of pics of me on her phone. Amaya will make fun of me with Steves friend. She takes pictures of Steve, too. At family events that I often cant attend because of my busy schedule, Amaya will try to stay close to steve and will poke him or tap him on the shoulder to get his attention. She tries to do this weird cutesy act. Even in front of me, she will hit him and giggle. Steve doesnt reciprocate and tries to stay away from her. One time, I was at starbucks doing schoolwork, and she walked in. She took a video of me, sent it to Barry, and Barry said something on the mic about how I was trying to look cool??? She also very obviously will try to convince me that Steves family is closer with her or something. its weird I literally am just so tired. Theres so much that I cant even explain or put or it would be entirely too long. I literally just want peace, and I dont know how to get it. I cant even go to the gym to workout because amaya has little goonies everywhere that ALSO take pictures of me for her. I just want her to stop. I have thought about reaching out and asking why she still has a problem with me, or if theres something Im not aware of. Or just saying can you stop taking pictures of me and making everything uncomfortable and awkward? we could just be friends. or even just people that get along. why do you WANT to have conflict. why cant we just get past what happened in the past but I dont think thatd go over very well. I just need help",

    "text": "Location: Virginia I have physical joint legal custody with my ex, who is in law enforcement. In past hearings, two different judges acknowledged they could recuse themselves but noted that hes worked with every judge in the courthouse, so l felt it was pointless to request a new judge. Our custody order says Father shall provide notice of his selected weeks by April 20 of each year and he failed to do so. I sent my dates to him around April 21-22well before my own May 10 deadline-and made plans. He has a pattern of ignoring the court order, like not reimbursing me for requested medical expenses and only communicates when it suites him. Im still paying off 20K in legal fees from past litigation and cant afford another attorney, so ld be forced to file pro se if I chose to take legal action. He knows this, which gives him more room to violate the order-especially since I struggled to get fair treatment even with legal representation. If he now selects summer dates after the deadline and they fall on my regular custody time, am I within my rights to deny those dates if I have something planned since he failed to follow the court-ordered deadline?",

    "text": "My boss have been on the industry of web development for more than 20 years and he says that the best thing is to start a project using cursor agent because its all auto generated and really fast. Am I crazy or my boss doesnt have any idea about mantaining a project? I mean, sure, automation can speed things up initially, but has he ever tried to maintain one of those auto-generated beasts? Its like being handed a tangled mess of code and told to just make it work. The moment you need to make even a slight tweak or fix a bug, youre essentially reverse-engineering a machine built by a robot that doesnt care about human readability. And dont even get me started on debugging. Good luck finding where that cryptic, overly abstracted function lives when everything is nested in auto-generated folders like a maze. Am I missing something here, or is my boss just enamored with the word automation without realizing its a one-way ticket to maintenance hell?",

    "text": "Location: Dayton, Ohio. We live in a rural area of Ohio on a farm. My son turned 18 2 weeks ago, junior in HS has a loud truck stock, no after market parts thats designed to pull heavy loads. Because of the small area, everyone knows everyone. While driving through the city limits of the small town nearby he flipped off a lady in her yard because she was throwing her hands up in the air at him. We live nearby but just outside of the city limits and her house is on one of only 2 roads that lead to our home. Shes fussed at him since he started driving 2 years ago for driving fast. We put Life360 and another driving app on to track his driving habits. Im not naive, he speeds, but in that specific area I checked his driving record and he never does more than 5 over the speed limit. She says hes harassing her by driving by her home and revving his engine. She called the police yesterday in the town she lives in and wanted to file a harassment complaint. The police officer came to our home to talk to him outside of their jurisdiction. At first I had no issue, and encouraged him to be honest. But every time the cop asked him a question, shed interrupt him and call him a liar before he could get 3 words out. Like I said, Im not naive, and have no doubt he was being an asshole, but I question if he was breaking any laws. The cop said he sat at the stop sign by her house too long. I tried to explain that it was because he called me and asked me what to do bc she had run out into the street recording him and he wanted to go talk to her. I told him no, to just come home. He was at the stop sign less than a minute. We have a hands free law, so he didnt want to drive and talk on the phone. He was 17 at the time of that incident but has since turned 18. I was trying to interject to explain that the woman didnt like my son and although he was being a jerk, if she wasnt going to cite him that wed handle it. She went ballistic on me and told me she didnt have to speak to me since hes 18 now. She told him hes not allowed to drive near that womans house for the foreseeable future. Is that even legal? Its one of 2 only ways to leave our home. The cop threatened to cite him for having a loud truck, but if its stock, is that allowed? Were in Ohio. He has to have a heavy duty truck to pull farm equipment.",

    "text": "I 24F living in a MCOL area. My boyfriend and I have advanced to conversations about marriage and buying a house. Both are VERY expensive endeavors and I want to know the best way to save up for such events. I would say I am very well off for my age. Net worth over 100k, 6 figure job, no college debt, and no bills besides a phone bill. My boyfriend has lots of student loans, but we want to make paying for a wedding and house as painless as possible. What is the best way to save for a wedding/house down payment without destroying savings? These events would occur in the next 2 years or so. Would investing the money in the market be a good idea to pay for a wedding or should I stick to HYS? I am slightly worried about how expensive these things will be as I have money goals I am trying to meet but obviously also want a fun wedding too!!. I already invest around 3,200 a month into various accounts 401k, taxable brokerage, IRA, HYS, but I could break them up into different savings accounts if needed to help the saving process. If anyone has good tips/advice on saving for these major life milestones, I would love to hear them! Thank yall.",

    "text": "Im 25F I was in a relationship with him like nearly 2 years....I was actually friends with him since tuition days so his mom knows me as a best friend of him....everything was going fine she used to call me to her home and we used to spend time alot like... I was more than happy because we used to talk, go out to eat and stuff, she used to pack me biryani whenever she prepared something delicious weme and his mother with his friends surprised him by throwing a birthday party and it was like a fairytale to me and him because what else do I need more than a MIL who is a chill person....but the story took a u turn when she got the doubt that may be we are in relationship and all....since then she became insecure regarding him that we stopped going out and even being on call when he was at home and like everything man.... She started manipulating him into thinking how these things are not good for future he has to marry someone oneday right And at that time I realized that I used to like her alot and suddenly this behavior of her is effecting our relationship... It came to a point where I can never imagine a single moment of our future together without her.... Im not dramatic guys we both are adults,like in future after our marriage any kind of trips, dates or any simple couple thing I can never imagine without her and when I tried to explain this to him.... I became a toxic gf who is trying to separate him and his mother and I can pinpoint many things man....it was enough for me so I broke up with him but even after like 1.5-2 years after our break up she still calls me sometimes like once in 2 months and we will speak for like hours I dont hate her guysIll tell her all the drama in my life and vise versa.... She asked me like 4 times why we guys are not speaking with each other anymore ... Every single time I tried to divert it and at last I told her aisich aunty vaisa kuch nai hai bolna boletho.... After that she never asked me again.... Right now I dont know guys maybe she likes me as his friend but she cant see me in that place of a bahu and all or I dont know she still calls me whenever something happens In her family What do you guys think about this whole situation?",

    "text": "Location: Massachusetts, USA I need help navigating a credit card dispute involving an international flight I booked through Booking.com big mistake, I know. I originally booked a business class ticket, but after receiving the confirmation, I noticed the flight was in economy class and the layover terminal information was incorrect. I tried several times to get Booking.com to cancel or correct the ticket no luck. I never took the flight. I filed a dispute through my credit card Mastercard via Barclays, and Ive provided everything they asked for: booking confirmations, screenshots, receipts, and records of my communication with Booking.com. But now Barclays is asking me to submit a second opinion letter from a travel expert or ticketing professional on company letterhead verifying that the service I received differed from what was described. Ive contacted multiple ASTA-member travel agencies, AAA, and other advisors, but theyve declined to help since they werent involved in the original booking. Does anyone know: Who I can contact that would be qualified to write this kind of letter? If theres another route to take with the bank if I cant get this letter? This experience has been a big lesson in how weak consumer protections can be under Mastercard disputes. Any advice is appreciated.",

    "text": "Advice Hello all, First, I would like to say that I do not want to be saved or helped. I just need advice. I intend to kill myself. I have struggled with mental health for many years, some of its genetic, however it has been made worse with trauma. Ive been through many forms of therapy, including having graduated from dbt. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and ADD. I do not see the value in living. My quality of life is affected very heavily by mental health struggles, and even through medication, therapy, and being at a better, healthier place in life, I feel stuck. I am happy. I am working hard to maintain that happiness, but thats exactly the issue. I am happy, it got better, Im thriving, but the amount of work it takes to maintain happiness is not worth the benefits. I have retrained my brain, fed it all the right chemicals, constantly focused on bettering myself, and even in the happiest moments, I think of how much I want to be dead. I have a bright future ahead of me, but I dont want to be chained to my mind for a lifetime. Especially with BPD, theres no fix. My brain is broken, permanently, and regardless of what I do, I know I do not want to live like this. That being said, I also dont want to hurt others. I know its going to happen regardless, but I would like to mitigate it. I have a girlfriend of 9 months, and my parents. I love them very much. Would it be less painful for them if I left a note, or would it be better to leave it up to them to interpret it as whatever they need to? Thanks so much.",

    "text": "Yesterday, my girlfriend of two years sat me down and said we needed to talk. She told me that even though she loves me and even though Im everything shes ever wanted in a partner she cant get past our political differences. She said its been eating at her for a while. That we see the world in fundamentally different ways, and no matter how much shes tried to work through it, it keeps coming back. The thing is, I always thought those differences were things we could navigate together that with mutual respect and understanding, we could make it work. Ive always tried to be open-minded and accepting, and I truly believed we could hold different perspectives without it coming between us. But for her, it ran deeper. It weighed on her in a way I didnt fully grasp, and over time, it became something she couldnt ignore anymore. We moved in together in March. We signed a lease that goes through January. I thought we were building a life together. She was the one. I truly believed that. I just turned 30 and I was finally in a place where I felt like I could breathe like I had someone beside me for the long haul. Someone to weather life with. Ive been through dark times in my past, and this relationship felt like the light at the end of that tunnel. I loved every second of what we were building. Now, its just... gone. Just like that. And I feel completely hollow. I dont want to start over. I dont want to date again, go through all that uncertainty again, open myself up just to have it fall apart over something like this. Im lost. I dont even know what Im supposed to do from here. We live together do you think couples counseling could help us? Im really struggling to figure out what to do.",

    "text": "Location: New York, NY This past Saturday night I was buying an item online from a second hand fashion reselling app called Grailed. The seller told me he was removing the item from the site due to overly high taxes and asked if I could do business with him directly via his Instagram handle. I usually would never have done this but it seemed he had a bunch of followers, his name and pictures of himself with other fashion related organizations, and pictures from other buyers confirming successful receipt of items from him. I decided to trust him and paid via venmo with my credit card connected to venmo. We make the deal and he says he will ship it Monday. Thats the last I have heard from him. I also noticed he relisted the item on Grailed and now his venmo account has disappeared. He isnt responding to messages and I feel like Im boned. I know it was a stupid mistake trusting him but that ship has sailed now. What recourse do I have? I have his picture, found his linkedin, and know what college hes attending and likely living in. Not trying to be a creep but figured incase I have to go to small claims court or something. I figured first I can contact venmo and try to dispute it but Im not optimistic they will be helpful. Thank you for any possible guidance!",

I had a puzzle game I was running with him, it was a fantasy game I played with a bunch of friends and it lead to a cool story, so I turned it into a game for him to be a detective and learn about the world and I made up fun prizes at the end and such, but he told me he wasnt having fun with that and now hes displaying the same behavioral patterns as he did then His best friend M28 and me have been hanging out, theyve been friends for 23 years, and I would never hurt him by cheating or anything but Im starting to get a lot of attention from his friend, me and him cant work due to physical disability and health issues and if I didnt have him Id be almost completely alone in this relationship, not trying to be dependent for anyone for attention, and certainly dont wanna go too far with his friend but I need that sort of affection and idk how to bring that up to my boyfriend without him getting upset Im autistic and hes not so communication is a struggle, how do communicate with him? How do I tell him what Im feeling? What am I feeling? I have so many questions",

    "text": "A couple days ago I was sitting down with my female friends boyfriend and he opened up to me about her. He told me that he does not take her serious at all because of her wandering eyes looking at other men and messaging other men on IG. Told me he gaslighted her in the beginning saying she was pretty/a bad girl/you are it since many men are in your DMs/etc because he noticed she needs validation and attention to feel accepted but he stopped after a while because she gets bored easily. He gave me many reasons why he does not take her serious and does not see anything with her in the future. Sadly said you think I will marry a woman like that. He said she is not a relationship type of woman at all. Told me he caught her cheating only two days later when they had a fight/making out with a guy at school with her friend/talking to guys on FaceTime to buy her something and refusing to admit it/etc. Her boyfriend looked at me and said you think I will take a girl like this serious. Said he was just in a bad spot and needed her help him financially because she has been helping him financially so far in the relationship since they met 6-7 months ago. I was shocked and didnt say anything to her when she got back in the car. I kept my mouth quiet and refuse to tell her because I know she will not believe me if I told her. I told her once months ago when her boyfriend opened up to me and said a similar thing but she didnt believe me and went back to him. She once asked me once did her boyfriend ever say anything about her to me and I said no. I only said this because I told her once and she refused to believe me. I feel so guilty not telling her. The crazy thing is I like the guy because he has some characteristics and values I love. I feel guilty not telling her.",

I cant get to see a doctor they only refer me to a and e but its not worth it when all I need really is an assessment or an x-ray just to double check... Im really frustrated right now because I want to be better safe than sorry but during the working week I cant finish at 5pm to then go sit in a and e for 10 hours the walk in clinics are 3 hours wait and close at 8pm which means they would likely have to send me away.... Ugh anyone got any sort of advice on whether I should be concerned enough to go or if I should just give up and hope it doesnt cause me any issues going forth....",

I 17M want to say at 15 I started feeling more attracted to older women mid 30s and up when I started to look at some of the older teachers in a different light. To clarify, Im not meaning in a sexual manner but more of a nonsexual turn on. There are plenty of girls at my school who although they are stunning, Im just not attracted to them. I was raised with morals that my parents instilled into me. Lot of things most kids do I dont really do because I dont see the thrill of it. I still enjoy myself with video games and playing ball with my boys but this is something I cant simply mention to them or my parents because how do you even explain women that close to my Mothers age Im attracted to?",

I have a preliminary hearing in about a week, where the defendant was arrested without bail for harassment against me. I dont know what a preliminary hearing is or what questions will be asked. A woman from victim advocacy was told that Ill be asked to testify, but what does that entail? Should I write up a statement before hand or go in and just answer questions as they are asked? I want to be completely transparent with the judge, but If I was allegedly lol drinking before hand, while not of not of age, is that something that will that harm my statement and/or possibly negate what happened to me?",

I guess I understand that people would find it annoying but I was working on a book to help medical students memorize everything. With memorization tips. I didnt plan on providing memorization tips for cancer because its a sensitive topic. I would just mention the origin of the name. I was writing about how each element is used in the medical field for different conditions and how its used. But I used other words to help them memorize it. Like Tantalite and Columbalite contain niobium. Niobium is used for better drug delivery. I used the memorization key: The Newbie was bullied into doing drugs. She didnt want to get taunted Tantalite for her hair getting messed up by the rain so she bought a light Columbia rain jacket. While my book my help medical students. Im afraid someone with a sick child could become furious. Im afraid if I got sued and had to appear in person my face would appear on the news and I could get murdered. Like if I used a pen name and PO box to hide my identity. I know you might find my idea annoying, but could I get forced to appear in person at court? Location: SC, USA",

    "text": "EGOOO Ego. where do i even begin. Like there is so much to say on it and I still dont even understand it yet. Ego isnt just one thingits the story you tell yourself about every thing. Honestly a lot of people have a huge ego and once you understand it you see it in everyone and everything. You understand yourself in a way you never even imagined was possible. Youll slowly start to get how much they just dont get it yet. Everyone is just as confused and hurt trying to survive in the only way they know how. They have deep issues their ego covers up. Me too. I get it. It doesnt bother me because I understand. For the first time. I get it. Yes I have my faults and a lot of them but I see them I see the things I never thought of before. I feel differently about things. I understand differently. Im aware. I see my ego and I understand my ego. Why i do the things i do. Why do I react the way I react? Im learning to put it aside and be me. Im grateful for the protection but Ive got me now. Im not scared anymore. See the ego is so complex and goes so deep for example when i ask what you think having a high ego is you probably think of an arrogant asshole or some prissy girl. But no its the second you stop being you. The second you let your emotions control you. When you stop doing what feels right. Thats the ego. Your ego protects you. Some are different from others but once you see it you dont stop. You notice it in every small thing you and others do. Every thought. Every movement. Everything emotion you or others experience or have experienced. Everything you or others ever liked. Everything ever said and done. Its everywhere. When you let go of the ego the real lesson is that everything is just as deep as you think it is but nothing really matters. Thats a scary thing to realize and REALLY get for some people but trust me its so beautiful. Im not fully there yet but I can wait. That takes time to get to but its real ive felt it. Ive felt what its like to have that lense shift. On shrooms and sober. I learned how and experienced it on shrooms first with a light visual of a face in the ceiling. While I was tripping, a face started to appear out of the flashing lights. It was an angry face. Frowning and had the brows point down to look like it was mad. I got scared. Like really scared. It felt like it was mad at me. Like it was looking down on me. Like it was about to jump out and hurt me or yell at me. So my mind was racing. I got nervous and scared. Visibly scared. But I looked at it and really LOOKED and saw that it wasnt mad, it was hurt. I seen the angry pointing down brows were actually slightly tilted up at the end and the eyes were softer. I cleared my mind. Put my- ego aside and WATCHED THINGS SHIFT. Watched myself go from scared and protective to empathic and open with just one perspective shift. The ego. Your ego isnt just you not being you it can go deeper. Deep through childhood. Honestly down to one event. Big or small. Doesnt matter honestly, just deep. See nothing matters but its all so deep. You can never get rid of the ego. It is not right and impossible but you can learn to understand it so you can use it not be used by it.",

    "text": "Im 21F and my bf 26M have been together for about 3 years. To make it short and simple even though its not, I started dancing shortly after we got together. He wasnt too happy with the idea but we were living very comfortably, and he was obviously happy with the money. We got a nice place together, we share a nice car.. etc.. until about a year ago in the midst of everything he told me if I continued dancing he wouldnt look at me the same. Which really hurt to hear him say. And ultimately stressed me tf out since I had no idea how hed expect us to continue living our same lifestyle without my income. But I chose him over my job. Since we share a car and his job is very strict, I have to work around his schedule completely which is not an easy task. I switched positions to a door girl at my club because Im on great terms with management and theyre allowing me to work the weird hours but the pay is shit. Now within the past year weve fallen into horrible debt and can barely afford to live. Our lease doesnt end for awhile, so while we may be able to eventually move somewhere cheaper, were still in debt and our credit is going to shit. Ive tried discussing with him that I want our old life back, or at least I want out of debt and can easily fix this problem by dancing again. Weve gone out to strip clubs with friends for fun, and he always has such a great time, but now hes even more against the idea of me dancing again. Ive ALWAYS felt in control of finances and been able to afford the life I wanted, but he threw such a curveball at me and now I dont know what to do. Obviously we need to get our debt and credit in order before were able to get approved for a different place. Ive always been independent and definitely was not prepared for him to give me an ultimatum, especially with me being the breadwinner in this scenario. Am I the asshole if I chose to dance anyways and get us back on our feet? Is he wrong to change his mind in the midst of everything that I worked to get for us?",

I have been with my company for 5 years and have been in my current position Talent Acquisition for 2.5 years. My regional team just for 2 new managers who started about 3 months ago. My manager previously was terrible. Provided zero feedback or professional development. Contributed nothing to my team and didnt help us at all. I heard through gossip that stemmed from a manager who now oversees my team that my previous manager was being transitioned to another team. So I knew a few weeks prior to it being announced that he was leaving because some of these folks are gossipy mother fuckers. For some context: Im pretty good at my job. One of the top recruiters in my department. Excellent metrics and good relationships with my clients. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. One of the managers meets with me ln a friday and proceeds to inform me that they havent seen any development from me in these past 2 months, despite the coaching theyve given me on biweekly/monthly check ins and direct messages. She then tells me that shes spoken to some of my clients and they have given negative feedback on working with me. Which is new to me as Ive been working with them the entire time Ive been in role. She then says that maybe this job isnt for me and i would be better suited for another role on our team. she then mentions a SPECIFIC job and says that they are currently hiring so i could consider that. she tells me i need to either: 1. make the decision to leave or 2. create a development plan for myself in this role by MONDAY. Obviously Im upset but the other role does sound better and honestly they suck as managers and im burnt out. i actually met with the manager for that role and shes so nice and im actually excited for a change. cause this shit sucks right now. and one of my current managers has told me if i stay in my role that its only going to get harder. heres the problem. They gave me a 13 raise LAST WEEK after i was told this job isnt for me for all the amazing and hard work ive done in this role. Im also seeing work being pivoted away from my plate and given to the person that theyre likely going to replace me with. I know some of my colleagues are aware of these conversations because 1. they told me about my previous manager and 2. one of my colleagues told me my potential backfill told her last week that i may be leaving the team. i am absolutely fuming and will be speaking to HR but what else should i be doing? Im so mad. If no one gossiped at all i would have happily left but now i want to stay just to fuck with them. help please :",

For most of our marriage Ive had a much higher libido than her, to the point were we had a life-support bedroom not quite dead-bedroom. Ive been the initiator, and Ive always found her, and clearly expressed, that I think shes attractive and sexy and all that I want in bed. For most of our relationship shes been pretty overweight. Over the last year she has done incredible work and is down 70lbs and is now only classified as 30lbs overweight according to the flawed in my opinion bmi chart. Shes stated that much of her LL was related to body image, which I understand. Shes lost this weight, is feeling better about herself, and is scheduled for a tummy tuck which shes wanted for a long time. Heres the problem. I just dont fantasize about her the way I used to. Not that I fantasize about anyone else! And I dont watch that much porn, so that hasnt taken her place. I think she is super hot but that all-day every-day yearning I felt died a slow death because our bedroom situation. Im so afraid that she is going to come out of this tummy tuck revitalized and Im not going to be ready for her to suddenly have a libido. I know what it feels like to be rejected in bed, and I dont want to her feel that after all the work shes put in for herself. She has always been against sexual counseling, so Im looking for help to get those feelings back. Does anyone have any experience here or have any suggestions?",

Last year I suffered some broken bones and was taken out of the field for about half of our season and then left early to go care for my father going through cancer treatment. In the middle of all of this I found sobriety 5 months tomorrow!, which i think might be playing a bigger role on my mental health? I know i used to drink to avoid processing feelings or to escape the never ending work to be a better person. However, with no actual advancement in my life/ career I feel worthless, i feel like im adding nothing to society. I went from being a wildland firefighter to now a bar server at a pretty shitty restaurant/bar. the moneys great during busy season but at the cost of getting yelled at daily by customers and management. I hate it. i also just hate the job, i feel awful and guilty for taking peoples money just to bring them food/ drinks. PLUS IM SOBER WORKING IN A BREWERY. I got a job offer from a guide company but then Id miss out on weekends with my family, my partner has a big boy job with benefits etc etc so Id rather have my schedule line up with theirs so we can explore on the weekends at least i think?. Im waitlisted at my number one choice for grad school, which hopefully will make me feel more fulfilled since Ill be working towards starting a nonprofit but i cant help but shake this might just be a feeling ill have to manage for the rest of my life because of the way I was brought up. Nothing ever being good enough, there never being a cap on how hard you can work, just never being able to get a job well done moment. Ive been calling this my quarter life crisis, I just feel so defeated and like I will never be able to feel like I felt at 9 years old with joy and passion for life. So yeah if you have any guidance or relatable stories i would appreciate it!",

    "text": "tldr Hi Reddit bare with me this is a long messy story and also my first time ever here Im just so hung up on things! I am desperate for some advice. We are both 20 So. From the start of my relationship weve been together a year with my boyfriend, I have always felt as if Ive put in more effort than he has. he didnt have a job for a good bit of our relationship so I would spend money on us to go on dates or pay for his gas. Which I didnt mind most of the time understanding his situation plus I was the one always planning these outings/dates.. which never changed.. now he also got kicked out of his mothers house for not helping out enough and for not having a job. My family was nice enough to let him stay with us they are usually taking in friends who need the help so we let him stay. He would also constantly talk about how awful his mother treated him while living with her so we felt extra bad for the guy. But while he lived with us he did the same thing he did at his mothers. he didnt help out or clean up after himself unless I had to force/beg him to. he wouldnt plan or ask me on dates and lacked communication skills.. he was also VERY disrespectful to my dad who constantly helped him out and even gave him a new car once his broke down.. now Ive always told him my issues I have with him and he says he will work on them but he only does for a few days and it stops I constantly would have to remind him or force him to just take care of himself or his chores.. its like I was mothering him and taking on all his responsibilities. Now heres where his mom comes into play. We got into a big argument about 3 weeks ago now he left to go stay at his moms for a bit to think I gave him space and was patient i was not the nicest during this weird break because I felt neglected he still wouldnt communicate anything with me. so I would tend to lash out and be angry because of his actions. Not amazing Im aware. I would very angrily tell him the issues I had with him and how I felt treated in the relationship. Now I dont know where to go from here or how to fix this relationship when neither of us can have a productive conversation.. everyone is telling me to leave him but Im attached and still deep down have love for him even after all this how do I go about this relationship now is it time to leave? Thanks for any advice",

Im hurt that he does this and doesnt care that Im working myself to death while he plays video games. I dont understand why if he loves me and our kids why he doesnt want to do more. Why doesnt he try for a better job if he cant get good runs. I dont know how many times I have to leave to come back to the same situation but a little worse everytime.

    "text": "Hi Guys so Im f17 im a junior in hs and ive been liking this guy who is m17 whos a senior in high school. Ive been knowing him since last year because we had class together. Hes my cousins best friend and he was really nice to me but totally not my type. For some reason Ive been having thoughts about him randomly about us kissing and being together. Im not sure I did think he was cute last year for a little but it stopped. I think hes really funny and stuff but looks wise hes not my type. I feel confused about my feelings and hes going to the military and hes graduating in 3 days. He told me I might see him because of my cousin but other that, no. I had a dream last night of us kissing. Im not sure what to do. Why am i so attractive to him but hes not my type. I need advice on what to do?",
