    "text": "Me and my long distance BF have been together for about 10 months and I feel we have gotten very close and that we love each other. When a close relative of mines died about a month ago I was very upset and at home crying. The same night he went out drinking, had lots of fun and completely ignored my texts even though he knew what I was going through. We had a fight about it that night because i was upset and didnt want to talk to him on the phone which he thought was excessive. Now he constantly brings up that night and how much he enjoyed it. Recently I got sick and was in the hospital for a day. After that I went to my parents because i had a really high fever and was in too much pain to be on my own. I went home after two days and he said we would hang out on call that night. An hour later he said he was actually gonna go for drinks and when he got back he just went on about how much fun he had. This happened yesterday. Today he is out with a different group of friends even though we couldnt talk all day bc we were both busy. He normally doesnt even go out that much. It just feels like he wants to avoid having to comfort me since these incidents are the only times he had to my life is calm and steady overall. I should note that he constantly used to bring up how he wants me to lean on him for support and that he wants to be there for me always to help in every way that he can so this should seemingly be important to him too.

    "text": "Context: It was my birthday recently and my girlfriends best friend 28f congratulated me. Im a lesbian and have been with my girlfriend for 4 years now. Ive known her best friend a bisexual woman for just as long. Shes generally an open person whos more the type for casial relationships than comitted ones. My gf and her have had a close relationship to each other for 10 years. They used to spend a lot of time together before I got with my gf and would spend the weekends at each others, shaing a bed and cuddling. But nothing romantic or sexual ever happened between them. Because of that close relationship they had, we often joke that shes my gfs side chick. Theres also some banter like joking about sharing me with the rule of no sex and romantic stuff, bestie complimenting me, and my gf saying that bestie would definitely be allowed to stare at my ass because she doesnt count. The convo I had with my gfs best friend we will call her V in the following text made me wonder though. Is she just being friendly on a platonic level or if theres more to it? Text translated to English for your understanding Voice message from V, where she sweetly wishes me a happy birthday and explains that she intentionally waited until she had time again to send a voice message instead of just a rushed text. Me: Hahah thank you Were just on our way back from city. My day wasnt very exciting though hahah. gf already told me about the plan she originally had with the alpacas. Like, were you seriously considering driving here for 3h just for 1.5 hours of alpaca trekking? V: Uhh yeah, totally, why not? Me: That wouldve been super inconvenient though V: So what Its about alpacas Me: My logic is, that if the time spent somewhere is shorter than the time it takes to get there and back, its not worth it V: Then I wouldve just crashed at your place for a night. But things turned out differently anyway. And come on, you and alpacas are totally worth it. Me: You suck-up V: I have no reason to suck up. Just accept that people like you Me: Never! I really cant tell if Im interpreting too much into this what do you think?",

    "text": "Context: It was my birthday recently and my girlfriends best friend 28f congratulated me. Im a lesbian and have been with my girlfriend for 4 years now. Ive known her best friend a bisexual woman for just as long. Shes generally an open person whos more the type for casial relationships than comitted ones. My gf and her have had a close relationship to each other for 10 years. They used to spend a lot of time together before I got with my gf and would spend the weekends at each others, shaing a bed and cuddling. But nothing romantic or sexual ever happened between them. Because of that close relationship they had, we often joke that shes my gfs side chick. Theres also some banter like joking about sharing me with the rule of no sex and romantic stuff, bestie complimenting me, and my gf saying that bestie would definitely be allowed to stare at my ass because she doesnt count. The convo I had with my gfs best friend we will call her V in the following text made me wonder though. Is she just being friendly on a platonic level or if theres more to it? Text translated to English for your understanding Voice message from V, where she sweetly wishes me a happy birthday and explains that she intentionally waited until she had time again to send a voice message instead of just a rushed text. Me: Hahah thank you Were just on our way back from city. My day wasnt very exciting though hahah. gf already told me about the plan she originally had with the alpacas. Like, were you seriously considering driving here for 3h just for 1.5 hours of alpaca trekking? V: Uhh yeah, totally, why not? Me: That wouldve been super inconvenient though V: So what Its about alpacas Me: My logic is, that if the time spent somewhere is shorter than the time it takes to get there and back, its not worth it V: Then I wouldve just crashed at your place for a night. But things turned out differently anyway. And come on, you and alpacas are totally worth it. Me: You suck-up V: I have no reason to suck up. Just accept that people like you Me: Never! I really cant tell if Im interpreting too much into this what do you think?",

I try not to but it just slips sometimes. Ive been in therapy for 9 months working on anxiety and trying to come up with healthy coping mechanisms. Now- recently my mom told me My therapy has been taking rather long. Shes paying for it And she accused me of taking advantage of my anxiety and not wanting to get help. Shes a holistic healer- were talking gemstones and singing bowls. Shes offered to help me with my anxiety a good handful of times and Ive declined every single time. I just dont believe a stone is going to help me cure my mental state. Ive explained to her several times I just dont WANT to and anytime I express this she lashes out at me saying Im just choosing to be sick. It triggers me beyond belief. What do I do in this situation?",

Hes helping me with a few things currently and I asked him if he was interested in trying again and he said not right now. We are currently speak but I am thinking of going no contact, is this okay to send to him? Hi his name. I feel like after you have helped me with these we should do no contact. I cant keep talking to you anymore it hurts too much. We can still have each other on social media and every so often we can message each other and catch up but for now unfortunately I can longer talk to you. Maybe its not meant to be or maybe it is meant to be just later down the track. If you want too you can take your clothes that you have here home today or they can still be here up to you. I hope you have a fantastic life and I wish nothing but the best for you. I hope youll find someone who will take care of you and give you all the love you need, whether its someone new or if its me later down the track. Thank you for an amazing time together, it was truly special and I will always cherish our time together. Im sorry we couldnt make it work right now and I am sorry for everything. Best of luck in life, you deserve the world and so much more.",

Im always attracted to people Im not in love with, while everyone seems to find their soulmate. I feel lonely every day and in despair, though Im physically attractive and people do ask me out sometimes but you know, its always people that Im not interested in. So, there is this guy who I thought liked me or was at least interested in me. At first, I said, Not my type, right?... riiiiight, so I just ignored it. Then just a week later, Im head over heels for no reason. So much that I thought he did some kind of spell or witchcraft. Im so obsessed with him. I found myself chasing him, sending him Instagram requests I wont stop obsessing and sending hints for him to make a move. But nothing. He does nothing. All he does is stare and smile. His female friend stares at me weirdly. I dont know what to do. Should I give up? Dont tell me to go and ask him out its impossible. I would have a heart attack before doing so. Should I give up? It seems like all my life is about giving up and giving up. So Im thinking of making a move, but my friends told me that I did enough he needs to do something or I need to move on. He is one year younger than me or he ditched a year .",

I dont want him to quit his other jobs just to focus on this, i dont want to control him, all I want is a stable financial future for myself, and i cant do it by myself with this business as I just dont have the experience or connections and heavily rely on my father, and i argued with him about this multiple times with him just saying dont disrespect me or im busy with other stuff, it just hits so hard when the time or day comes when im waiting for what he said hed do and hed always postpone it, not by a day or two, by a week, month depends on how persistent i am, its tiring and its affecting my relation with him, so please how do I deal with this?",

    "text": "I 20F have been in a long-distance relationship with a guy 21M who lives in Australia while Im in uni in the U.S. At first, things seemed genuinehe love-bombed, promised to teach me what love is, and made me feel like I was finally safe emotionally. But over time, things started unraveling. I caught him texting and talking to 8 other women while we were together. Some of them told me themselves. He denied it at first, then admitted to it in parts, but always with an excuseI was just being friendly, I didnt know what I wanted, or I was scared. I chose to stay because I thought he was changing. He even deleted Snapchat and other girls from his socials to prove it, but only after I caught him. This week, he told me he couldnt talk because of a power outage in his building. It didnt sit right with me. A friend nearby said there was no outage, so I checked Ausgrids site, traffic cams, and even called businesses under his apartment. All of them had power. No one reported any outage. This wasnt a misunderstandinghe lied. Its not just about cheating or one lieits the pattern. He gaslights me, minimizes my emotions, mocks me when I cry, and turns every hurtful thing into a joke. But then hell follow up with I love you, pookie, and expect everything to be fine. I need help figuring out how to move forward. Ive invested emotionally, mentally, and spiritually into someone whos shown me time and time again that honesty, loyalty, and care arent priorities for him. How do I walk away from someone who broke me, but I still feel attached to? How do I grieve a future I thought we were building together when it was never real to him? Any advice or clarity would mean the world right now.",

    "title": "My dads house reeks of dog piss and I dont think I can live here",
    "text": "Im 25 years old and I just graduated from a law school in Missouri. My plan was to stay at my apartment in Missouri while I studied for the bar, however, the tornado that hit last week completely destroyed my apartment. Roof caved in, debris everywhere, its chalked. My dad offered for me to move in with him while I study for the bar, and since I was already considering living with him during my clerkship 1 year working for a judge for experience before working at a law firm, I decided to drive 15 hours back to my hometown which is where I want to practice law. However, my dad has two dogs and has never trained either of them. They completely run the house. The smell of dog piss has seeped into the bones of the house. Its not like they do it in one spot either, its everywhere. If you stay inside long enough your clothes will start to smell like it. I knew that this was a problem before I came here a couple days ago, but it was much more manageable the last time I visited about a year ago. Now its completely unbearable. The house is just completely unclean in general. Its pretty big and hes been living alone, so when he cleans its a very light clean and its usually only in his room, bathroom, and kitchen area. There are also several mice in the house, meaning there is mouse shit everywhere. Ive brought this up with him several times, but he always just shrugs it off, deflects, and downplays how bad it is. I dont think the problem will ever be addressed. I have pretty much no money right now and wont until my clerkship starts, I certainly cannot afford a new apartment right now. The tuition, bar prep course, and recovery from the tornado cleaned me out. I can occasionally stay at my aunts house, but its not somewhere I could live full time and I dont think Id be able to study there very well. I could also move to my grandmothers house, but there are two problems with that. 1 She lives 12 hours away far away from the rest of my family and friends, and 2 I also dont want to hurt my dads feelings. Hes done a lot for me and hes been excited for me to move in. I just dont know what to do and would appreciate any advice.",

    "title": "Im jealous and dont know what to do",
    "text": "Me 15 F had a crush on my friend 14 F for four years now. Since the day that I met her she seemed like the only person in the whole world to truly like me, but unfortunately for me it was only platonic love. We often had long talks and laughed together. I loved to imagined us together. If only I told my feeling sooner maybe I wouldnt fall so low in the stupid friend zone. I never told her because I never thought about myself even being worthy of her love or any love at all. So, About three days ago a girl wrote to her about wanting to be with her or like just get to know her same thing for me. The girl was somebody I really despise to this day and now I hate her even more. So my friend and the girl were really hitting it off, like talking nonstop all through these few days. Though it seems that the girl carries most of their conversations because my friend is a huge introvert. I was really surprised when she showed me how much she actually talked with that girl. Of course I acted really supporting of them though I was screaming mentally and stoping myself from breaking down in that place. The day that I heard they were talking to each other I wanted to believe that maybe my friend didnt really wanted to talk to her but she told me that she did takes to her with her own will. She does want to be with that girl. She was so excited to show me their messages. I really believe that the girl is truly fake and changed partners every month, so I said it to my friend but she just brushed it off. I really love her and its definitely not just a normal crush. I would die or kill for my friend. I would do anything for her, ANYTHING if she asked for it. That girl, responding to my friends question said that she likes her because shes pretty basic and she doesnt stand out. The girl also said that she likes those kind of people because they have better personalities and a lot of hidden quirks. How could she even dare to say any of that. First of all my friend isnt basic shes the prettiest person on this whole stupid planet and I would never lie about that. And second of all that girl is literally standing out the most with her damaged short pink wavy bob and dark clothes. Im really fricking jealous of that damm girl. Shes so lucky that somebody like my friend likes her, though its probably only because my friend never probably was flirted with. So after three nights of falling to sleep crying I decided to turn to reddit for any advice on what should I do. If I should do something or just let her go, or maybe even wait and see what happens. Theres a small chance that my friend actually sees this post, shes a HUGE reddit addict. So maybe, just maybe if you see this and dont like me back just please dont say anything to me I really dont wanna ruin our friendship. But just know that I love you. I do.",

    "text": "So i am 18F will be 19 in 2 months and i am currently in my hometown living with some relatives for a few days. I came here to avoid the clash at home so for context my parents are alcoholic and drink pretty much everyday then they verbally and physically fight with each other. We are also very unstable financially and thats why i am in my 2nd drop year because they cant afford to get me into college. My father does not work a permanent job so minimum income on his part and he spends it drinking and to give moneylenders whom he owes money ,he doesnt care about me or my studies and my mother,who i thought cared about me,internally hates me because according to her i dont work around the house and i dont know how to cook but she never lets me cook never even taught me and when people told her that your daughter should know how to cook by now shed get offended by them. So i did come here for a few days and honestly wanted to return home but for the last few days i have been here they are still drinking day and night at home and i dont wanna return to a house like that where i am constantly under stress. I told my grandmother on my moms sideshe recently got to know abt the situation when i told herabout the current situation at home and how i am living in my hometownfathers sideright now so she asked if i wanted to start working and live with them but i said id think about it. Because i do wanna work but i dont want to live with any of my relatives especially not at my grandmas house because that will give my parents the reassurance that i am safe and well fed off but i dont wanna give them that satisfaction of knowing about my whereabouts so i am trying to look for a job for 12th pass away from the town i live in but i cant seem to find anything. Honestly idk what i should do at this point should i just go home and suffer? or should i start working and live by myself somewhere else? or should i live with my grandma? every situation has its downside i dont want to go home because i honestly cant take it and i get so depressed there but if i start working and living alone then there is no backing out ,i will not be able to afford college by myself and i dont wanna live with my grandma they live in a very remote village area with little to no facility also they are very poor so i dont wanna burden them and if i do live with them my parents will not worry about me because they would know that i am safe just like i am here and they are rest assured that i will come back home. what should i do? need advice on how to move out and live by myself?",

    "text": "Hello, for context Im a 31F working in the IT industry in the PH for almost 10 years. I specialize in Frontend Development for almost 6 years. I was originally a Fullstack Dev entering the IT Industry. But I am very blessed to be able to stay in a company for 6 years and specializing in a work I really enjoy. Never have I thought in the 4th year specializing in FE development, Id be promoted to Senior FE Dev. The last few months of 2025 was, to say the least, stressful. I didnt want to sound ungrateful since the job market in my industry has been having a difficult time to stay afloat. But my company has good benefits, offer good compensation and is a full-time WFH. I prayed for this job and God gave me the opportunity to be part of it. But with the recent new management has soooo high expectations for Seniors, they expect to adapt fast, perform above and beyond, and they should be able to always focus on the clients needs. I understand that- but as someone who is not a ROBOT, I get tired too. To unrealistic expectations, to managers who say I am here to help but there are no results, to planning that instead should have been the leading of the manager, falls into other devs shoulders then when expections are not met, throws the team under the bus. Ive also express this multiple times with multiple other managers that I am specializing in FE Dev because thats what I wanted. They always insisted that I should persue to being a Fullstack Dev instead. Which I didnt like- but none-the-less I was open to be taught. The Fed up part is they say they are willing to teach me but since Im a Senior dev it should be easy and fast for me to capture the lessons. Like I should be able to help on backend issues and i should be able to deploy a project with similar expectations to those who work on them. And Im just so tired, Im not enjoying work anymore, and since our client was a developer, he insists that everytime he has an idea to do things better- we should instantly implement them, and he keeps on saying unrealistic deadlines like, We have to do the unit testing now. It can be coded in a day. or something of that sort. Working there made me question if I was really worth the Senior role because I cant keep up. I resigned from that company, tho. Everytime I clock in, I cant help but doubt myself, my talent and skills. And I always feel the dreadful weight on my chest that results to anxiety and panic attacks. I found a new company, the interview went smoothly. Im starting there next month. But heres the catch and the title of the post comes in. The new company offers Frontend Engineer title. No Senior title. If you ask why I accepted it, because it offers higher than I get from my previous company, but with a responsibility I am willing to give my abov and beyond. I feel really excited, even their managers sound good leaders and based from a friend they are. But to those who can give me advice or answers, whether youve been in a similar situation or anything... Id really appreciate your answers. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this long post. Have a blessed day. Will having a Senior FE Dev to FE Engineer title hurt my credibility for future jobs?",

    "text": "First I will give you some big context My highschool organises each year a Model of United Nations, 3 years ago, I was invited to be a graphic designer for them withoit being paid ofc. I accepted because I needed the experience and those diplomas for my university admission. I worked like a horse basically, and at the end, I was told that I need to pay to attend the party, and is free only the organising team...which I was part of, but aparently not enough. I did not attend. This year, my best friend was part of the organising team for this year edition, and asked me to work as a GD , she knew how much I hated it but she said it wont be like last time cause rn she is part of the team. I accepted, only for her, because I knew how important it was for her. I told her: yea well I hope I will be treated fairly and also be invited to the party this time haha she said obv dont even worry about it I got it. Fast forward, this is my final year, I had to balance my university admission, with studying for the finals and also their event. I worked hours for their designs. The event has started 3 days ago... 1. I wasnt invited for the opening ceremony she told me she thought I wouldnt be interested 2. My badges were not used they didnt tell me anything about it, or that they did not like them, she told me she knew nothing about it 3. SHE FORGOT TO INVITE ME TO THE PARTY WHICH WAS YESTERDAY. I found out about all of them because of their insta stories. Safe to say I am super mad and...sad, I did not expect this from my best friend at all. She apologised for it but only after I texted her and ranted about it. Now...we are supposed to move to the netherlands in a few months, she is my best friend, is the first time we have such a fight, but I am honestly so dissappointed and I dont know if I should forgive her or not. I do not want to lose her, but at the same time, I accepted to help only because of her and she forgot about me totally, I am so hurt right now and I dont knoe if our friendship will ever be the same. What should I do?",

    "text": "A couple days ago I 23 f started feeling pain in my vulva.. the pain became unbearable and I noticed a lump. At this point I could barely walk or sit down. I went straight to urgent care, where the nurse told me I have whats called a Bartholins cyst, which is a blocked duct in the vulva that got infected. I guess a sex accident I had resulted in blunt force trauma, which caused it. she referred me to a gyno to get it taken care of. That night I was in unbelievable pain and couldnt sleep or move. Even rolling over felt like an impossible task. it had gotten worse somehow and I started crying , which woke up my boyfriend25m .. he ran me a bath and made me soup the bath helped a bit. I guess he thinks he has tonsillitis and his throat was a little irritated not painful or anything, just felt off , I got pretty annoyed that he was spending so much time complaining about how his tonsils looked, while I was all red and crying about how scared I was and how much I was hurting. I didnt mention that I was annoyed, but I was. I reassured him that hell be okay and explain tonsillitis to him Ive had it for years so I know a little bit about it eventually I found some leftover pills from a previous injury and was able to sleep. Then today I woke up, immediately took some Tylenol and called the gynecologist that I was referred to. The receptionist said that before I could make an appointment to take care of the cyst, Id need to book a separate new patient appointment I was told the earliest I could be seen was late next month. Yeah, absolutely not. After I hung up I started sobbing because I didnt know what to do. My boyfriend took a half day from work and we decided to go to the ER to have it taken care of because I couldnt handle another day with this pain. The ER staff was so helpful, and although I was a little difficult needles and scalpels near my vagina give me a little anxiety they took care of me. My boyfriend was mostly playing Fortnite and Pokémon on his phone, except for when I was struggling to allow the nurse to give me a numbing shot in my vulva. He joked that hes giving me the childbirth treatment while playing Fortnite, as if I wasnt in a situation that required him to be attentive and sensitive. -For a little context - I was a victim of some abusive medical malpractice by my childhood dentist and was actually involved in a winning lawsuit against them, so when it comes to needles and things I tend to get really upset. I told the nurse beforehand so she didnt take it personally.- My Bf told me not to look at the needle and to just let the nurse do it, and I told him that I feel better when I can see whats happening. He argued with me on this for a bit which annoyed me a lot because I really just wanted support instead of criticism. My nerves were already shot and the nurse had to step out to give me time to calm down. After she came back, my boyfriend had to take a call outside of the room and the nurse was able to give me the injection, I watched her do it too. The nurse was so patient and understanding. When it was time to actually cut me open I requested that he and my mom who had just shown up with food for me, thanks mom step out. I didnt really care that my mom was there a whole lot but I didnt want my boyfriend to feel singled out. The nurse and I made small talk while I watched her drain my cyst and it went smoothly. I went home to sleep and my boyfriend went to work. After his shift had ended, he brought me flowers and some pizza that I had requested, but he seemed a little off. I told him that I felt like he was upset and I asked him if hes okay and he said hes just tired, which I understand! He was awake the night before, since I had woken him up at about midnight and he didnt go to sleep until about 3am. He woke up early-ish to take me to the ER around 9am and then went to work. But when I asked for help with my bath Im still in some pain and moving hurts he asked if he could go sit town and I made it more known that I felt annoyed. I told him that I appreciate him taking care of me, but it felt like it was annoying to him and I was frustrated the day before about the tonsil thing, because it felt like he wasnt making it about himself. It took me a while to shower and soak because Im moving pretty slowly, which is fine but I feel like such an inconvenience to my boyfriend. Im tired too, even though I took a nap, I was and am currently in a lot of pain and I wish he didnt seem so uncaring. Hes asleep now as I type this. He was just so attentive before we officially started dating this month. Now he is constantly playing phone games and he cant seem to be in the moment without some kind of entertainment. I know we are always together but even when I try to watch a movie with him or watch TikTok he usually has his phone out too. Hes been really into this Pokémon game that he plays, but its nonstop and I feel like if I dont engage first, hell never stop. I use my phone a lot too but I also really like the moments that we have where its just us, or were doing it together. Even directly after sex hell be right back on his phone. Im probably being overly sensitive and grouchy because of how much pain Im in, and I dont know whats on his mind. Maybe Im being short with him and I dont realize it, maybe hes offended that I wanted him to leave the room at the hospital? Im not sure. Im anxious that he will just get defensive if I try to talk to him. Id appreciate any advice on this. What should I do if I do decide to talk to him and he just gets mean?",

    "text": "The story of Flowers for Algernon is about an incredibly stupid man. Hes so stupid that he doesnt know how stupid he is. He works in a factory the other guys at the factory make fun of him for being so stupid, and yet hes so stupid that he doesnt realize that hes being made fun of. He can barely speak English, which is conveyed through consistent spelling and grammatical errors. One day the man is approached by a scientist, who says they have an experimental procedure that will make him incredibly smart. He takes the offer, and moves into the lab. He meets the procedures first test subject, a mouse named Algernon. He watches Algernon solve incredibly advanced puzzles puzzles for more advanced than what a mouse should be capable of. He begins his own procedure, and gradually he becomes more and more intelligent. Not only does he master the English language, he becomes fluent in other languages. He masters mathematics, solves puzzles to perfection, essentially becomes one of the smartest people of all time. He goes back to the factory his coworkers cant believe that hes even the same person hes let go for being overqualified for the work. But then he gets news that Algernon is losing her wit. He begins to wonder if the same will happen to him, and sure enough it does. He becomes frustrated with himself, not being able to think to the same capacity that he once could. This progresses until he reverts back to his former self. The only difference: he now knows how stupid he is, how stupid he always was. He lived his whole life before the procedure in contempt, with no knowledge of what he didnt have. Now with that knowledge, hes empty hes full of sorrow. I had to read this short story for my 7th grade English class, and it was the very first piece of literature to make me cry. What I didnt realize at the time was that this story would be an allegory for my life. My whole life I never really formed close relationships with anybody. In all of high school, I saw my friends outside of school a total of 3 times. It was easy for me to blame that on the fact that the friend that lived closest to me lived about a half hour away, and I couldnt drive for most of high school. In college, the only times I got invited to things were if it was something sent in a big group chat. I was probably invited specifically and individually to things twice in college. I never got any texts from my friends, the only time I really spoke with people were at large functions or organized events. This was all I ever really knew, and I was contempt with that. That was until I met her. We matched on tinder, had a very brief conversation about what music we liked, and then we said wed both be going out that night, and then hopefully wed bump into each other. And bump into each other we did. It was at the ΣΝΧ house, they were playing music that we had both said we really liked earlier, we danced for a while, then we crossed the street to the ΩΒΨ house. We continued dancing for a while, my friends were across the room cheering me on. Dancing in the Moonlight started playing. During that song, we very slowly got closer and closer until our lips were touching. Suddenly, we were the only people in that room, there was no music, the only thing in the world was me and her. It was my very first real kiss, and it was the most magical moment of my entire life. She asked me if I wanted to go up to the bars with her. I knew full well that both the bars in town were closed at this point, but I said I would love to. We made the 20 minute walk up, and on the way we found that in addition to liking the exact same music, we liked the exact same sports teams, the same tv shows, shared a lot of the same interests. We got to the bars and found unsurprisingly that they were closed, but coincidentally, her house was right around the corner. We went there, we put on game of thrones, one of the shows we talked about, she tried making a move but I declined first because I had no intentions of having sex with someone that I wasnt certain was special, someone that I didnt for sure see a future with. Second, out of fear that this would turn into a one night stand, something I had no intentions of doing. And third, because she had been drinking, I dont drink. It felt wrong and immoral. Later that week, I took her bowling, our first real date, she invited me into her house again that night but I declined. I bumped into her again at a party the night after, and she slept at my house. She tried making a move again, and at first, I declined again. But as she lay in my arms, I realized how happy I was feeling how happy she made me feel, being there. I realized that she was indeed special, that her in my arms was exactly the future that I wanted. She made a second move that night and I caved. It was my first time and it was fantastic. From there we started texting every day, we started going on frequent dates we went hiking, we went to the mall, we went out to dinner, we went to sports games. I brought her to my rugby date party, we did a couples Halloween costume, she had a record player in her room, and she would put on one of the records that we both loved. I saw her almost every day. Every time I opened a Snapchat from her I had a mini mental breakdown I couldnt believe that I was seeing this beautiful girl who genuinely wanted to talk to me, I couldnt believe I was so lucky, it didnt feel real. During class I started leaving my phone out on my desk, just in case she texted and somebody happened to be looking, they would see a notification pop up with her name and a heart next to it. My average phone usage dropped from about 8 hours a day to about 2. I didnt wanna waste time looking at social media or YouTube or whatever, I only wanted to see her. If I found a movie I really wanted to watch, I would decide not to, because I wouldve rather watch it with her. Not only did I see a future with this girl, and not only could I see myself marrying her one day, but I knew exactly how I would ask her if that time ever came. I realized that for the first time in my life, I felt genuinely happy. Even my friends saw me like a different person. One of my friends told her upon meeting her for the first time, that me having her was his essentially his first glimpse into my life. I hadnt really realized until then, I never opened up to my friends about anything, until I met her. Because for the first time in my life, I knew what love was, and I knew what joy was. But that all changed when she went away to her brothers school to visit for a weekend. While she was away, I noticed she wasnt texting me as frequently as she usually would. I figured it was probably no big deal, shes probably just having a great time with her brother. But then when she came back after that weekend, things didnt change. She would send me one, maybe two Snapchats a day. I didnt see her once that whole week. I was beginning to lose that newly discovered joy. Eventually, at the end of that week, she asked me to come to her house, and she explained that things were moving too fast for her, and that she didnt feel ready for a serious relationship. Only to see her posting on instagram a month later, a picture with a different guy. After digging deeper I saw that shed liked every single one of his posts since 2019, implying that she had a history with him, perhaps an ex boyfriend. And further that that I saw that this guy went to the same college that her brother went to. The same college that she visited the day that she stopped talking to me. I realized then, that she lied about the whole thing. She mustve gotten back together with her ex on that trip. I started to wonder if any of the feelings I felt were even real. Or if she just kept me around and used me for sex until she could rekindle things with this other guy. And then lied to me about doing so. That night that she ended things with me, I wished her the best of luck and walked home I cried for hours. And then I cried every single day. For about 7 months. And then I still continued to cry about her every once in a while since then. Because I lost that love that I had in my life, I lost that joy. I was returning back to my old state that I used to be contempt with. Only now I wasnt contempt. Because I realized how empty I was, and with that came my first real experience with genuine sorrow. I was visibly less happy around my friends, and if asked about it, I wouldnt be able to open up. I couldnt listen to the same music anymore, it just made me sad. Everything I did became meaningless, because everything I did before was for her. Just like the man from Flowers for Algernon, I went my whole life not realizing how empty and alone I was, then I had a brief experience with love, just enough to fully realize what I never had, and then lost it, and was left with the despair of the knowledge of what I dont have, what I never really had. Im writing this because its now been over a year and a half and I cried about her today. I still just feel so empty and miserable, and hopeless, that Im never going to feel that love or joy ever again, because why should I? If the girl I put my absolute everything into, the girl that made me feel like I was on top of the world, the girl that I wanted to give the world to, didnt actually feel that way about me, then why would anybody? That feeling of being happy has become the single thing that Ive come to strive for in life, and yet, it just doesnt seem feasible.",

    "text": "I just need advice. So over two years ago I had an llc. I ended up never using it. I had no business knowledge and thought I didnt have to file taxes for something I never used. I went away for training, came back and saw that I owed the irs over 2000 total for each quarter that I never filed my taxes. In a panic I hurried and paid what I owed. I felt like this was crazy since no profit was made and I called only to find out the amount were estimates and I shouldnt have paid it. I shouldve filed then it would be recalculated to what I should actually pay. I spent almost a year moving states for work and trying so hard to get my checks. Went around in circles with the irs. My llc was closed and I finally got my checks and opened a chase business account to deposit them. Not realizing I was still using my personal account and both accounts were not linked I did it on my personal account. When I caught the error I reached out to chase to stop it and they said they cant and I have to wait to see what happens within the next business day. They then texted me to call them or theyll close my account. I called and explained what happened. Now my account is restricted, my business account is restricted as well. Its probably gonna be another year in circles to have those checks resent, the irs cannot send my checks in my name instead of my business name and opening a business account at another bank requires a physical certificate for my llc which is back home in a suitcase locked away. Im so frustrated.",

    "title": "Is my friend 28f being flirty with me 24f?",
    "text": "Context: It was my 24f birthday recently and my girlfriends best friend 28f congratulated me. Im a lesbian and have been with my girlfriend 27f for 4 years now. Ive known her best friend a bisexual woman for just as long. Lets call her V. Vs generally an open person whos more the type for casial relationships than comitted ones. My gf and her have had a close relationship to each other for 10 years. They used to spend a lot of time together before I got with my gf and would spend the weekends at each others, shaing a bed and cuddling. But nothing romantic or sexual ever happened between them. Because of that close relationship they had, we often joke that V is my gfs side chick. Theres also some banter like joking about sharing me with the rule of no sex and romantic stuff, V complimenting me i.e calling me pretty, but not in a omg gurl you so pretty way, and my gf saying that V would definitely be allowed to stare at my ass because she doesnt count. So you see, we have an open way of talking and making me nervous with banter like this seems to be enjoyable to both my gf and V I enjoy it too, dont worry. Considering that context, the following convo I had with V made me wonder though. Is she just being friendly on a platonic level or is there more to it? Text translated to English for your understanding Voice message from V, where she sweetly wishes me a happy birthday and explains that she intentionally waited until she had time again to send a voice message instead of just a rushed text. Me: Hahah thank you Were just on our way back from city. My day wasnt very exciting though hahah. gf already told me about the plan she originally had with the alpacas. Like, were you seriously considering driving here for 3h just for 1.5 hours of alpaca trekking? V: Uhh yeah, totally, why not? Me: That wouldve been super inconvenient though V: So what Its about alpacas Me: My logic is, that if the time spent somewhere is shorter than the time it takes to get there and back, its not worth it V: Then I wouldve just crashed at your place for a night. But things turned out differently anyway. And come on, you and alpacas are totally worth it. Me: You suck-up V: I have no reason to suck up. Just accept that people like you Me: Never! I really cant tell if Im interpreting too much into this what do you think?",

    "text": "I 32F just told my husband 34M that I have a 13-year-old son back in my home country, and now he wont speak to me. I hid it out of fear and shame. How can I fix this? Throwaway because my husband and some friends use Reddit. This is not a post I ever thought I would make, but Ive hit a wall and really need advice. Please be kind. I know I made mistakes, but I also didnt feel like I had many choices at the time. Im originally from a conservative, rural area in Southeast Asia. In my country, especially in the region and community I grew up in, getting pregnant outside of marriage is not just frowned upon, its considered a deep stain on your familys name. The word shame doesnt even begin to cover it. Girls in my town who got pregnant unmarried were sometimes disowned. Some were forced into marriages with abusive men. A few just disappeared, moved away, sent into hiding, or worse. In some extreme cases, there were whispers about honor-based violence. One girl in the next town over died under uncertain circumstances after her pregnancy was discovered. Everyone knew what that meant. So when I got pregnant at 19 by someone who had no interest in being a father, my parents went into damage control mode. We told the extended family I was sick and sent me to live with an aunt in another town until I gave birth. My son was raised by my parents as their own. I was told, lovingly but firmly, that I needed to move on, build a future, and keep this part of my life private forever. I didnt argue. I was scared and ashamed and young. A few years later, I got a scholarship to study in the U.S. I left. I told myself it was for him, that Id work hard, send money, and one day maybe find a way to bring him here. And I did. Ive supported him financially ever since. I call regularly, I visit once a year. He knows Im his mom. He calls me Mama. But no one in my American life knew about him. Then I met my now-husband. Hes American, open-minded, kind, supportive. Weve been married for three years. Hes never been to my home country and doesnt speak the language. Hes asked a few times about my family, but I always gave vague answers and told him my parents were traditional and private. He never pushed. I never told him about my son. I wanted to. But I was terrified. Not just of losing him but of everything it would mean. I told myself it was too late, that Id tell him eventually. But eventually never came. Until last week. I finally told him the truth. About my son, about my past, about everything. I told him I was sorry, that I was young and afraid and that I was trying to survive the best way I could. He didnt yell. He just said, So I never really knew who I married, and walked out of the room. Since then, hes barely spoken to me. Ive been giving him space, but Im afraid Ive ruined everything. I dont blame him for feeling betrayed. After all, I did lie by omission. But I didnt do it out of malice. I did it because where I come from, my sons existence could have cost me my life. I want to fix this. I want to be honest going forward. But I also understand if the damage is done. TLDR: I come from a very conservative culture where having a child outside of marriage is dangerous. I hid the fact that I have a son from my American husband for years. I finally told him, and now he wont speak to me. I dont know how to earn his trust back or if its even possible.",

Recently my sister came to visit me I live in a different state the whole time she spent talking about her bf and complaining about him and just being negative. I told her I was fed up of it and after that she was passive aggressive with me. Long story short we ended up getting into a really bad physical altercation. She started it by slapping me in the face which I thought was crazy. She also embarrassed me at a bar by getting aggressive yelling and grabbing me by my shirt. We have not fought like this in years and Im about ready to cut my toxic family off for my own peace. Always seems when I think things have changed it turns bad. I no longer want to deal with the immaturity. What do I honestly do? I honestly feel so hurt and sad about not having a healthy family dynamic. I have to walk on eggshells every time. No longer can I take the disrespect.",

My dad is a pretty toxic guy, so I didnt know how to love properly. I was not shit. I treated her bad, and last year she left me. I still think about her, I started to date other people, to cover up the wound that was left. Maybe I could move on from her and meet someone better? But no other girl compares to her, I still compare her to them, and I just want her period. I want her back, and I can never have her back. I want to move on, she left me for another guy, and good for her, shes happy. I wish I can just stop missing her. And I cant seem to love someone cus they are not her. Because if I could choose any girls out of all these people, it will be her, it will always be her. She is my home. But my home is gone. And Im just miserable inside, so lonely and empty, longing for someone whos far gone. And I have been participating in hobbies, working my ass off, and its a good distraction, but I still want love too. Not any love tho, I want her.

    "text": "Last year, my dentist created a crown on one toothtwicebut both crowns came off within hours and were completely unusable. Later, he admitted he couldnt place a secure crown because the tooth was too short. Ive been living without a crown since then. I asked the dentist to cancel the charge, but he refused. Last month, I disputed the charge with my credit card company, and they ruled in my favor after reviewing the case. However, this week I received a payment demand letter from the dentist, which states: If I dont pay by the end of the month by cash or check, he will add interest, Previously applied discounts will be removed, The account may be sent to collections. This has made me extremely anxious. If the credit card company resolved the dispute in my favor and reversed the charge, do I still have any legal obligation to pay again? And if I ignore the dentists threats, is there a risk to my credit? I submitted a complaint to the CFPB today, but Id really appreciate advice on how else I can protect myselfespecially my credit score. Should I consider hiring an attorney? Thank you in advance for any insights or similar experiences.",

    "text": "Hi! Okay so I just recently turned 18 and I still live with my parents for details. Okay so my mom sometimes goes in my room when Im not in there, like to clean it or check if Im in there. About a year ago I bought tarot cards and hid them under my bed cuz my mom is very religious and would be mad about them. About 4 months later then I looked under my bed and couldnt find them again. I thought I misplaced them maybe. I checked my room for them 20 times since then. Have not been able to find them. I honestly now think maybe my mom found them and got rid of them without saying anything. About 3 months ago I bought myself a mini like bullet-vibrator type thing that looks like a lipstick though possibly plastic and fake without the lid on but I have some kids toys left from my childhood it slightly blends in with so its still not that suspicious unless you look close and I used it I think yesterday or the day before and Im 95 sure I put it somewhere and now its not there and also not on or near my bed where I used it. My mom is very conservative so maybe she realized what it was somehow and threw it away? This makes me very angry. I dont have a job yet and cant move out. I bought it with a little spare money I saved up slowly. Which I no longer have. Im now pretty sure she may be getting rid of the things I have she morally dislikes for some reason.",

    "text": "Over the last two months we have been fighting frequently atleast 10 days a month. Some over not picked up messes from the both of us, some over disrespect towards each other. We had a massive fight two weeks ago that led to her going to stay with her mom over the Mothers Day weekend where she was telling me to get out when I was telling her that I couldnt anymore with her attitude towards me, inevitably after hearing her yell at me to leave repeatedly so since my names on the lease I yelled back at her that its my place too and legally Im responsible for it. She left and come that Tuesday shes back and after about 10 days of it we are back to square one where she wont even communicate with me about what I did wrong. How do I go about coaxing her into actually talking to me so we can work this out? Because every time I try I either get hung up on, ignored, or told to leave her the f alone. Im just tired of the fighting. I dont have the energy for it, soooo whats the best course of action to move forward with this relationship or is this non salvageable?",

I still convinced myself he loved me at some point cuz I can tell his affection when he looked at me. And I cant help looking for other white guys to fall in love and turn out the end all the white guys just wanna exchange nude with me. I check my Snapchat wish have pure and genuine conversations and all about sex chat. I admit that I always wanna be with white. But somehow on any dating apps they just wanna do the sexual stuff. Why is it so hard to move on? How I feel I am drowning in this kinda pathetic cycle? I thought if I can find other white guys then things will be different, everything gets worse. Just wanna have a real love in real world I really wanna ask how to meet awesome white guys?",

    "text": "We recently started migrating one of our Chrome extensions from JavaScript to TypeScript. Its a tool that deals with Google Meet data transcription automation, but this post isnt about the product its about the why behind the tech shift. Our main goals: Improve maintainability: the codebase has grown, and tracking the impact of changes became harder. TypeScript helps enforce structure and clarity. Stronger typing: reduces runtime bugs and makes module boundaries more explicit. Better UI scalability: were planning more advanced interfaces and want to use TS-native libraries. Faster development: autocomplete and static checks speed things up, especially as more devs join the project. If anyones curious, Id be happy to chat about real-world TypeScript benefits beyond idealized tutorials and the practical trade-offs during migration. P.S. The MVP was in plain JS - but with the product growing, we needed something stricter and more reliable.",

    "text": "Just for context I suffer with anxiety, My girlfriend has been ignoring me for nearly a month now , it all started when I started overthinking every little detail and asking for reassurance ,avoiding me when were out , never messaging and ignoring every message I send her , though she is fine with speaking to both mine and her friends normally yet Im an exception, its getting to the point I stress about it daily and harm myself about it but when I ask her for help as usual she ignores me , though when asked by a good friend of mine she says she still loves me and wishes to stay with me , of course I understand that she has a personal life and things arent that great sometimes I wont go into detail but everyone Ive spoke to about it says that a month is absurd , I love this girl more than anything, and I never wanna give up on her , but I cant keep going like this , though with the way my mind works I could be overreacting , what advice would you have ?, thanks",
