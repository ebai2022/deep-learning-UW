    "text": "I have been with my GF for Two 2 years, weve been in LDR for that much also, but when I had the time I visit her from time to time. Were always talking on traveling to places, joining travel agencies for travels, etc. But she also opened up that she wants to travel alone, without me. For her to experience life more. I dont know what to feel. I needed an advice on what will I think on this matter. Is the problem lies with me if she just wants to enjoy life that much? That I should trust her and know that at the end of the day, she wont replace me with another? I know I may have been wrong in mindset here, thats why if ever you have advice for me, Im gladly willing to accept it wholeheartedly. Im always cheated on and left alone, thats why I have an abandonment trauma. Thank you for reading this.",

    "text": "So this guy 22M and I 23F have been talking and seeing each other for quite some time and he brought up once that he isnt comfortable with me having a lot of male friends. By a lot I mean 6 which I counted just now. Two of them I know from college and we hang out together once every few months, we dont send messages, only for when we make plans which are as I said every few months. One is a friend who he had met and they the guy Im seeing and my friend are very good friends, and my friend had introduced us actually, I have known that guy for 13 years. One is a friend I know for 3 years, he had feelings for me once but I never felt the same way, I am not attracted to him in no way, shape or form, because he isnt what I want out of a person romantically, but he is a good friend, we arent in contact that much anymore. One is a police officer who I met a few months ago and I want to enroll into police academy as well so we keep contact only about that, we dont chat about anything else. And the last one, I see him as my brother, we met last year when I was working far away, but havent seen each other since then because I dont work there anymore and I dont plan to. So this guy Im seeing said you have a lot of male friends as like it bothers him, which I can understand, but I dont know how to explain to him that if I wanted to have something with those people I already would have. I wouldnt touch those friends with a pole I mean in a romantic/sexual way. I just dont know how to express myself and put faith in him that I dont see them in that way and that he doesnt have to worry about that. I dont know if I worded everything correctly, I apologise as English isnt my first language.",

In some cases, attackers may: Add a hardware security key to the Gmail account Change all recovery options phone, email, backup codes Lock the original owner out entirely Then use that access to drain wallets from Ledger, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. If something like this happens, where should someone begin? Are there trustworthy cybersecurity experts or firms that can investigate potential malware, SIM swaps, or home network breaches? What are the options if recovery codes are lost and Googles account recovery flow isnt working? Is there a way to escalate account access recovery? How can someone safely check and clean their devices PC, iPhone, network to ensure the threat is gone? Are there investigators or services that specialize in crypto theft or account takeovers? This isnt just about moneyit can be life-altering, especially if savings are involved.

    "text": "So, a bit of backstory. I was mostly raised by my aunt and uncle. They have two children of their own. Theres a lot of trauma to unpack there but Ill skip out on that for today. Point is, they always treated me differently. Dont get me wrong, my cousin,their son also endured his fair share of trauma from his dad physical abuse which I was subjected to as well, but I feel like I got an extra layer of everything. I call my cousins my siblings,so Ill refer to them as that from this point forward. I grew up feeling like I was the real life Cinderella,before the ball. I was basically the maid, I was the only one who was forced to cook, clean, wash clothes hand washing because washing machines arent common in my country etc. I was always told that its because Im a girl, its my place, no man will want me etc.However,my sister, their daughter, has never been made to do any of that stuff. Shes 15. By the time I was 7, I was already expected to cook for dad uncle do dishes, clean etc. My sister was praised recently for being able to make Mac and cheese because shes never cooked anything in her life. It feels like a slap to the face. My brother also wasnt made to do any of this stuff because hes a man , hell become a sissy its not his place. I on the other hand was taught how to do the stuff that was considered manly because they were skills that are valued. Really,it was just so that I could do his usual work when he left for college. That brings me to todays events. His parents always send him money for rent, utilities etc and he has a job which pays him more than I get at mine. I receive nothing. Once in a while, theyll send him money to share with me, usually 100 dollars that were supposed to split 50/50. Every single time,like clockwork, he makes up some excuse saying he has to pay for this or that, or that his bills are more urgent. Im so fed up. He rarely ever gives me what hes supposed to and Im struggling a lot, barely making ends meet. Meanwhile, he buys a new pair of shoes like every two weeks, new clothes etc. Today,I just settled for him giving me a lesser amount, because Ive been waiting for him to give me this money for close to a month. The money in question is the money that my dad uncle had sent me as a gift for getting an award at the cancer clinic I volunteer at. He sent 200 dollars and said we should share. In the end, I settled for 40. I feel so bitter right now. Its just not fair. I feel so dumb for being so upset about this because Im an adult, but its just neverending. MY award money ended up being HIS and he even got upset about when I confronted him. He basically gets 800 dollars every month from his parents, while I work my minimum wage job, and barely scrap together money for my rent. And he gets paid about 600 every two weeks. As if thats not enough, his parents always praise him for being great, same as my sister meanwhile Im told that Im lazy, ungrateful etc. it hurts because I try so hard. Ive always worked hard in school, had the best grades, won multiple awards, worked hard at home, and barely got any recognition.Its not even like I have reliable parents to lean back on so theyre all Ive got, and I just have to be okay with the way Im treated and smile through everything. I spoke to a counselor at my university once , and gave her most of the actual details of my childhood, and it made her cry. She put it into perspective just how bad it really was, and although this is something trivial compared to everything I endured, I just feel frustrated and kind of resentful. I just wanted to get it off my chest because I feel like Im going crazy half the time. My brother cousin and I are the same age by the way . So reddit, am I going crazy? Ill be taking this down after some time, in case he has reddit and recognizes this story, but I want to hear other peoples opinions.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, Im in a little dilemma and I need advice . I 23F am in a relationship with 25M since 3 years. We have quite a beautiful relationship, which contains a lot of talks and check ups and everything involved. We have never had a serious fight before , we always manage to talk about it and solve the problem together . But heres the thing .. I think that its not enough It sounds so fucking stupid but there are factors that I demand for an example flowers . Im desperate for flowers . I freaking love flowers and every time I pass a bouquet or any kind of flower I am starting on it , with the hope that hell finally buy me a flower. It doesnt need to be a bouquet or anything expensive , even the tiniest little daisy would make my day , my week , my whole month . But nope . I have expressed myself pretty clear and said to him I would love a little flower here and there . Nope nothing . But anyways thats not about the flowers . I feel like something is missing . Even though he is really sweet , I cant joke about everything with him , I cant be overly dramatic because he takes everything dead serious. I have diagnosed ADHD and I know its difficult to deal with but Im also trying my best to fulfill his wishes . Since Im a pretty loud person as he would say. I try to talk calmly around him , because I respect that it overwhelms him. Every now and then theres a misunderstanding between us and it always ends up hurting me quite much . I have always tried talking to him but it gets quite tiring to always have the same conversations about things you have clearly set boundaries. I always respect his side of the conversation because its as important as mine. What am I supposed to do ? Talk again ? Have a conversation where we clearly see the issue ,say that well do it differently , and then it will fail on another topic ? I dont know , is this supposed to be happening? Is this common in relationships? Am I just too much in love ? Do I try too hard? Im sorry if its quite the journey to read through it , its my first serious post on Reddit and I had a text prepared with what I wanted to say but I choose to write it from the heart and memory , so Im sorry if it sounds complicated. I would be really happy about advices and please try to be polite",

I dont want to be racist. Im scared. Im scared to admit it which is why I say I think Im racist. Please help me. I need advice on what to do or read to be better. I know I dont deserve it but please help me. I cant be this way I just cant. I grew up around racist and I just cant take it anymore. Please help me. Edit: Just want to clarify I would never actually say anything racist to a person of color because I dont want to. I just dont understand why Im saying it in my head about them. It stresses me out and its hard to live my life/focus on things. I always keep correcting myself. I try so hard to distract myself and I try not to look at people of color or think of them ONLY because Im so scared my brain is gonna call them a racist slur. Edit2: I havent done this all my life. I dont agree with what Im saying in my head at all. I will say no one in this world is a racist slur and doesnt deserve to be called one. Im starting to sing the its bitsy spider in my head because Im scared my brain is just say a racist to just to say it which it has been and also sing it when a person of color pops up in my head because Im terrified.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend started dating Sophomore year and now we are Seniors. We have gone through some rough patches and I know what people say about young relationships. I really believe I love her though. We have problems but normally we get over them. There are a few that I dont think we can get over which is why I dont think our relationship will work. First off my want for sexual stuff is way higher than hers. This leads to going two months without anything and I feel a loss of connection for me while she is doing perfectly fine. She gets all of her wants such as kissing, back scratches, skin to skin touching, making out, etc. This means that I provide her all of her wants but I feel left out since my sexual desire is loads higher. Her response to when I brought it up last time was reassuring me that her sex drive was the same as mine so I blew it off. This continued on for a little bit before I recently brought it up again and she understood. She proposed a compromise but I still felt shut off about it. I dont want her to feel forced to do that stuff with me because I want it more often. It is like every time she wants something she will get it because I do too. Every time I want something it is a 50/50. She has also asked me to not watch porn which is reasonable. I think it is unfair though to restrict me from getting my desires outside of us because I barely get them fulfilled. So I come to ask about whether or not this has a chance to work in the future. I just cant keep going on like this. Is there any way to help this?",

    "title": "Reconnecting with my 30F former supervisor 37NB?",
    "text": "TLDR: I had a flirty relationship with my former supervisor. Nothing ever happened technically. I broke it off and said I thought we had problems with boundaries. Now Im thinking about reconnecting. Is that a bad idea? How would you handle it? I 30F just finished a grad program. Two years ago, I did an internship for my program where Cat 37NB was my supervisor. I loved the internship and planned to apply for a job there after graduating. But, I was worried because my relationship with Cat was flirty, on both sides. It didnt feel like it was just for fun, it felt intense. It affected the way Cat supervised me, and our coworkers noticed and made comments. I didnt understand the boundaries - Cat wanted to see me outside of work, including alone, which I wouldnt if I were them. I felt confused about the whole situation. I really liked Cat. I didnt want to mix something romantic with work, especially while I was only just getting started with my career. I wasnt sure if anything inappropriate was happening. I looked to Cat to set the boundaries, but they didnt do that. After my internship ended, we kept in touch a little, and the same thing continued. It wasnt clear if this was mentorship, friendship, or if we were going on dates. Nothing inappropriate ever happened. The worst part was when I started a new internship. Cat was on sabbatical and theyd previously worked with this organization too. So they started volunteering there. We didnt talk about it ahead of time. I didnt even tell them about my internship, they heard from someone else. At volunteering, they were super focused on me, wanted to see me as much as possible. I could feel them staring at me around the office. Once, our boss essentially told them to leave me alone. Cat got pissy and said Youre lucky to have her. I was feeling really stressed out. Two of my internships had gotten really weird, which wasnt a good look for me. I didnt like that I wasnt getting a lot of choice - if Cat asked me out, I could say yes or no, but instead they were popping up at my internship. I was also having all kinds of weird, anxious thoughts about what Cat would do, because I didnt understand their decisions. At the same time, I knew I could ask them to chill out, but I didnt. It was the opposite, I was giving them a lot of positive signals. I still liked them a lot and I wanted to see them - I just didnt like how they were going about it. Plus, a large part of me still wanted everything to be kosher so that it wouldnt affect my career path. Eventually, I had to do something. I was really unhappy with both Cat and myself. I told Cat over text that I needed to stop talking to them because I thought we had problems with boundaries, and I needed to focus on finding a job and finishing school. Cat said they respect my boundary, they support me taking whatever space works best for me, and theyll be here if I reach out in the future. I asked if they want to talk about it more and they said no. I probably shouldnt have done this over text - I wasnt sure how they would take it, or if I would lose my nerve. So that was that. I didnt apply for a job at Cats workplace. I did get an unusual email inviting me to apply, with a strong tinge of desperation. I was pretty sure that was from Cat, but I cant confirm it. I got a job lined up thats similar to what Cat does, but at a different organization, which Im happy about. I did lots of other things and finished school. Lately, Ive been thinking about Cat a lot. Basically, wondering if we could be on better terms now. Either as friends or romantically. I really did like them. They apparently really liked me. My main concern was about mixing my career with that. I was also uncomfortable because I was seeing Cat as an authority figure. Thats not relevant anymore. Of course, I dont know whether Cat is open to it, but I guess I would find out. My question is: Would it be a bad idea to reach out to Cat? And if so, how?",

There was no real evidence, but his attorney told him the prosecution would have a field day with this type of claim if he tried to fight it and recommended he take a plea bargain for a misdemeanor in child neglect. This was years ago. The child is six now and he has split legal custody, but officially he does not have split physically custody however, we do more taking care of her than the mother. She has also been living with us as if we had split custody since she was one, although not officially through the court system. My question is, how do we proceed to make all of this official? My husband is constantly bending over backwards for this ex wife, adjusting his schedule, taking his daughter to and from school, etc. just to keep peace because he doesnt legally have joint physical custody. Will the judge really not allow her to live with us officially although it can be demonstrated that for years her safety was not compromised despite this charge? Location: Las Vegas, NV.",

Ive spoken with my husband many many times about the promises he made when we were long distance, we met on amino when we were 13me and 15him and started dating, by then our brains were already impure but mine was off the rails my libido raised higher and higher the more I got older. I dont know how to bring it up that my brain is telling me to do things I could never think of doing nor do I know how to dismiss those thoughts, Ive tried begging him, pleading, and even tried to get some kind of reaction out of him, I dont want to seem like Im forcing him or trying to coerce him but now that Im writing this I feel guilty. I have other objects to help but I dont like them because they dont feel right, they hurt. Is there any way to bring this up to him or fix it so the thoughts and urges go away? TLDR I have a libido that wont go down and Im having thoughts and dreams about me cheating on him with other people Id never even attempt to be with and I just want the thoughts and urges to go away.",

    "text": "My bf and I have been dating for just a few months, and the connection has been incredibly easy up to this sticking point. We both love a mix of outdoor sports, particularly mountaineering. He has more time invested in it however, and has climbed most of the peaks in the mtn range closest to him whereas I live further away and have yet to climb in those mtns. I leave on a big climbing expedition next week so will be apart for a month, and we were scheming good trips for my return. He is excited to share some of his favorites, but in mentioning and showing pictures of one mtn it has become obvious to me that almost every woman he dates makes the trip at least 4 exes. Id like to climb it at some point, but think there are lots of other interesting peaks and would rather share a novel adventure than feel like Im being guided. So when he suggested that mtn make the list for the summer over text, I told him bluntly I wanted to share a new experience and not repeat a trip hes done with most of his exes. Conversation quickly escalated to him saying that then we wont climb anything he has done with a romantic partner before. I recognize Im being somewhat petty wanting original adventures, but blacklisting everything hes done with an ex feels like an extreme reaction. I dont feel like I need to apologize for sharing an honest preference, but he sent my phonecall to voicemail and has stopped replying to texts. What is reasonable compromise? TLDR:",

    "title": "I25f cant stop thinking about him21M",
    "text": "A few nights ago I25F went out with my friends for dinner, we ended up going to a bar/club later. There I met him21M through a mutual, and we ended up having a nice chat Ill refer to him as K. My friend asked him why he was single and k goes on to tell how he values relationships and has to give it his all when hes in one and expects the same but nowadays people arent like that so he just hasnt met anyone worthy enough. And I was just listening to all of this and I was quite interested because that is exactly what I look for in potential partners as well. Hes so much younger than me and Ive never dated anyone youngerIve been single for a year now, coming out of a 5 year long relationship. So later he looks like hes showing interest in me, I was feeling quite cold and he holds my legs and puts them above his legsnow Im giddy. My friend keeps talking to him and I cant quite hear what they are saying so I just sip my drink and chat with the other guy thats sitting next to me. K calls me closer and he asks me if Im uncomfortable that hes talking to my friend too much and I say no, I mean weve only just met each other but I do want him to chat with me, then he tells me that if i am, then I should let him know, all I have to do is just tell him. Meanwhile down the table I just move my leg and then a few seconds later he pulls my legs on his again and just like rubs my leg as in assuring methis happens like 3-4 times. He looks at me and tells me not to overthink while hes listening to my friend talk. Later when were talking I ask him how he thinks I should upgrade my style and he says that hell lmk when were sober, he keeps saying that we should meet when were sober and I said that theres no way we will be meeting because him and I are too different and also we live pretty far, he wants to know why we cant meet. So then he asks me how he can assure me because he can see that I dont believe him. Later on he even calls his friend over to introduce meI thought that was kinda sweet. Later my friend goes to dance and I accompany her, he comes too. But I end up going back to my seat, I can see him looking over at me, so he comes over to me and asks why I am not joining, and I tell him Im not drunk enough to. So he asks me if I want to walk outside, and I say yes he tells me to grab his phone and come out. I do. We go on a walk and hes buying cigarettes, we sit out for a while and I tell him that a one night stand is not what Im looking for and that Im a homebody and that night out was totally impromptu. Anyway we end up making outI went feral, he kept on telling me that its okay if I dont want to do it. After were done making out we sit for a while he keeps asking me what am I so worried about, I tell him that I feel like youre going to make me regret this and he instantly takes my phone, link our social and then saves his number. He tells me that I can call him up anytime and that hes been completely sober and hes ready to meet me later on. Since I was holding onto his phone I can see that he has a lot of missed calls and notifications so I ask if hes involved with anyone else, he opens his call log and shows me that all of it is from his friends and people who he works with, theres also a girl name and I ask about it and he tells me that shes just like a sister. He leaves the bar before me cause he has work at 11 and said he needed his sleep so I let him go. But he was polite enough to come and ask when Ill be leaving since he had to leave at 3, but by that time its already 4something. So now its already two days and he hasnt contacted me yet. What should my next step be?",

    "title": "Different perspectives are welcomed. Need family dynamics opinions- 36M, 31F",
    "text": "Hi, me and my husband met through a matrimonial site in India. He is merchant navy chief officer. We started talking in May 2023 and started liking each other. Eventually, he tells me that he doesnt have a home and right now lives in a home in rural Punjab, his father passed away in 2013, and since then he is the one who is taking care of his family. About his family, he has a brother who stays in Canada and was supposed to be married to the same time like us. My husband immediately after engagement takes a big loan to make to construct a new home in Amritsar city. For that reason, my wedding was delayed by one and a half year and he was always sailing on ship. We were barely able to talk 20 mins some days because of very bad network. However, he started saying that he is making this home for his mother while his brother is not well settled in Canada. Also, he will bear the expenses of his brothers wedding while my brothers fiancé wanted to do her masters in Canada. We dont know if hell be able to send any money for this home or not. But since to make this home, he has used some of the parental property, 5 percent of total construction cost, and that was their only asset, he says this home is for his mother and brother. After our wedding, he only stayed with me for two months and then immediately left for ship again to take off the remaining loan for this home. I just dont know if Im right or wrong, but I feel misused in the entire situation because instead of thinking for our future, he still wants to make a dream home for his family even when its me who has to live alone. All my communication with him has always ended up him telling me that his mom and brother did everything for him, so they can never be wrong. I have also seen some interference from my brother in law who is 31 and not a small kid and his wife on how we should do things in the future. Any takes on it?",

    "text": "My mother has a Universal Life Insurance policy with about 50,000 in the fund value. Due to the rising cost of insurance, its becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the policy. On top of that, my parents are really struggling financially, and it seems like partially surrendering the policy is the only option to access some much-needed funds. The problem is, I understand that any surrendered amount would be considered income, which could trigger a tax liability andmore importantlyreduce or eliminate their government pensions like OAS and GIS. My parents currently have zero income aside from what they receive from the government OAS/GIS, so its essential to maintain their eligibility. For context, my parents combined net income for 2024 was around 36,000 mostly from OAS and GIS. Im not so sure about the GIS maximum eligibility for couple. Id like to know how much more can be withdrawnif anywithout losing GIS entirely, or if a policy loan would be safer in the short term. Would really appreciate any advice or similar experiences. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here. Ive been living in Canada for a little over two years now. During my first year, I struggled quite a bit with English, but over time Ive become more comfortable with the language. My main challenge at the moment is making friends outside of work. I have good relationships with my colleagues we exchange gifts on holidays and sometimes they help me practice English but that connection stays mostly at work. When I try to arrange to meet outside work, people often seem busy or just forget. A little about me: Im a woman with dark long hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. I wouldnt say Im especially striking, but Im not unattractive either. I have a calm and polite personality and always try to treat others with kindness. Ive noticed that other women often keep their distance, and while some men show interest, its usually not in a way that feels like genuine friendship which is what Im looking for. I just want a friend to occasionally grab coffee or hang out with, but so far thats been difficult to find. I wonder if its my English skills holding me back, or if the issue lies elsewhere. Id appreciate any thoughts or advice",

    "text": "My24F boyfriend 27M has a female bestfriend 27F of 10 years. They are highschool friends. I have been in relationship with him for one year. He tell me about her after three months at that time We just started doing long distance relationship. We were in person only for three months. Initially he said its platonic friendship, when I was not okay with having close Friendships with opposite gender. She is attractive. The day he told about her, was when he was in video call with her. I was at my home. He is at his place and She is in different city. He sent a screenshot of videocall with caption My girl to me and I became so angry. Later he told me he was focused in call and didnt complete what he was going to write and didnt notice what he sent. He is forgetful like that, I know him. So I let it go. After a month, He went to trip to her home. She lives with her parents. I fought with him a lot telling not to go. Because staying at home of a female friend was weird for me. They accomodated him in different room. But still, That days I was panicking. After fighting a lot on this matter, I finally agreed to him to book flight. Because He really needed a vacation and he was going through depression. Also, flight cost to her city is very less and to my country is huge. So I said okay. He called me daily and updated me. Sent me pics and videos. I had told him that I have a problem with my man having close female friends. He is from western culture. I am from Asian culture. So there is this culture clashes. He promised me he wont hug her when they meet. But when they met, his friend 27F hugged him and Knowing that I had panic attack. Later for 6 months, whenever she texted him or called him that leads to a fight. My situation at home was not good. Because my parents is not accepting my boyfriend and I was literally fighting for him. I was physically, mentally and emotionally abused by my parents. All I had at that period of time was my boyfriends support. Due to continuous fights with parents, and due to fights regarding female friends, I started developing suicide temptations and made three attempts which I am not proud of, it was dumb. Knowing that He sent to me to psychologist and is supporting my therapy financially. From diagnosis, Psychologist identified that my entire personality is developed based on fear, fear of abandonment and I have emotionally unbalanced personality disorder and Anxiety disorder. At the same time, my boyfriend has depression due to work. We realised we both need to work on ourselves and we were supporting each other. I thought If I became friends with his bestfriend 27F, Then I will be able to get rid of this. So, I texted her and we had one video call. She is soo pretty and we talked really well. She understood my problems. My boyfriend 27M was not replying to her texts on that time, and she shared her worry with me. So I made him call her and talk to her. I was feeling so happy that I finally get rid of that. But that call was so long that it also took our daily call time we have fixed call time for us because we both have works. I started panicking and texted both of them I am having panic attack and can they please cut call. They did it and She told me she will take a break from him for sometime and I should by them try to work on self-heal. I agreed. My boyfriend 27M was annoyed at me due to this. When she was not in picture, We both were so happy with each other and no fights. But then one day at morning she called him it was at time of our fixed wake-up call. My bf texted me she is calling him. I thought I healed by then. But I started developing panic attack. So I texted both of them, begging to cut call, because I cant handle this panic attack. Then my bf cut call telling her that My gf is feeling bad. I should go and she his bestfriend got mad. She texted me rudely with bad language with curses. And that intensified my panic attack. My bf was seeing my panic attack as we were in video call. I was not able to tell anything at that time due to it. After sometime I became okay. And This time my bf was calm with me because he really saw how this affects me and know its not something I can control on my own. For note, I never had panic attack in my life and it started with his trip to this mentioned friends home. He is honest and transparent with me. I trust him. But I dont trust her. She was in a relationship at first. But during the period she gave me to heal myself, she broke up with her boyfriend. Then she started texting my bf telling that she broke up and other friendly stuff. I was fine hearing that. My boyfriend shares everything with me. But he did something dumb dumb according to me, he didnt realise it was dumb. After she broke up, one day her another male friend admitted his feelings towards her and she got shocked. She called my boyfriend and discussed about it. My bf casually mentioned her that he too had feelings for her in past this is new info for me, he told me it was not love, its like oh maybe I like her like that and she was shocked. My boyfriend is introvert. So he didnt tell anything to her about this feelings all these ten years and after he fell in love with me, he doesnt have any feelings towards her. But his reveal of past feelings made changes in her behaviour and this morning call that led to my panic was after that. Also, To maintain transparency, He gave me his social accounts and he had mine as well. The idea was mine and he agreed to it. I noticed that its her who is connecting with him a lot and he is not even replying to around 90 of her texts or reels. He is a person like that. He only replies to me everytime because he knows his absence affects me. I have to ask him to reply to even his family members I have good connection with his family. I saw a reel sent by her thats indecent and also another reel with text on it telling that I am not thinking of you all day and night. I am thinking of you af night only. Fact is that He never noticed these reels. He also got surprised seeing that. I let it go. After the panic attack I had due to morning call of her, My boyfriend didnt text her for a week. I asked him to text her, I dont want them to lose their friendship. She was mimicking him telling that Oh you wont reply to me because your gf said so but in fact it was him who decide not to do it. I have to ask him daily to text her. He did it finally after a week of convincing. And they called and she mocked me mocking in funny way how I send Please stop call during panic and he laughed. My heart broke... I texted her that night telling that it took me a week to convince him to text her again and all I got back was mocking from her and its okay maybe she is having problems in her life like that and she didnt reply to me. Later once we were in video call, she texted him calling sweet nicknames. I knew she call him that because I had his social media accounts. At that time, I was okay with that. But after finding out these kind of reels she sent to me, and her rude behaviour towards my panic, I couldnt bear this. So I told him to text her to keep boundary. But he didnt. So I told him she was disrespecting me and making fun of me before. He didnt stand up for me I can understand because he is a kind of person who avoid conflicts and he only have few friends so he doesnt want to lose them. I told him I dont deserve this and I am going to stand up for myself. I texted her. Telling to not call him sweet nicknames. This only time I did it in harsh way. Before that I was begging or talking in humble way because Deep down I knew its due to my insecurities and trauma and she was just being a reason for its revealing. She called me crazy and talked to me in disrespectful way again. So I confronted her telling about the reels she sent and she didnt admit that. She even lied to me telling that latin american people call their friends papi and mi amor she never called him that, she was telling this to show how nicknames she calling him is harmless. She blocked me and I blocked her. She called him and was really annoyed about it. She made fun of my religion too. She is Islamophobic. since she blocked me, she didnt see my replies to her offensive comments, and it was nagging me. So I sent her the remaining messages from me from another phone number. And she saw it. I just needed her to see my remaining messages. Also, after my boyfriends casual revealing of past feelings to her, One day she sent him Islamophobic reels knowing that He is trying to convert for me. Its his decision to convert. Before we begin our relationship, I made it clear with him that I cant marry anyone who is nonmuslim and he immediately told me he will convert for me. But since conversion for marriage is not allowed in Islam, He is learning about Islam to get actual faith. She had asked me about this matter in our first video call when I tried to become friends with her, and she knows that I wont be able to marry him unless he converts. Honestly, My boyfriend didnt see the flaws in her or red flags in her. He only see mine. I have flaws and I am working on it with help of Psychologist. I have improved and my boyfriend itself told me that there is improvement. I know I have to let her go. My boyfriend told me not to ask about her, because he is fed up with pattern of fights in name of her. He made it clear to me that he dont want to lose her friendship. He told me even though its small he has a boundary with her not telling anything sexual. She is still single. Talking with another man, trying to be in relationship. She had once told me that its nothing new to her. Because her male friends once they get into relationship became distant from her, because of their girlfriends. She has not even see their girlfriends. And she doesnt know why they behave like that and its first time A girlfriend is calling her. Since I was being polite and I wanted to be friends with her, I didnt tell her why its like that even though I understood. She is so clingy and hugging.and so sexy and attractive. She doesnt know about boundaries and gets shocked when some of her male friends admitted their feelings to her. By now, from my boyfriend I know that all of her male friends admitted their present or past feelings to her. Still, she is clueless. And when I ask her to maintain boundaries, she is disrespecting me. One thing I do with my boyfriend is sending all screenshots of whatever talk I had with his people. Because I want him to know the dynamic between us. And he saw that disrespect she showed towards me and didnt even tell me anything. For him, she is good and she is behaving like this due to my behaviour. And I am the problem. I even thought of breaking up, But I dont want to. I chose him..He is not perfect as am I. We both have flaws. And we are working on that. And have good improvements for past month. We are really having good time. My psychologist advised me to write about whatever negative feelings I have and burn the paper after that. And dont tell my boyfriend about my negative feelings, because he has depression and his own troubles. I am following that. I had asked a problematic question to him in the past :who is more attractive me or his bestfriend? And since he is honest, he answered me his bestfriend. I know she is more attractive. But I thought love can make people blind. I had few crushes before meeting him. After fell in love with him, when I saw my crushes pics in whatsapp status, I got surprised because I am not finding them attractive anymore. But for my boyfriend, he still says his bestfriend is attractive. He told me I am cute. And he likes my personality I know in this post I told about bad side of my personality. But Like all people I have a good side too, and He loves that. He told me he is lucky to get this much love from me, because from western woman, he wont be able to get this much love. Its both of our first relationship. But his answer that she is more attractive is still in my mind. For him, looks doesnt matter. He told me looks fade away, what matters is love and care and how we are behaving with each other. I am not showing any negative feelings to him or not annoying him anymore. But his bestfriend comes to my mind sometimes and its annoying me. I still feels negative about her. For note, whenever I used to have thoughts about her, I used to tell my boyfriend and he used to tell me Oh she texted me almost around the time I had thoughts of her. This happened a lot. So I dont know whether its a radar or just my overthinking. I feel like our relationship is only for one year by now. She has friendship with him for ten years. They only met once after highschool. Its only texts or calls now. That too my boyfriend doesnt reply to most. I feel like whatever I do for him, Still she is the one who was years long with him like that. I trust my boyfriend. But I dont trust her. After our marriage, I have to see her. I have to see her giving greeting hugs to him and being clingy with him infront of me... These kind of thoughts are making me worried.. My boyfriend cant say no to her hug, he already told me. He told me he wont take initiative to hug her. But if she comes to him, he will do. And its part of his culture. I am afraid whether I will cry infront of people when that happens. I am too sensitive.. Sometimes I even wish for their friendship to fade, but deep down I dont want that to happen. I only want them to keep some boundaries, which they wont ever agree to.. Any advices on what to do. Please dont tell to break up with him. I chose him. We have low compatibility now because of my emotional and mental struggles and I am doing therapy for it. I really want to marry him. This is the only problem in our relationship. I am not going to give up on us and I am working on it. I just want to be strong and not cry whenever she give him greeting hugs in future. And I still feels some negative vibes about her due to her change in behaviour and I want to get rid of that thoughts.",

Problems comes due to me not having been in the mood sexually lately due to a death in the family and as a result a change in her tone and overall just interactions with me. Due to my suspicions which Im not proud of and I know is childish I ended up checking her snap score on the alternate account and noticed that hers has been rising during periods where she claims she is doing something and hasnt been able to text me back and as I said we only use those accounts to sext so if me and her arent sexting theres no reason for it to be rising. Should also state she has told me before that since its not her main Snapchat that she doesnt have anyone else added on there and only uses it for when we snap on there so theres no other reason why it should be rising. I have somewhat struggled with insecurity and shes always reiterated to me that there is nothing to worry about and that shes not talking to anyone else but Im having a very hard time wrapping my head around this one and why this could be. Does where Im coming from even make sense or is this a massive reach? Im not going to straight up accuse her of anything when I bring it up instead just ask her calmly why this is and see where it goes but I just want to see if it even makes sense to.",

    "text": "I just got the worst text from my brothers ex. One no sister wants to hear . He has a coke habit. Apparently people are reaching out to his ex. And even tho shes in another relationship now, she took it upon herself to message me because we are friendly. She had warned me that Coke in their city is often cut with FETANYL and HORSE TRANQUILIZES. She said she recently had a close friend pass and has reached out because she doesnt want him to be next. My big brother unfortunately meets the criteria for functioning addiction. So convincing him he has a problem has not proved possible so far. Hes your typical emotionally repressed straight guy. Honestly I blame our mother. She was emotionally volatile growing up and I dont think it demonstrated effective conflict resolution or emotional expression for either of us. But that doesnt mean we cant improve . He already confesses to my parents and I that a few months ago he got robbed while blackout drunk. He was partying with strange women and when he woke up his money was gone. He responded to this by moving home with our parents and working remotely so he wouldnt have bills. This safety net allowed him to recoup and move back to his city where he says his friends are and where his tech job also is. We all mom, dad, myself live in the childhood home we grew up in our old neighborhood. Mom became less volatile with time and maturity. She is a good mom she just had her own trauma. But considering the alarming text I got from his ex and that he has been robbed I AM AT THE POINT WHERE I REALLY NEED MY BIG BROTHER TO GET SOME OF THE HELP HE DESERVES!! Please help me. I dont know what to do. Its hard because I dont think he takes me seriously since Im his goofy younger sister. But Ive had enough loss. I cant lose my big brother too. Whats the best way to handle this?!",

    "text": "I 22 m have been a traditionally masculine guy my whole life. Played all the sports, dated girls, etc. But, I have always kind of had this secret admiration for Drag Queens and their ability to transform and entertain. A few years ago, my girlfriend at the time wanted to mess around and do my makeup and I let her. I guess you could say that was the awakening? Since then, anytime I had some alone time, Id practice my makeup and even have a couple wigs and some padding to give me the curves for a more realistic look. Fast forward to a couple of days ago where my biggest fear came true. I thought I had the house to myself for a while, so I got in full glam to try out my first good wig. Only for my mom and dad to open the door and see me in my blonde wig and red body con dress with heels. I like to think Ive gotten pretty good at makeup and styling, and have a fishy drag look in general. They saw me from the side and my mom actually at first said oh, I didnt realize had a girl over! I didnt know whether to try and put on a fake voice or run lol. After getting a good look at me, they were able to tell that wasnt the case and i just broke out into tears in front of them. Not sure if they were tears of embarrassment or shame or what. I just dont know what to do now. We havent spoken on it much since and it just feels like theres thing hanging over all our heads. I understand how shocking it must of been to see their son dressed as a woman, especially because there really werent any signs. Part of me thinks its a good thing and I can explore this side of myself more openly. I dont know what to do. How do I handle all of this?",

    "text": "Assalamualaikum, Im a 21-year-old girl from Pakistan. I try to be strong, happy, and full of life but lately, I feel like Im slowly breaking inside. My home environment is extremely toxic. Theres no privacy, no peace. Constant criticism, shouting, being blamed for everything its becoming too much. Everyone says have sabr, just ignore, its normal, but no one understands how much it hurts to live in such an environment every single day. Im always told what to do, how Im not enough, and Im tired of being emotionally bullied. Marriage feels like the only escape. I know its not a perfect solution but sometimes I think, maybe a caring partner could give me the peace Im missing. But even then, I worry what if he turns out to be the same? I keep asking myself am I too sensitive? Is it my fault that I cant handle constant disrespect? I just want to feel happy and alive again. I want to smile without pretending. I want to feel safe, emotionally. Is anyone else going through this? How do you cope? Please dont just say ignore it I really need to know how people survive mentally in such situations. May Allah bring ease to all of us.",

We signed with a company in 12/2023, and everything was great in the beginning. They were responsive and seemed excited for the project. We were told project completion would be 10/24. It is currently 5/25 and it is not even close to completion. The companys communication is severely lacking and its impossible to get anyone on the phone, we leave voicemail after voicemail to no avail. Their staff turnover is so much that I never know who is the point of contact person as it constantly changes. We were promised a check in yesterday at 130pm, not surprised but no one followed up with again. We have already spent over 213,000 and are just beyond frustrated. Any advice as to what we can do?",

Hes for the most part a great boyfriend and sure we get in the occasional arguments, but nothing crazy. I love him very much. Last night at dinner I was like you know its weird you dont really talk to me about marriage and stuff and he was like well Im not sure if I want to marry you. I was completely blind sided. I thought he had loved me, which he says he does. And nothing he has done has really shown that side of him. I asked him to explain and he said its like this gut feeling - sometimes he does want to and other times hes like I dont know. And I asked wdym and he said we are different people and it seems like I dont like spending time with his family. Im absolutely heartbroken today the very least this came out of no where. Were having a talk about it later tonight. Any advice??? Anything you think I should say / ask specifically during the talk ?? Please help : I want to cry.",

    "title": "found out my bf is a cocsa perpetrator",
    "text": "a few days ago, i found out that my boyfriend of over a year was a perpetrator of cosca, my family has been through a situation in which cps had to be involved, and in turn my boyfriend had to have a police check done on him as he stays over at the house frequently, him, the police check was not cleared, he wouldnt tell me and the family why, he did tell me a little bit of the situation a couple of months ago. I myself have been through a situation where my older narcissistic brother physically, emotionally and mentally abused me. My bf told me that when he was he had been introduced to sexual behaviour with friends in school who he was close with, he was around 8 years old, they would explore each other, this continued for months until parents found out, it stopped for a while, but then came back up and they continued with it, eventually he would start replicating this with his sister at age 11, she was 9, a few years later she decided to take legal action against my bf, he says she fabricated a lot of the events, she said that she said didnt consent to anything he claims it was consensual as consensual as two children can even consent and that he threatened her with violence, which he says was untrue, he pleads guilty as he was told by legal aid that it would be an easier sentence, so he abides, he spends a few days in jail then his parents get him an actual lawyer, hes released a few days after, since then he hasnt been in contact with her, they dont have a relationship, their parents tried to get them to resolve everything, they havent, theyve both gone to therapy, they both do not want to talk to one another, my bf has a no-contact order against her, because of violent behaviour shes displayed towards him. Since then shes been seen as crazy, she screams at the parents, and him and his sister, and is going to other family members telling fabricated stories on whats happened, trying to get family to rally against him. Im feeling extremely conflicted on what to do, i believe that hes a changed person and that this situation occurred years and years ago, and they were both children, he hasnt displayed any signs of concerning behaviour, but at the same time I cant help but feel extremely empathetic towards her situation, because i know how painful, and psychologically and emotionally harmful it is to have a family member do that to you, i love my bf and i trust him, but what should i do?",

    "text": "Location: British Columbia Ive been with my husband for 13 years. During that time he has purchased 2 homes that we lived in. Im not on the mortgage or title, but I have always paid half the mortgage. I dont really have proof of this, or even that we were common law for so long. It wasnt until we got married that I signed an agreement that gives me half the equity we put in and gains on the home if we split. The agreement protects his moms downpayment, clarifies that my contributions are mortgage payments and how long weve been together. Unfortunately it only goes back to the second home but it is what it is. I signed it, but never received a signed copy back from him. I him asked repeatedly and my lawyer followed up, and their lawyer confirmed they would sign but I never got it. Im now preparing to leave, but Im afraid to ask him for the agreement because it might tip him off. I also dont want my lawyer to follow up again because Im worried it might be obvious its coming from me. Im. It sure if a lawyer would continue chasing a signed agreement after a year unless theyre being paid. Theres email evidence showing the agreement was made. Do I have any legal standing here without a fully signed copy?",

This past year there has been structural changes in the company and the opportunity to move in to other positions is limited. My dream would be full time in a position I enjoy at this company, however that dream may either not come true or take too long to wait for. I got a full time offer at another company and the job is so so. Should I leave my current company and accept this full time position, while looking for other positions elsewhere I enjoy? The only catch is I dont necessarily love the schedule of this new position. It will be full time which is great, and a change which is nice, but I will have to work weekends which Im not use to. Should I just accept this new position and keep looking elsewhere until something comes up, or should I stay in my current position at the Company I like and keep hoping for the best?",

    "text": "My ex 27M and I 26F moved in together in March and broke up two weeks later. I found a new place but am here for another month. Our relationship was no good but weve been talking and hanging out as friends to keep the peace. A couple days ago we got drinks together. I have never been a heavy drinker, Ill have a few drinks like every other month, I really dont do it often. Well I had way too much and ended up saying awful things like youre used and sleep around and worse, I hate you, I dont care if you wake up and understandably hes been giving me the cold shoulder. Details were very fuzzy for me. I did not remember saying such horrible things, I knew we got into an argument but I couldnt believe when he told me thats what I said. I am mortified and embarrassed and so regretful. For context, we were arguing that night because every woman that walked past hed say they were hot or checking him out and we should have a threesome with MY friend. He told me I was not the prettiest girl hes been with and referenced women hes now interested in and said theyre hotter than me. I guess it all built up, I was hurt and I was trying to make him feel as lousy as I do. With a clear mind I know that I have no ill will towards him. I want him to do well and succeed, away from me. We drive each other completely insane to the point we dont recognize ourselves or our behavior. A big part of why our relationship ended is I dont trust him. Since our breakup I have started therapy and have been doing well until this. I cannot believe the things I said to him. I have never said such hurtful things to anyone in my life. I dont know why my worst traits and feelings get brought out when Im with him. Its so out of character, Im disgusted and disappointed with myself. When I tried talking to him he said Im a piece of shit, I make him feel bad all the time and he does not like me or want to speak to me anymore. Of course I apologized profusely but he tells me my apologies mean nothing to himhes said this our entire relationship. I need advice on how to repair this or if I should just take it for what it is and accept that we shouldnt be friends anyways.",

    "text": "I think this may be long so bare with me. I have never felt this pain before and I dont know what to do. Didnt even know it was possible to be so upset you throw up and I dont know where else to turn. Im 21 and she is 20 and we have been together for over 2 years. Most of the time we were so fucking happy and I dont understand how it can all just blow up so quickly. I want to try couple counselling but everyone tells me that there isnt a point because at this point such a sudden change makes us too incompatible. My issue overall is that she is too over the top and controlling, and her issue with me is that I dont care what she has to say. Things like vaping, I vaped since before we were together and she hates it. Sometimes she would smell it in the toilet and be in a mood, okay fair enough but I feel like thats not something I should have to hide. I am not a hypocrite and I am very chill as a person, so if it was her who vaped then I would say to her that you shouldnt do it and try to help her quit, but every time she caught me she would just blow up. I had to start hiding it which made it so I would say I am quitting and I tried, but would slip back into it sometimes. That brings us to this week. I quit vaping for a few months and picked it up again 2 weeks ago as I was on holiday but didnt tell her. I also smoked a tiny bit of weed or whatever legal synthetic canaboid it was which I said I wouldnt do so I know that is a problem. I told her because she asked and I dont think its something that I shouldnt have to hide from her because I know that if she told me she did it I wouldnt blow up over it or anything I would probably just say to be careful and best not to do it, and if she still did I understand that is her choice and not something I can control. I am not a weed smoker, but its okay on very limited occasions where it is available to me I dont buy it. This week I took her on holiday just to a caravan in my country and we had an amazing time, apart from one time we were on a walk and I spent too much time looking at the graffiti on the walls with old dates because it interested me, and another time she found a vape I just bought with the intention of throwing it after like 10 puffs as they were only 1. I know this is dumb and unhealthy, I threw it straight away and shouldnt have hid it from her but I dont feel I should have to. If I didnt have to hide it and be so anxious and she helped me then I know it would be easier to quit. It all blew up when after this beautiful walk, we sat on the beach with wine and snacks after probably one of the best days we have ever had as a couple. She went to the toilet and came back and caught me with my no-nicotine vape which she new i had from the start of the holiday. She stormed off the beach so I just sat and watched the sunset myself, then came back to the caravan and she didnt say a word to me on the 2 hour drive home in the morning. When we got there, we spent 3 hours in the car talking and crying and then split up. We kissed and hugged and said we love each other so much We were supposed to do another lovely walk on the way home, but this didnt happen because she caught me vaping and I think this is just an overreaction, to go from having an amazing day and week to just blowing everything up because she saw me vaping a no nicotine vape, I could just never fathom doing this. I know that its not one thing, and it was a build up, but I feel that I treat her so so well and everyone i have spoken to agrees. My parents said I treat her so well and they have ripped into my brother before because they havent liked how he has treated his gf in the past. I know Im not perfect, but I think we are just too incompatible in this respect and she agrees. The reason Im so upset is because it has all just blow up so quickly. Everyone knew us as the couple who were so happy together. I know a lot of people wont like this either but its just how I feel, it makes a massive difference that she hadnt been with anyone else before me. I struggle with this because my ex girlfriends had been with other people and it made me depressed every time I thought of it, and now I know if I want to have another girlfriend she will have been with other people. I know its not the right way of thinking, but its just something I feel strongly about. I have never brought this up to her. Another thing to note is that for our whole relationship I have paid for absolutely everything. She has never had money and an issue in our relationship was that she never had a job, whereas I have had a job since 13 and now I have quite a good job where I will be earning a lot of money quite soon in the future, and I had to apply for jobs for her myself so that she would finally get one. She cant drive, and I said I would pay for all of the lessons as an investment into our relationship, but she turned this down as she didnt want to be in debt to me. My family has a lot more money than hers. We grew up in the same class and has the same things, but around covid the family business did really well and we moved to a nice area and have a lot more money. I say this because I was taught to value money and my future a lot as a child and it helped mold me into the person I am today, and I feel that never happened with her. She only got a job in April after I tried so hard to get her one and I feel we are just completely on different wave lengths regarding our future. She didnt try in her exams after I begged her too for her future and retook a year twice. I guess Im saying this to show that yes we are quite incompatible. I dont care about the money, its more that she is too over the top and controlling and I do things that she doesnt like that I feel arent enough to explode over. To be clear I know she isnt a gold digger or anything, I pay for everything but she never demands things. The one weird thing was for the first time ever when we arrived at the caravan we bought lots of things from the shop and i asked her to chip in a bit since she has a job now, so I paid 55 and she paid 25 then didnt speak to me on the journey from the shop. I guess this is more of a rant but I dont know what to do. I guess the advice i would like is whether anyone else has had similar incompatibility issues and what happened, did you get back together. I feel if we did then it would just end anyway and God forbid we were married or had kids by then. We planned our future together so much that now everything is uncertain, so I guess advice on how to navigate this would be good too. Many thanks, sorry for the long read",

    "title": "Terrified Ive cheated. Feeling like a disloyal/awful partner.",
    "text": "Rocd/ocd in a relationship. I posted this on r/relationships but it got removed. Terrified Ive cheated. Feeling like an awful person. I feel like a cheater and a disloyal person. I 19F have been with my boyfriend 19M for 3 years. My boyfriend is amazing and truly means the world to me. I also have rocd which means I have confession compulsions/instrusive thoughts so please bare that in mind. Im currently sat crying about this that happened 2 years ago. Please tell me if Im a cheater/disloyal person. 2 years ago, I was friends with this guy called ben Ben and I were friends, nothing more. I used to question my feelings for ben but I dismissed them as platonic. One day, I seriously started to question my feelings for ben. I imagined scenarios with us together and I did stupid things to get his attention such as: fixing my hair/posture. I guess I wanted his validation/attention. It was NEVER my intention to cheat on my boyfriend. One day me and Ben were on the bus home together and we started talking about attractive celebrities. My brain told me ask if he thinks your pretty to clarify his feelings for you. And again I wanted attention/validation. I said haha I mean do you think Im pretty? Ben got visibly uncomfortable and avoided the question. That same day, my friend sarah texted me and said she saw a spark between me and ben. I said aha what are you talking about. She said he sat next to you etc I said I mean he genuinely sat next to me because were friends. I then said well Im dating bfs name and Im not breaking up with him. One week, I went on holiday vaccation and my mom took a picture of me in a silly hat but I still looked pretty in this picture so I sent it to Ben and said me in York haha I guess I wanted a reaction. Ben replied looks great hope u enjoy it! I sent that screenshot to sarah and said see were just friends. Sarah then said well he wouldnt tell you to enjoy it if he didnt like you. Im not sure what I replied to that which is making me panick even more. I liked the idea of someone liking me but I never wanted to betray my boyfriend...ever. at some point, I realised what I was doing was wrong and I told sarah not to bring this whole me and Ben thing up again as it made me uncomfortable. Also, again Im probably overthinking this but ben was upset about something and I touched his arm to comfort him. I liked showing affection to him. A few months ago, I tried telling my boyfriend about this. I started off with 2 years ago, sarah used to ship me and ben. My boyfriend stopped me and said this was 2 years ago why are you telling me this now? And shut me down. Also, a few days ago my boyfriend faveourited a tiktok that said when your gf cheats but its okay because you werent giving her enough attention sarscam I keep getting thoughts such as: he would leave you if he knew your being dishonest by not telling him you dont deserve your boyfriend I honestly feel like I dont deserve my boyfriend and that Im an awful liar/cheater. Its so exhausting dealing with this. Advice needed. TLDR had a guy friend who I questioned my feelings for and seeked attention from. Feeling like a disloyal person.",

    "text": "Location: British Columbia Ive been with my husband for 13 years. During that time he has purchased 2 homes that we lived in. Im not on the mortgage or title, but I have always paid half the mortgage. I dont really have proof of this, or even that we were common law for so long. It wasnt until we got married 1 year ago that I signed an agreement that gives me half the equity we put in and gains on the home if we split. The agreement protects his moms downpayment, clarifies that my contributions are mortgage payments and how long weve been together. Unfortunately it only goes back to the second home but it is what it is. I signed it, but never received a signed copy back from him. I him asked repeatedly and my lawyer followed up, and their lawyer confirmed they would sign but I never got it. Im now preparing to leave, but Im afraid to ask him for the agreement because it might tip him off. I also dont want my lawyer to follow up again because Im worried it might be obvious its coming from me. Im not sure if a lawyer would continue chasing a signed agreement after a year unless theyre being paid. Theres email evidence showing the agreement was made. Do I have any legal standing here without a fully signed copy?",

    "text": "Location: Florida Im being charged with 2 counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, 3rd degree felony up to 5 years state prison. Im out on pre trial release and have hired a private attorney albeit not the best attorney, just one I could afford Every day i just want to get it over with already. I know Im going down the case is pretty strong so Id like to serve my time as soon as I can to put it behind me and get out sooner than later, instead of waiting 6months to a year or more for a resolution. I just want to ask my lawyer to request a plea deal for leniency in a reduced sentence. Is it even possible to do that right after arraignment? I doubt theyd reduce the charges to a misdemeanor offense due to the alleged circumstances of the case going off the arrest affidavit and sworn statements given I have arraignment May 30th where they will file formal charges and I have to plead not guilty as recommended by my attorney But the case seems open and shut. Theres 2 victims/witnesses that gave sworn statements to investigators and they both corroborated each other. I was arrested with a firearm. The prosecutor deemed the case as terrifying when arguing for no bond. I still got a bond because I have no priors or any brushes with the law I just want to fast forward to the point where I can present mitigating factors and have my attorney request a plea deal for leniency. I had a good job in a pharmacy before this. Ive never been in trouble. I have tons of remorse and regret. I have mental health issues I was taking medication for. Im not a bad guy its just a bad situation I have to deal with the consequences now",

    "text": "Everything started around July or August. I didnt know at the timeI thought they were just friends, so I didnt pay much attention to it. About five or six months later, in January, my sister F23 left for college on the other side of the country. In February, I F20 saw this guy M26 at the club. We were friends, so we were drinking and talking, and then his friends and my friends wanted to go to an after-party together. We went in different cars I went with him, but some of our friends ended up at a different party. One of my friends got too drunk, so we all ended up going to his M26s house. When we got there, we drank more. My friend blacked out, so we put her to sleep on his couch. His friends leftI was so drunk that I didnt even notice when they left. Then he and I M26 and F20 started kissing, and I dont even know how I accepted, but he carried me to his room, and we slept together. The next morning, we woke up confused. He took us home and got me a Plan B. We didnt talk for the entire month of March. I had liked him from the beginningfirst as a friend, because we connected really well. Around March 15, I texted my sister to tell her what had happened between him and me. I was so nervous because I thought she would be mad since he was older than me. But surprisingly, she said it was fine. She even said something like, You two can continue with your thing. Two weeks later, I saw him at the store, and we talked. I asked him why he had stopped talking to me, and he said it was because he thought my sister would be mad. I told him I had already talked to her. I guess we both misunderstood the situation, because we started seeing each other again. From April to June, we used to hang out every day, watching movies and having sex. In June, my sister came back home from college. One day, I was hanging out with some friends who only come to town during the summer. I mentioned that I was seeing this guy, and one of them said, I thought he was with your sister last summer. I was shocked and didnt believe it at firstit was so awkward. That day, when I got home, I asked my sister, and she said it was a lie. But I didnt believe her 100. The next day, I saw the guy and asked him about the rumor. He said yesit was true. He said, I thought you already knew. I thought she told you. It broke my heart. I was devastated because I was really into him. So right after that, I blocked him and started dating a new guy M24. Everything was so good and perfect with him, but it only lasted from June to August. In August, my sister left again for college, and I was heartbroken again. I decided to unblock him M26 for fun, and we started talking again and being like a booty call. We would see each other every night, Monday to Friday, to watch movies and have sex. That went on from September to February. During those months, I was also on Tinder, talking to other guys and going on dates, but he never knew. By February, I started getting tired of him. I had stopped seeing other guys in January and was expecting him to take me on dates. I thought he would do something nice for Valentines Day, but he didnt do anything. In March, I started talking to a guy M21 from the local college. I stopped seeing the older guy for a week, and then he texted me saying he wanted to talk. I told him, If you want to stop seeing me, its okay. We dont have to see each other again. I was so tired of himI didnt want him anymore. But he said, No, its not about that. I just want to see you. So I went to see him. We talked, and he asked me, Are you talking to someone else? I was so done with him at that point, and I told him, Yeah, I am. Why? Then he started crying, saying, Why? Why? We used to be together all the time, and I dont even talk to anyone because I only want you. I felt so sad for him, because for me, its always been him. So I explained to him how I was feelingthat I wanted to be more than just a booty call. He said he was going to change for good because he was sure of his feelings for me. And he did change. In June, he asked me to be his girlfriend. Weve been good since then. We fight very often, but we always reconcile. In those moments, I know he loves me, and I love him too. But recently, thoughts about my boyfriend and my sisters situation have come back to my mind, and it torments me. He already apologized. He said he wishes he could go back in time to change it, and I wish everything had been different too. My sister and I are goodwere good sisters and would never fight over a man. But I hate this feeling Its difficult if I leave or stay, and its my fault for feeling like this after all this time. Im more worried about what people would say or think about me, I feel like the most stupid person for loving him.",

Im very nervous right now, I dont know how much I need to pay for the damages but I think I can discuss something with them: 1. I didnt mean to damage it, during the process of removing the dumbbell pieces, they fell to the ground and bounced up and hit the glass causing it to break. 2. the dumbbell pieces were left on the bar by the person in front of me after use and I had to push hard to remove them, I dont think this is all my fault and the person in front of me needs to take responsibility for this too! 3. the dumbbell pieces and rods are very close to the glass wall and I dont think they retained 50cm off the ground I didnt take photos but I think they definitely didnt have 50cm Can these be used as grounds for me to request a reduction in the amount of compensation or to deny it? also, as this all happened under surveillance, I feel sure they will be able to find me I live in the flat above the gym as well as I would like to minimise the damages, do I need to reach out to them on Monday or wait for them to contact me If I need to make a complaint, which department should I write to in Sydney, Im new to Sydney and I dont really know whats going on over here.

    "text": "Hi. So, I started working at a grocery store for almost a year now, and Ive been having some issues. I applied for a position as a stocker, but then my boss found out that I have autism and switched me to the position as a bagger for this very reason, saying that I couldnt handle stocking even tho I did well at that role despite not being trained. I am currently a bagger and the job has worked out well, as it helped me tolerate loud noises, crowded environments, working under pressure, rude people, and socializing. Aside from bagging, I put back returned products and put carts back in the building. My coworkers were impressed by my work and suggested that I should be a cashier. I asked how do I become a cashier? and they told me to talk to the HR lady. So I spoke to her and she said I have nothing to do with hiring people. Go ask the store manager. I bet youll be a great cashier! So I asked her and she said yes! Ill get you started with cashier training shortly. Fast forward six months, and nothing happened. I decided not to pester anyone because I didnt wanna come off as bratty or a Karen so I tried to forget about it. Until one day, a coworker asked me why havent you been promoted to cashier yet? Youd be so good at it and I said I dont know, actually. I kindly brought the issue up to my boss and she said I tried to talk to the HR lady about this, and she said you cant handle cashiering. This shocked me. I have cashiered at a different place in the past and was fine. I am able to handle money as well as socialize I look people in the eye, smile, and say hi and thank you for shopping with us when I bag for them. And also, the HR lady told me she had nothing to do with hiring me, and she told me Id be a good cashier so she was just straight-up lying to my face. Oh, btw I also noticed she baby-talks to me in a sing-song voice and doesnt do that with anyone else. Idk if its conscious, but its just something I observed A guy who works at the customer service desk chimed in and said they usually dont promote people with special needs to cashiers because some of them have had meltdowns in the past and ran off, and the HR lady is worried and thinks youll probably do that too. I was baffled. Just because some autistic people couldnt handle the task of cashiering doesnt mean that EVERY autistic person cant. Thats stereotyping and painting with a broad brush. Its even more offensive that they keep people as baggers solely because theyre autistic even tho many of them are qualified to cashier So, idk what to do. This seems unfair, but does it legally count as discrimination? If so, what can I do? I dont wanna quit my job because it looks bad on paper and I dont wanna report anything cuz Im afraid of coming off as an entitled Karen Sorry if I came off as whiny, btw. I am grateful to be employed, I love interacting with customers, and Im proud of myself for overcoming some challenges with sensory problems and social awkwardness. I dont hate my boss and the HR lady either. Just confused about an issue and kinda clueless",

    "title": "My teacher gave me an F on a test where I had every answer correct, what do I do?",
    "text": "I got a chemistry test back on Friday that was about molar mass, and I received a grade of 5 equivalent to an F, even thoughaside from one follow-up mistakeI had everything correct. The test was worth 28 points. We were supposed to get 8 points for complete answers and 7 points for writing given and required geg. and ges. in German. Our teacher expected us to include the following in every problem: given, required, a clearly understandable solution path she deducted points from me because she claimed my steps were too hard to follow, even though I had explained everything, and a final answer sentence. We also had to include a main formula, proper units, and use formula symbols. I included given, required, the full solution process, and the answer sentence for every question. However, I didnt explicitly use a main formula because I had no idea what that was supposed to be. I simply solved everything through logical reasoning, since her explanations in class were extremely unclear and I had to figure out most of the material myself. I assumed that showing my solution steps would count as using a formula, since she never defined what exactly a main formula was. That turned out to be wrong, and she deducted one point for that in every task. She also deducted points because I didnt write down units during intermediate steps as I thought it wasnt necessary since you cant enter units into a calculator, and because I used full words instead of formula symbols, among other minor things. I already tried discussing the matter with my teacher, but she refused to acknowledge that its unfair to give me a failing grade on a test where the actual content was correct. Ive also spoken to my class teacher and the other chemistry teacher at school, but to be honest, I have little hope that it will change anything, as my school tends to be very strict about siding with teachers, with the attitude of you have to obey your teachers. Is what my teacher did even allowed? Could I theoretically escalate this to the school principal or the school board if the grade isnt changed? I honestly have no idea, but Im determined to get this grade changed because I didnt deserve a 5.",

    "title": "NYS - Served Eviction Papers - Full of False Info and more",
    "text": "Location: New York PM-Property Management I live in a housing development owned by a large corporation that was damaged by leftover remnants of Hurricane Debby, however the water damage and issues here are constant due to the fact it was built in a swamp. We sat in a moldy, inhabitable unit for 3 months until mold testing came back positive, then suddenly we had to move. Requests for the results of mold testing have been denied my son and I have health issues. It wasnt until October that PM did anything, and every time I inquired, they were waiting on insurance to see the unit. For context, my son receives SSI and is profoundly disabled. Yes, I know this is a defense. We also receive partial rental assistance which fluctuates due to my spouses seasonal position with a school district. Yes, Ive contacted local agencies for legal aid. Ive had a lawyer contact me however, like this subreddit, it is an advice relationship only, they have disclaimed they are not my lawyer. Things Ive already done: 1. Completed and notarized NYS UCS-LTN3 2. Taken out student loans to pay them--however, this is in a virtual bank account and I cant get a cashiers check. I asked them to turn back on my ability to pay via resident portal and that theyd get 3 payments due to daily withdrawal limits and this was refused. This money is still sitting in an account. 3. Reported housing discrimination to HUD. 4. Filed a complaint with HUDs Multi-family Housing Complaint Line. 5. Filed a complaint with NYS Environmental Protection due to mold issues. 6. Filed a complaint with NYS Division of Human Rights. 7. Reported the corporation that owns the housing development to NYS Consumer Fraud. 8. Registered with FEMA but this is its own set of problems. On the to-do list: 1. DRIE Application RP-459C. 2. HUD OIG report fraud on the part of PM. 3. NYS AGO Civil Rights Bureau 4. File rent reduction complaint with DHCR. 5. Call NYS Justice Center re: housing 6. File fair housing complaint with FEHO 7. Contact a mold-detection place. 8. Contact Performance Based Contact Admin to report issues with PM and building 9. Contact the Environmental Health Program for my county. Potentially important context: 1. Theyre trying to collect full rent for the 3 months we sat in a sewage-soaked, smelly, moldy unit. When I verbally asked about the provision in the lease about reduced rent for a damaged unit, I was told verbatim, We dont do that. 2. Our propane billing is on a two-month delay. 3. I asked them to correct errors in the ledger and they said it was correct probably so they didnt have to start the paperwork eviction process again. 4. Im not the only tenant affected by this, but I am the only one standing up to them. 5. Our HUD stuff hiccupped, this is not something I can control. Now to the other stuff! Ive edited it to take out anything identifiable. Notice of Eviction Petition: Page 1: it is claiming we owe 9,XXXX.XX but our resident portal says 10,XXXX.XX, but the 14 day demand that was taped to our door when no one was home has a different amount. The 14 day notice contains the amount for RENT ONLY and the other two higher amounts in the petition include utilities and late fees. Page 2: It is claiming we owe since November despite telling me anything paid to them is applied to our oldest outstanding balance. The utilities and fees line 3,XXXX.XX includes late fees as well. According to the online resident portal, they received an amount that was more than the rent from us and HUD in April, but havent applied the 400 money order. In November 2024 they received 996 didnt censor this as its a standard payout amount from HEAP and XXX from HUDadmittedly, they did not receive anything from us as we had to use what we would have used for rent to rent a U-Haul for several days. Page 6: I never received this via certified mail. Pages 13, 15 contain affidavits of service for 14 day notices that were taped to our door. The service attempts defined April 14 and April 15 there was no one home husband and I were at work, and we can prove this with timecards. April 16, they have to be lying about the time because it was taped to the door on April 14. On April 16, we would have been home at 6PM but there was no knock at the door and no one rang the doorbell. Please let me know if any other information is needed.",

He only told me because I kept asking him a lot of questions For some background, theres a significant age gap between us over 20 years, and hes not wealthy our relationship is pretty 50/50 financially .reason Im dating him is that he understands me deeply, and I feel very safe with him. The only real problem is this ex-girlfriend and his attachment to her, to the point where I constantly feel like a second-class citizen I also feel like I cant make a big deal out of things because our relationship is still quite new we havent even met in person yet its been an online relationship so far, but we are planning to meet soon",

    "text": "I F32 found a text on my husbands M32 phone telling another woman goodnight beautiful He does not even text me with that emoji so it took me aback as he is not someone who overly uses emojis period. I was getting ready for the day and remembered he had a haircut but couldnt remember what time his appointment was so I was going into his phone to see if he had an alarm set. I know his passcode and he knows mine but Ive never really looked at his messages like that. I dont know why but I opened the text app and saw the aforementioned text. I didnt have the heart to click into the full convo, but I saw whoever this woman was loved the message. My heart sank deep into my chest and I felt so sick to my stomach. Overcome with rage, confusion, and sadness o immediately woke him up and asked what the hell is this??? He quickly came up with a story that he was talking to her about her parents divorce and sharing about his upbringing with his parents to her, and he sense her spirits needed to be lifted so he sent that. I dont believe him. Not at all. My gut tells me theyve talked sent other things but I dont know. I asked after that story he told if I could see the rest of the convo and he said he promised hed keep it between him and her. I told him is that promise more important that our marriage vows and the trust we have cultivated. He said of course not. I said okay then let me see. We went back and forth and he even started getting very teary eyed. I think he knows he messed up. I said even if that is the truth its completely and utterly inappropriate for him to talk to another woman like that. He agreed and said he was dumb and hed never try to ruin our marriage. I just told him no one tries to do that. Indiscretions led us here. He left to get his haircut but I feel so sick and like I cant breathe. I dont know what to do. I feel utterly betrayed and like I dont know where to go from here. I never thought hed do something like this but there are clearly things he doesnt want me to see. How do I proceed? I dont know what to do its killing me.",

I was in a abusive relationship for two years, and he would constantly say that if i was not with him, no one would love me. I dont really know if thats a thing he made me think or i already thought that before, but now i find myself being a dependent person. Ill do anything to be liked, talk with anyone even though they treat me badly, and i know that happens, but i just cant stop. I can feel dehumanized, cry for hours for a man, and then when he text back ill be replying like nothing happened. Thats why i hate myself, its not physical, its psychological. I wanna be alone, and be comfortable with it, not feel the urge to get myself into something thats gonna destroy me. I looking for deep conversations and real help, thanks.",

Theyre thinking about not going bc theyre afraid of getting detained on the spot. I dont think thats a good idea, but is it fine if they dont go? They havent received a court date, deportation order etc. They did miss their parole as they were confused it was this check in, when it actually was a month after they entered the country. Even so, they havent received any card or anything. The son is going to community college and pays for it himself so I know thats something they should bring. This is all that was said on the paper.

    "text": "location: TN though i no longer live there and am a legal resident of another state as of June 2024 okay, so lets dive into this. i had a couple of abusive saverbal roommates, and we cut ties when i moved states for obvious reasons. i told the leasing office i wouldnt be resigning my lease but the roommates possibly would, i didnt know their plans, and i didnt really care. i thought that was all i needed to do, yanno, just letting the office know i wasnt going to be resigning shouldve been good, i figured. i moved states, its been great, im a lot happier being out of the south, etc. until last night, when im doing my application for my new apartment in a completely different state on the west fucking coast. and this apartment uses the saaaame website my tn one did for applications. lo and behold, that website claims im a current resident still in the tennessee apartment. i told them i wasnt resigning even if my roommates did. if im still on their lease, they absolutely had to of forged my signature and lied to those people that i changed my mind and wasnt moving. what are my options here? the leasing office isnt open until tuesday due to memorial day, though i did leave them a voicemail. is there anything i can do in the meantime? i do not want them fucking up MY name if they all get kicked out. and it has to be illegal to claim someone is on your lease if they arent even a resident of your same state, right? it has to be illegal in general, i would think! the dudes were assholes, but i didnt think theyd forge my fucking name on their lease renewal. i just want to be off their lease, not billed for that because i never consented to being on it, and i want them to stop trying to actively ruin my life. note: they have been trying to reach out to me but ive been blocking all the numbers they text from and i deleted all but one of my social media accounts out of fear of reopening a connection with these people. i dont want to have to communicate with them if i dont have to, i DO NOT feel safe doing that. please do not suggest asking them about it, i once more do not feel safe doing that at all. id like to solve this without having to open personal communication with them again.",

I love my girlfriend, she is a very caring a kind person but she very judgmental of when I try new things. I just feel so guilty from the fact that I have these thoughts of going out and doing things but have to convince myself that Im not thinking correctly and that if I did these things it would end up putting a strain on the relationship because it something she doesnt like. My question is that is it better to break something like this off or is it better to try and communicate that i feel held back and would like the space to try new things? She is a good person and great partner I just dont know if this feeling of guilt and ungratefulness. I love her but I just dont think either of us are growing together. Sorry for the rant",

    "text": "We liked each other a lot. We met at a community and instantly clicked. It was natural and so smooth. The moment it became too real, i said something to him and he said he was done with me. I was clingy and vulnerable. Things were in an on and off situation. We unfortunately used to see each others face and became normal friends. It was working fine. Eventually his soft side started showing up. He got a job, and sent me the picture of his desk and said that he wanted to send this for soo long. One fine day, I texted him excitedly but he dismissed it. Assuming that he had no interest in me, i wished to move on. But, a week later, he de routed to come to my place. We went out and ended up becoming extremely intimate. We started going out more. We used to just meet, and do the deed, but I wanted more. Realizing that I am putting in more than him, i backed off. I dont know psychology but this attracted him. He would hold my hand and we would try to be close in public without anyone seeing us. But idk the attention used to put him off, so next time we met, it looked as if nothing existed. Last time we met, he welcomed me on door of the cafe and kissed me. The whole time he was trying to control himself around me. We decided to meet 2 days later but then he cancelled. He said that he wants to end this. There is no future and I deserve way better. Either he is not sure of me or genuinely thinks I am better. I earn way more, have a more stable life, am prettier and smarter. I wanted to send a closure message but I didnt. I saw a video that said my daddy issues makes me fall for guys who are not interested my father was an abuser I got a text from him yesterday. Very generic - if I got a new equipment. I said yes. He asked which one? I havent read that text. Ill be seeing him tomorrow after his lets end this text. How to just face him and not let this get into my brain, heart of vagina again?",

    "text": "Beyond embarrassing to admit this, before I continue I will say this is more of a rant than anything but I have truly lost a lot of hope when it comes to socializing nowadays. Context, I just graduated high school and am 18 with now starting the summer which I dread. I dont have many friends which is alright, and my one best friend and I do really well but as an extrovert I seek more connections. Ive always been on the look out to meet new people and become friends, consciously or not. I have tried to do the most common things to expand my circle go out alone or with friends, talk to strangers, go on dating apps not a good idea, service work and volenteering plus keeping up with old acquaintances and reaching out to people. I enjoy the presence of people but I by no means hate being alone, I enjoy it a lot and a lot of my hobbies and outings I do on my own with much joy. However it doesnt change my yearning for people. I havent always been this way, friendships just like for most children came easy to me and I had many friend groups throughout the years but most were short lived. Even with that in mind those old friends and I have no ill feelings to eachother and can easily communicate or even hang out. My biggest problem is that I have many people I know and can reach out to, which I do, however this usually leads to no where because although I dont want to bitch and moan but I am not a big enough of a priority to go out of their way to see. People dont make it a great deal to invite me, but they dont not want me there either so I am just that one person that always tags along. I try to stay busy to avoid feeling this way, which helps most of the time and I do know that perhaps getting a job would be a solution however due to family circumstances I cannot. I am going to college after this summer, but Id like to enjoy my summer at least a little bit and not feel alone before then, plus nothing is 100 and I can only hope to make new and meaningful connections. As someone who has great amount of love for myself this has started to slowly chew at my self confidence because the common factor is me, I cannot blame everyone around me. I do have very close online friends and I am close with my family however the type of partnership I crave is of friendship or relationship in real life. Maybe it is just me but I wish making friends was easier, however thank you for reading this long rant, I appreciate it.",

I have to study most of the time, all the friends i had were in college so i have none here. I go to the gym and thats it. I dont really have any hobbies. Its very easy to feel burnt out but theres no way to refresh myself. My parents are supportive but I cant really talk to them about this stuff. Im in a long distance relationship and its going good but being far away sucks. So i have no one with me at the moment and i feel so lonely. I dont want to do drugs to feel normal or happy as i used to smoke weed and take opioids in college and I dont want to repeat my mistakes. What do i do? I really want to do good in these exams but how do i study without feeling depressed and burnt out all the time? Ive tried various study techniques but at the end i just end up feeling not good enough and dissatisfied with myself.",

    "text": "Hello for further context my MIL is a very toxic people pleaser who wants to take my child once a week and show her off to people or just hog her in general as much as she can. I was raised by a toxic woman and I know that she knows what she did and didnt care , but the fact that my Husbands mother purposely does things to piss me and my husband off in preference of our daughter really just blows my mind. My daughter wouldnt even be here if we hadnt decided to have a child. And currently her grandmother , my MIL is taking it way too far , she has also accused my husband of being a bad father and tried to micromanage what we do with our kid and where we take her. Shes offering to babysit for the smallest , most unnecessary reasons. Its making me and my husband dislike her. Shes always taken her sons side , but now all she does is favor our daughter and its gone way too far. Because of MIL Ive almost fought with my husband over not giving our baby to his mom every week. Because of MIL , Im now experiencing mental burnout so I have to stay home for a while and ignore everyones messages , because she wont stop asking for my daughter every week even if we didnt ask her to babysit. Does she KNOW shes doing this and she just isnt sorry? She pretends to not know when shes pissing people off. I cant even believe shed do this to us on purpose. We are both going through mental burnout because she wont stop offering to babysit OUR child.",

I chose to limit it to before the 1900s because technology has upended life in so many ways that its too obvious of an answer, imo.

    "title": "How to better my F24 relationship with M25?",
    "text": "Before you read, I do share some TMI and details so stop reading if youre uncomfy. My bf M25 and I F24 started a long-distance relationship 3 months after we started dating knowingly, and its been around a year and a half since. Im not a big fan of doing intimate things through the phoneits kind of awkward for mebut I still did it and tried, although when we did, hed do most of the talking. I also share some photos and so does he, although its been less lately. My mum got cancer a while ago and Ive been taking care of her 24/7, so I have no private time. Before I had to be with her all the time, we talked and I said I was worried about intimacy because wed go from some to basically none, since Id rarely be alone. He said it was okay and he understood. However, a week or so ago, he messaged me really late at night, like 30 minutes after we said goodnight, and told me he accidentally flirted/sexted with someone who was a friend. I knew about her but never cared much. He showed me almost everything, and every convo was very casual until, out of nowhere, that night she made a dirty comment and he went along with it for like a few messages I didnt really want to see those sexting/flirting because I was too hurt but from timestamp, it was like 3-4 messages. Then he stopped and messaged me. He said he zoned out because we havent really been intimate, and I understood. We talked a lot that night, making sure wed do better for each other, and I said Id try my best to be more intimate with himtry and send him more nasty messages, more photos, etc. But I also told him Id like him to talk to me more, and Id like us to spend a bit more time together, even just on Facetime or playing games, since weve always liked the same type of games. We agreed on doing better. However, not much has changed on his side and Ive been actually sad. I sent some pics of myself to him but got basically no compliments, just some pictures back of him smiling, when before hed comment about my body and make me feel pretty and good, even the smallest comment made me happy. I didnt think much of it because I wasnt fully naked, but I would never send those photos to someone who isnt my partner. I also tried to do some flirting, more dirty stuff, but it wasnt anything explicit, so I didnt mind his reaction, until recently I woke up pretty horny because I had a dream about him and I messaged him about it, with some dirty detail to try and get the convo a bit dirty, since one of his complains was how non dirty i was being lately, but all he did was reply with hahaha that was a nice dream and nothing much, and that left me speechless. Ive been trying so hard to break out of my comfort zone and do more for him, but Ive been feeling so discouraged because of how he replies to it. Im even now ashamed and afraid because I dont know the thing is, hes an amazing boyfriend overall. I know Im not the best girlfriend either. He helps me a lot when Im anxious, when Im feeling down and sad. He reads all my messages, listens to me patiently, always lets me finish talking. He has NEVER shouted at me, nor done anything bad physically. Hes an amazingly calm boyfriend. Just has been hurting me with these little things and I guess I need opinions from outside views or if you have any more questions? Idk, its my first time doing this TLDR: Long distance with my bf for 2.5 years, not great at phone intimacy but tried for him. My mum got cancer so Ive had no private time. He recently admitted to briefly sexting a friend because he misses intimacy. We talked and agreed to try harder, but he hasnt really changed and barely reacts when I try to be more flirty or intimate. Hes a great boyfriend otherwise, but this is making me sad and discouraged. Looking for outside opinions.",

    "title": "How to fix my 24F relationship even though he M26 cheated?",
    "text": "Before you read, I do share some TMI and details so stop reading if youre uncomfy. My bf M25 and I F24 started a long-distance relationship 3 months after we started dating knowingly, and its been around a year and a half since. Im not a big fan of doing intimate things through the phoneits kind of awkward for mebut I still did it and tried, although when we did, hed do most of the talking. I also share some photos and so does he, although its been less lately. My mum got cancer a while ago and Ive been taking care of her 24/7, so I have no private time. Before I had to be with her all the time, we talked and I said I was worried about intimacy because wed go from some to basically none, since Id rarely be alone. He said it was okay and he understood. However, a week or so ago, he messaged me really late at night, like 30 minutes after we said goodnight, and told me he accidentally flirted/sexted with someone who was a friend. I knew about her but never cared much. He showed me almost everything, and every convo was very casual until, out of nowhere, that night she made a dirty comment and he went along with it for like a few messages I didnt really want to see those sexting/flirting because I was too hurt but from timestamp, it was like 3-4 messages. Then he stopped and messaged me. He said he zoned out because we havent really been intimate, and I understood. We talked a lot that night, making sure wed do better for each other, and I said Id try my best to be more intimate with himtry and send him more nasty messages, more photos, etc. But I also told him Id like him to talk to me more, and Id like us to spend a bit more time together, even just on Facetime or playing games, since weve always liked the same type of games. We agreed on doing better. However, not much has changed on his side and Ive been actually sad. I sent some pics of myself to him but got basically no compliments, just some pictures back of him smiling, when before hed comment about my body and make me feel pretty and good, even the smallest comment made me happy. I didnt think much of it because I wasnt fully naked, but I would never send those photos to someone who isnt my partner. I also tried to do some flirting, more dirty stuff, but it wasnt anything explicit, so I didnt mind his reaction, until recently I woke up pretty horny because I had a dream about him and I messaged him about it, with some dirty detail to try and get the convo a bit dirty, since one of his complains was how non dirty i was being lately, but all he did was reply with hahaha that was a nice dream and nothing much, and that left me speechless. Ive been trying so hard to break out of my comfort zone and do more for him, but Ive been feeling so discouraged because of how he replies to it. Im even now ashamed and afraid because I dont know the thing is, hes an amazing boyfriend overall. I know Im not the best girlfriend either. He helps me a lot when Im anxious, when Im feeling down and sad. He reads all my messages, listens to me patiently, always lets me finish talking. He has NEVER shouted at me, nor done anything bad physically. Hes an amazingly calm boyfriend. Just has been hurting me with these little things and I guess I need opinions from outside views or if you have any more questions? Idk, its my first time doing this TLDR: Long distance with my bf for 2.5 years, not great at phone intimacy but tried for him. My mum got cancer so Ive had no private time. He recently admitted to briefly sexting a friend because he misses intimacy. We talked and agreed to try harder, but he hasnt really changed and barely reacts when I try to be more flirty or intimate. Hes a great boyfriend otherwise, but this is making me sad and discouraged. Looking for outside opinions.",

    "title": "Feeling somewhat unrequited with my 23F bf 24M of 5 years, how can I discuss this with him without sounding accusatory?",
    "text": "TLDR, I have been with this wonderful man since highschool and feel like I have to pry his feelings out of him but I am unsure if he is losing interest in me or if Im just anxious. I am not looking for how he feels, just wondering how a civil and productive conversation could go. Before you ask yes I am in therapy!! Yes I have spoken to my therapist about this !! Just looking for a fresh set of eyes I love my boyfriend so much that it hurts. I think about him the second I wake up and throughout the day I want to tell him every detail. What I eat, who I saw, every single thought I want to share with him. Maybe we are just different.. but sometimes it feels like I am bordering on obsession with him and it kind of embarrasses me. Sometimes we sit together and I tell him that I love him and he always says it back, but for some reason it feels like unnatural or kind of unfeeling when he says it. He only says it to me when I tell him that I love him. I feel that Im almost annoying when I say it, not that he reflects at all that hes annoyed, it just feels like he doesnt have the same unending desire for me than I do for him. It is possible we just have different love languages, his could be acts of service and mine is probably words of affirmation or gifts. I find myself having to hold back on telling him how grateful I am for him and how much I love being with him and seeing his face and touching his hair. Most of the time he just smiles and parrots what I say but he never tells me something specific about me that he enjoys or compliments me besides the way I look. I feel like Im searching for him to open up to me in some way, like unlocking a part of him. Its been so long and I know truly in my heart that he is the one for me, but I find myself doubting sometimes that he feels the same. I fear that if I ask him about it, he might be embarrassed and it would start a fight or make him feel inadequate in some way even though he is not. Additionally, if I say I need him to tell me he loves me more or give me more words of affirmation, I will feel like its forced or he doesnt really feel the things hes saying, just saying it because he knows I want him to. Sometimes I feel like hes going through the motions, where Im working to build this into a life together, maybe even a family. I like to tell him that one day I want to live together and have a family with him. I try not to bring it up too often cause the conversations are usually short and just filled with my day dreams. I want to hear what he wants just because he wants to tell me and share his dreams with me. Ill ask him where he wants to live in the future and he says he doesnt know and it feels oddly like we are still up in the air for him, even though I have never been more sure of anything in my life. I dont want to feel like this anymore. I dont want to feel guilty about imagining our life together all the time. Its been so. Long. If he doesnt know then I really hope that he would leave. I am definitely making assumptions and just working with the little I get out of him. In no way is he rude, or mean, or dismissive of my feelings. Again, he seems kind of locked up. We are still young, both working on ourselves and figuring career stuff out. I dont need him to KNOW exactly where he wants to be in another 5 years, but I just hope that its still with me. Its been 5 years and I hate feeling this uncertainty from him. I feel like Im missing something that he just needs to feel before he can be truly open.",

    "text": "Hi everyone, I urgently need advice or a referral to a tenant attorney in Los Angeles. I have until June 6th, 2025 to file my answer to an unlawful detainer that was filed prematurely and contains multiple factual and legal defects. If you know anyone who can help or want to message me, please do. Location: Los Angeles, CA Single-family home in Los Angeles, subject to Just Cause Ordinance. No lease. Work-for-housing agreement oral with the owner. Ive lived here with exclusive possession since September 2023 21 months. Ive never been served an AB 1482 exemption notice, either at the outset or any time during tenancy. Ive maintained the home, gas utility and internet are in my name, I have text records of the landlord acknowledging my tenancy. The landlord filed a 60-day notice to vacate on March 21, 2025, but filed the UD one day early on May 20 before the notice expired. At the restraining order hearing filed by me for retaliation after asserting tenant rights, the landlords attorney served me with an unstamped copy of the UDno case number, no court markings. The judge questioned the missing case number his attorney said he had just filed it, but I later confirmed with the court it had been filed two days earlier. The UD complaint falsely states we entered an oral rental agreement in January 2023I was living in an apartment at that time and hadnt spoken to the landlord since April 2022. Ive filed a DLSE wage claim for unpaid labor approx. 1,200 hours. My goal is to use that claim as additional leverage to negotiate a buyout. If anyone here can help or knows a tenant defense attorney who takes on solid cases like this, please comment or message me directly. Thank you so much.",

    "text": "We liked each other a lot. We met at a community and instantly clicked. It was natural and so smooth. The moment it became too real, i said something to him and he said he was done with me. I was clingy and vulnerable. Things were in an on and off situation. We unfortunately used to see each others face and became normal friends. It was working fine. Eventually his soft side started showing up. He got a job, and sent me the picture of his desk and said that he wanted to send this for soo long. One fine day, I texted him excitedly but he dismissed it. Assuming that he had no interest in me, i wished to move on. But, a week later, he de routed to come to my place. We went out and ended up becoming extremely intimate. We started going out more. We used to just meet, and do the deed, but I wanted more. Realizing that I am putting in more than him, i backed off. I dont know psychology but this attracted him. He would hold my hand and we would try to be close in public without anyone seeing us. But idk the attention used to put him off, so next time we met, it looked as if nothing existed. Last time we met, he welcomed me on door of the cafe and kissed me. The whole time he was trying to control himself around me. We decided to meet 2 days later but then he cancelled. He said that he wants to end this. There is no future and I deserve way better. Either he is not sure of me or genuinely thinks I am better. I earn way more, have a more stable life, am prettier and smarter. I wanted to send a closure message but I didnt. I saw a video that said my daddy issues makes me fall for guys who are not interested my father was an abuser I got a text from him yesterday. Very generic - if I got a new equipment. I said yes. He asked which one? I havent read that text. Ill be seeing him tomorrow after his lets end this text. How to just face him and not let this get into my brain, heart of vagina again?",

    "text": "I have just got over a bad depression episode which has lasted five years. Most of this time I have been really distant from my spouse not because I dont love her or find her attractive, just because I didnt love myself. Over the last five weeks I have been feeling more like me again after reading some books on CPTSD and starting to acknowledge what is happening in my head. Ive noticed a few things that has happened over the years that didnt click in my head at the time. For example her still talking to her ex partner on Snapchat which she hid from me the fact that it was her ex, to which she said it was just him saying sorry and it was so she can get closure. Ive also noticed that she has purchased lingerie to which Ive never seen before in my life, the time it was purchased she fell pregnant with out son this also worries me as Im questioning if he is my child, although I wont care if he wasnt mine biologically as I have been the person who has bought him up. She was also going to see her friend which apparently lives in the same town as her ex lives. Now today Ive asked her input on spray that she thinks I should get, as Im only trying to impress her. She said a spray which has only been out since Ive been with her, Ive never once worn this spray, although she said that it smelled nice. I dont know if because of my depression and CPTSD that Im trying to put a pattern there that isnt, or if my gut feeling is right. Every time I ask her about whether she has had a affair she gets defensive, when I said about even if our child aint mine it wont matter as Ive been the one raising him she snapped back and said it isnt if he is yours, you should be damb sure that you know hes yours. She has also told me to stop digging or it will be the end of our relationship, when I asked what she ment, she said that it will brake our trust and we need to be able to trust eachother. She has said for us to get eternity rings and had booked us a family holiday, as I said I wanted to be apart of the family and that Im sorry that I havent been there and in my own head for five years. Although I dont know if she is trying to do this to hide the fact that something has happened. I just needed other input into this as Im also scared that if I keep asking questions then I will destroy our relationship.",

    "title": "Do I have a racial discrimination lawsuit?",
    "text": "Location: North Carolina, USA Hi I dont post but yesterday I went through something so humiliating and I cried all day. I started working for a mid sized supply company a couple months ago and the company environment is so horrible. The older people are always power tripping and over critical of the younger women, the older workers bring in their whole families and call themselves legacies, its NC so theyre racist. Im the only Hispanic person in the office operations part of this company and I can count on my hands how many people of color work there and only 3 of us work in the office. The problem: since I started working there, I was told I dont have access to their direct deposit reimbursement stuff and was told I had to fill out an excel sheet and send it to an email and Ill get a check. The email address never replies to me or acknowledges me. I moved and I notified all the proper channels and its been a month since I submitted my mileage reimbursement request. I mentioned it to my manager after a 4 weeks since I dont really care about it but at the same time its still a considerable amount of money. She had me email her my concern so she can ask on my behalf since half the time I go ignored. Hr told her to go back to the email address that doesnt respond. They never replied until yesterday when the lady was just like your check was returned in the mail provide your correct address. I told her my correct address and mentioned that I notified all the proper channels 3/28/25. She never replied. I talked to the white guy on my team who was hired 3 months after me and has barely been there 2 months. Hes had access to this form since his first day. My manager called the 2nd in command in accounting and asked whats up with my check and the second in command asked why I get checks and said that only warehouse and cashier personnel get paid through check that the office gets paid by direct deposit. She checked my employee profile and said theres no reason for me to get checks. My manager said its just an inconsistency but also said that second in command set me up for direct deposit and itll be on my direct deposited check next week. I got paid this week. Im on the same pay schedule as the warehouse and cashier personnel when Im in the operations marketing and sales department. My manager also told me that an executives child was supposed to get my role before I was hired. The white people ignore me and dont acknowledge me and Ive been told by the few coworkers who talk to me that certain coworkers are just rednecks, professional way of saying theyre racist. I feel so humiliated. Ive organized their brand affiliated records and automated claim processes for them and started creating a records system for their marketing department and started their marketing product management expectations such as implementing job costing records, vendor relationships, and forcing old vendor to be more transparent since they had no control of their marketing budget. All for them to have me classified as warehouse/cashier personnel when I directly support the executives and their second in commands. My manager also was lightly laughing the entire time she was explaining the situation to me and said shed petition for me to be enrolled into the direct deposit stuff and texted me shell get the ball rolling for that in the next couple of weeks. Do I have a case? Or do I have to escalate this? I plan on submitting complaints to the bbb and our Secretary of State but this is so humiliating honestly",

    "text": "So I went to some nearby shops in my city and thought of buying some softdrinks. When I went to first shop, I saw a 40 bottle. The convo Me: Bhaiya iske kitne huey? Shopkeeper: 45 huey iske. Me : Bhaiya 5 wali disposal rehne do, sirf Coke ke batao. Shopkeeper: Bhai 45 hee hay iske. Me : Lekin bhaiya MRP to 40 ki de rakhi hay. Fir 45 kaise? Shopkeeper: 45 hee hay. I then kept the bottle back into the fridge and I was confused why would he do that coz just last week I purchased a coke from him with MRP 50 for 50 only! And now hes retailing like this. I then went to another shop and grabbed that same 40 Coke bottle. Now it goes like this Me : Bhaiya ye kitne ki hay? Shopkeeper: Bhai 45 ki hay. Me : Bhaiya MRP iski 40 hay to aap 45 kaise bata rahe ho? Shopkeeper: Bhaiya cold drinks pe nahi hota koi MRP tabhi 45 bol raha hu. He legit said that!!! What the hell is happening? I very well know its illegal to sell above MRP for Retailers. I wanna know your views and your scenario over this topic, how are you guys taking your step over it? And an year ago, I faced the same thing at a small restaurant nearby, when I asked for that 50 MRP coke to him he said 55, when I told him that the MRP is just 50, you wont believe what he said. He bluntly said koi bat nahi aap wapis rakh do fridge me. I was so pissed at that moment due to his behaviour that I never purchased anything from that shop till dated. Location: Jaisalmer",

    "text": "Hi, im using a throwaway account as I dont want to feel any consequences for what I say or for other people to. I dont really know how young but after my father disappeared which was around 5 years old, my older brother2 years older started to show me porn and eventually started making me reenact it with him. I was made to give oral sex and other things to him. This went on for a while, possibly a couple years, really until I started fighting back in general, against my bullies and him. I think him realising that i was able to defend myself was what stopped him from trying again. But despite it stopping, and me growing to an adult, 21, it has always bothered me. I have pushed the memories far far into my collection of trauma, hidden further from myself than the memories of my murderous father who used to nearly smother my siblings with pillows etc and tried to kill my mum. This is something i never wanted to remember, i never wanted to remember how my father was but even that ive been able to kind of accept. But the fact that i allowed myself to feel scared enough of my brother to let him do those things, haunted me and so i refused to accept it as reality. I didnt realise until now as an adult, that this has greatly impacted my sex life and i am an incredibly inappropriate individual sexually. I struggle to understand consent in moments of intimacy, pushing boundaries without meaning harm. This worries me greatly, to the extent that I am so scared of becoming an abuser i almost dont want to have a sexual relationship with anyone i may love. The phrase, hurt people hurt people plays in my mind often and i want to feel that i can be a normal person that would never hurt anyone like ive been hurt. Dark thoughts plague my mind these days, i think rape is vile and would and have committed great violence on those who have done it- though I for some reason i dont know, understand the urge. That disgusts me. My moral compass wont allow me to do such a thing but yet the intrusive thought has crossed my mind before. Im not really sure how to move on with my life, especially since this was so so long ago and nobody knows. I cant exactly confess now, it would only destroy my family. And for what cause? so that i can get it off my chest? Fuck no, thats not worth it, id rather deal with like i have been.",

    "text": "So weve been together for 5 years. At the start of our relationship, I was a very clingy teenager, we spent a LOT of time together, were basically inseparable. And then certain events led to us living together during the covid lockdown. We still live together. But, since then, our dynamic has changed a lot, I am significantly less clingy. I had a lot of emotional and abandonment problems I worked through and it made me a lot less anxiously attached. I really really really value my alone time now. Its super important to me. Recently, theres been a lot of tension between us. We had an argument last week, we were out with some friends, he wasnt feeling well and wanted to go home, I wanted to stay out because I was having fun and we hadnt been out in ages. He seemed a bit upset I didnt want to go home with him, and tbh I made the situation worse and got irritated at him being upset with me for wanting to stay out. It was making me feel like I had to go home with him, he tried to say like you dont have to come home I would just like it, but due to arguments that had happened in the past I just got really frustrated and blew it out of proportion in my head and felt like he was trying to guilt trip me. Since that argument theres been a lot of underlying tension but also a lot of fake niceness. I find in these moments I tend to fawn a bit, and its clear hes been trying to be nice to me. It was like we were both trying to ignore the argument and pretend we were okay? Usually he tends to avoid conversations about our relations and Im the one who tends to bring them up, but for the past couple months Ive become more avoidant due to idk, its just this huge emotional effort that I dont want to deal with anymore. I know thats unhealthy. Ive also just been feeling this need for more space but feel guilty for having that need. It feels cruel to not want to spend time with my boyfriend who desperately wants my attention. Like recently I got into playing this Sims, I know its going to be another one of my adhd hyperfixations, Im going to be obsessed with it for like 3 days, play it all the time, and then get bored and drop it for months/years/forever. I know it doesnt seem healthy to play a video game for hours on end, and I feel like only adhd people will get this, but divulging in a hyperfixation is really fun while it lasts, and although it causes some unhealthy obsessive behaviours like playing the sims for 6hours straight 3 days in a row it only lasts for like 3 days. My hyperfixations arent always video games, my last one was about saturation divers and I spent multiple days reading about them and watching documentaries. Whenever I have a hyperfixation, all I fucking want to do is divulge in it. Thing is, I also feel this obligation to spend like very evening with my boyfriend. So either, I wont divulge in it so much, will spend time with him instead and feel resentful towards him because Im forcing myself to spend time doing something with him that Im not super interested in, instead of spending my free time for the day doing what I want to do. Or I do take time away from him, but I feel guilty so also become very people please that day and constantly offer to go to the shops for him, or to make him something to eat or etc. its tiring. Also consequently, this week I did let myself divulge in my sims hyperfixation, and lo and behold today he is annoyed at me and feeling sad because we havent spent much time together recently. My god its 3 days lay off man. Idk this isnt really a new development Ive felt annoyance about this underlying obligation for awhile. And when he got mad at me for not spending time with him recently I just exploded. I got on at him for being needy, and how I feel like his only source of entertainment, and how its uncomfortable he keeps making sex jokes because clearly he has this unmet need and wants closeness we havent had sex in like a week if not longer which is unusual for us but the jokes make me uncomfortable and feel like poor taste considering they come after him irritating me by like tickling me or trying to stick his wet finger after Ive repeatedly asked him to stop and if he does actually stop I feel bad because it creates awkwardness cuz I just got mad at him but he was just like goofing around, and said to him you feel like a chore to me because ehe does. I dont spend time with him because I want to, I spent time with him because I feel like I have to. And he doesnt understand that if spending time together wasnt like a requirement everyday I would probably enjoy spending time with him much more. Its like eating ice cream everyday eventually it becomes sickening you need to space it out for its enjoyable yakno",

So-lm building a product, not as a techie but as a creative to help streamline the zine making progress and to make the zine community feel less silod. So l kindly ask answers to any of this: Whats the hardest part about making a zine for you right now? When you have a zine idea but dont act on it, what usually gets in the way? Do you have a process for organizing all your zine ideas? What does it look like? Have you ever started a zine project and then abandoned it? What happened? -Have you ever wished someone could just make the zine for you from your notes or ideas? What stopped you? Anything is greatly appreciated, and if youre willing to share more, ld love to give you something after this idea is more built out :",

I was in shock for a second and a coworker aid walked behind me and maybe saw the pic too. I deleted the pic and blocked the number right away. Then all of the sudden she said she had to get something from the faculty office, but the faculty office is right next to my Boss office. If she did see the pic and tell my boss could I be in any trouble? I did not show her my phone nor did I show anyone else, she didnt have my permission to look at my device either. I am freaking out but everyone around me tells me Im ok. In a legal standpoint do you think Im ok ? I also saw my boss before the day ended and she didnt say anything to me",

I have until June 6, 2025 to respond to an unlawful detainer that was filed one day before the 60-day notice expired and appears to violate several tenant protections. Location: Los Angeles, CA - I live in a single-family home subject to the Just Cause Ordinance. - No lease. Oral work-for-housing agreement since Sept 2023 21 months. - I was never served an AB 1482 exemption noticenot at move-in or after. - Landlord served me a 60-day notice to vacate dated March 21, 2025, then filed the UD on May 20, one day too early. - The UD complaint falsely claims we entered an agreement in Jan 2023, but I didnt even reconnect with the landlord until July 2023. - I was served with an unstamped copyno case numberright before a restraining order hearing I filed for retaliation. The judge questioned the missing case number. - I went to the courthouse the next day and got the full filing with case number. No proof of service has been filed yet. - Ive also filed a DLSE wage claim for 1,200 hours of unpaid labor. My goal is to leverage this and the unlawful UD to negotiate a buyout. I understand how to answer, but Im under-resourced and this has been deeply economically oppressive. My landlord is wealthy, and its clear hes trying to steamroll me, knowing I dont have legal knowledge or resources. If anyone can help, or knows someone who might, let me know. Thank you so much.",

    "title": "Islamic engagement, destroyed due to lies from potential sister in-law",
    "text": "I 23,F met this sweet genuine man 23,M 5 months ago. During this time we got to know one another fell in love. My relationship with his sister was pretty good. Once things started to get serious between us, he offered to fly me out to NYC so we could sit down for coffee talk a bit more before the nikkah Islamic marriage. Prior to me even arriving to NYC. I was firm on us having the nikkah and not engaging in anything haram prior to it. He responded I already have an appointment with the sheikh, itll be done the same day you land InshaAllah. I flew out to NYC met him in the airport, he reached out to shake my hand. I looked at him confused. We proceeded to walk to his car where he placed my luggage in his vehicle, then he drove to Brooklyn. Once we arrived to the hotel I looked around the room it was nice. He went to go sit down on the bed which confused me? I already stated previously on not staying alone with him or engaging in anything haram prior to marriage. His only response was Ill call the sheikh well have the nikkah I already made an appointment well have it today. I just stood there in shock wondering what his true intentions were with me went to go sit down on the couch while being in disbelief. Suddenly he walked over and stared at me while complementing my big gorgeous eyes I started to get up to walk away when suddenly he gave me a kiss on the lips. It made me so uncomfortable. I wanted to run out of the room right then and there it made me want to just suddenly disappear. He looked at my face and seen how much disbelief, and shock I was in. All he said afterwards was I have to go to work. He later called me hours later and said stay awake, we have an appointment with the sheikh for the nikkah I responded okay. About 3 hours later he called me saying I have to cancel our plans for tonight and tomorrow, my friend got into a car accident in Chicago Ill be flying out there to go see him. Hes currently on life support. I started to sense his friend being on life support wasnt true the whole situation wasnt true, and was just a way for him to not truly commit. The next day I texted his sister and said Im not sure what I did to him, there was definitely a sudden change it seems. I hope everything hes telling me is the truth, if I did anything wrong Id hope he could tell me. Sister: His best friend got into a car accident and hes on life support now so he and a few other boys flew to Chicago OP: InshaAllah, he recovers The next day, I started to pack my bags to head back to California. His sister texted me out of the blue asking if we had intimacy or kissed. At first, I told her no then she started to pressure me saying put your hand on the quarn swore by god my brother didnt kiss you. I told her We did kiss, but it wasnt consensual, it was unexpected. I never intended on kissing him prior to marriage. Please dont tell him that I told you, say Wallah you wont. Sister: Wallah I wont tell him anything. I proceeded to pack my bags, along with booking my ride straight to JFK. As I arrived and loaded my bags onto the cart, I noticed 4 missed calls from him. At first, I didnt think nothing of it just assumed he was upset about me not seeing him prior to leaving NYC. I checked in for my flight. Walked through security, and finally had the chance to call him prior to me bordering my flight. Brother: Did you tell my sister I kissed you? OP: Yes, I did but the only reason as to why I told her was due to being guilt tricked and pressured for me to tell her the truth. Brother: This right here.. its not good. My sister disclosed to me that you took a video of us kissing sent it to her. OP: That doesnt make any sense? How would it be possible for me to record if the kiss came randomly. Furthermore, I did not take a video of us kissing. Thats a lie. Brother: Okay, this is what she told me. We can talk later. Op: Okay, sure. During the whole entire plane ride I started to blame myself. I couldnt stop thinking how this situation wasnt my fault directly. There was nothing but guilt in me, I felt so disgusting and ashamed. Once I landed at LAX, and finally had internet connection I decided to text him. Only for me to discover that I was blocked. This left me feeling so confused heartbroken. I immediately texted his sister OP: I made it clear from the start about wanting things to be halal. said the sheikh would call, but it never happened. You cant put the entire blame on me.",

    "title": "My best friend 23M confessed Feelings to me 18F when I was 18.",
    "text": "Hi.. This story isnt going to be good. Im sorry. I feel ashamed of how willing Ive always been to accept and forgive abusive behavior. But looking back on the past, I cant change how I am or what tendencies I have to accept things that arent okay. I ask that you please try to be understanding of this I have been groomed in the past, many times. up from times where I was only nine years old, all the way up until I was 13, by older men in their twenties.. on top of that, I had lots of abusive friendships relationships in my life :/ and I have really bad issues letting people walk over me and mistreat me.. I seriously thought I was done with it, but whenever people put pity into the mix, or empathy.. They basically have no issues spinning me around their finger :/ I am admittedly a people pleaser, who gets attached easily and tries to think the best in everyone. this is all things I realize now.. It upsets me how long it has taken. being abused from a recent friend for a year, and now that friend.. she is telling everyone about this situation and contacting me about it too. I forgave my friend after it.. but should I have? Is what they did unforgivable and disgusting? :/ Ive always viewed my best friend as a really kind and sweet person. He is empathetic, he cares and always Now.. Respects my boundaries. They make gifts for me and take genuine interest in me and our friendship as a human. weve been friends two years by now. We play games and talk every single day. They listen to me rant and Yap about anything and we dont judge each other.. I always thought it was a nice thing to have a friendship like this which I always struggled to create before. At first, it was when we first met. Maybe 2 weeks after the fact, I was 17 at the time, we were playing a game. And they started the speech, many girls have heard a lot of times from their male friends.. they told me I dont want you to hate me, so Im going to tell you this. And they confessed they had feelings for me :/..at the time.. I was just lighthearted. I forgave them , I was just glad they werent the male friend who would ditch and leave me because they couldnt get a relationship. I saw how they said they felt as genuine and I said we can set boundaries and still continue to be friends. Since then, there was little to no issues.. Besides the fact they would often get very emotional and decide to leave me/block me without letting me speak or even communicating how they feel, it was very emotional and dramatic a lot of the time.. constantly going back and forth to try and understandshow they felt and how to fix it, oftentimes I couldnt and it was overwhelming. There were times that after I turned 18, they would push me into being a relationship with them. Saying that my boyfriend who was absent at the time due to being sick, and messaged infrequently wasnt treating me well, and basically if I didnt get with them, they implied theyd just kill themself because its like no one would like them otherwise. A lot of the time they threatened death and this stressed me out back into the cycle of constantly trying to help and never being able to. Otherwise.. Theyd also say it hurt them too much to see me with someone who wasnt there and that I wouldnt date him instead. So they would leave me and our friendship and Id be alone :/ It made me really upset. Im sorry this is so all over the place. I just need someone to ask. Im scared to tell our friends because theyll hate him and he told me not to tell anyone else. I made excuses for them all the time and I said Id forgive it only because it happened to me and not someone else. I know Im lacking self respect and care I cant change how I feel or that I care about them :/ apart from all this I feel like they were a great friend but people who told me about it are telling me theyre a pedophile and its unforgivable and Im being brainwashed/groomed :/ but I feel like I forgave them only because they didnt push my boundaries after that and we had a great friendship till these issues came up :/ did they do something horrible to me?? Did I just put up with it?? Ive been so set on just getting by, I didnt realize.. I cant process it..",

    "text": "My 31F bf 30M and I have been together for 1.5 years. Weve worked through some communication and intimacy issues, and overall were really compatible. Recently, I snooped through his phone after noticing he followed some NSFW accounts. I found his porn stash, which included porn videos, screenshots of Instagram models, and-most upsetting-pictures of women he knows in real life bikini or suggestive poses. That last part really hurt, especially since weve had issues with him not initiating sex and me feeling like I have to put in all the effort. I told him what I saw. He apologized and explained it stems from performance anxiety and low confidence in the bedroom and times when weve had sex and maybe it wasnt the best his confidence plummets not a lack of desire for me. He swore to stop and deleted everything. I feel like we should be working through it together instead hiding it and ignoring the issue. The porn part doesnt really bother me but I was afraid he had a porn addiction and that was the cause of our intimacy problems so thats why I looked through his phone. The pics of people he knows in real life is a very big problem for me!!!! I told him if were going to stay together, he needs to unfollow everyone inappropriate, that includes models and people he knows whos pics hes collected, let me check his phone, not hang out with girl friends, and be honest and open about his bedroom anxiety so we can work through it. He agreed to all of this. Idk how I feel, I feel like my sex drive is nonexistent now bc of what I discovered and I struggle with knowing hes had sexual thoughts about others and he wasnt honest with me. I feel a lot of confusion sometimes sadness and worry. I cant fix his lack of confidence for him, lve never judged him or complained about the sex lve only stated feeling upset for his lack of initiation. Im wondering what the path forward looks like if there is one?",

    "title": "My F26 heteroflexible ex boyfriend M32 I are working on things but I found out he planned to meet up with someone else.",
    "text": "Let me start by saying my boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. We have had hiccups in our relationship, but overall weve worked to establish boundaries in our relationship. We have both worked to figure out how to live happily together because we love each other. Some of the hiccups that I mentioned have involved his communication with previous sexual partners on his end whether or not those type of friendships worked for us/were honorable to our relationship. As most would think, I was definitely uncomfortable with hours of long phone calls with his previous hook ups. There was some friction between us because of this and we briefly split up over it. We ended up getting back on the same page and getting back together. We had another spat prob abt a year later broke up briefly again before getting back together. Both of these times, he reached out to his old hookups, or random girls he dated in the past. These breakups were prob abt a week long each. Another notable thing for me to mention is that throughout our relationship he has struggled with alcoholism. I think that him and alcohol just dont mix well. Whenever he drinks he becomes extremely reckless and emotional angry/sad or both. Overtime this is definitely caused to strain on our relationship. Ive brought up the emotional distress this causes me. He has mentioned wanting to stop or at least manage his drinking. Ive offered to go to AA meetings with him as support Ive offered to quit drinking myself, which I dont even do that often Ive offered to stop going places where alcohol is prominent to support him. Despite these things he has continued drinking. Although he drinks less frequently he still drinks in very high volumes when he does drink, which results in the same behavior. After a particularly bad night, I decided that this was no longer a safe situation for me to be in and sadly moved out and left the relationship. Approx 1 month ago. We have kept in touch. He has said that he wants to stop drinking have a happier existence work on our relationship. I am skeptical because he said this before. Heres the tea he is bisexual. It is something he discovered while we were dating. We liked to dabble in some unconventional shit for fun. We met a guy lets call him Rufus long story short brought him in for some fun with both of us. Contrary to what a lot of people say this never caused any issues between the 2 of us. We have always been great in terms of sexual intimacy, 0 problems. Which is prob why we keep getting back together. We are currently broken up right now however weve both expressed that we arent seeing other people or talking to other people and just wanna focus on figuring out if we can make our relationship work. I have some anxiety about this bcs he has entertained other girls previously when we were on small breaks. Last night I went over to stay the night at his place and somehow ended up helping him do something on his phone. He started to act weird at a certain point and even kind of shifted his phone out of my view. I told him that I felt like he didnt want me to see something on his phone. He proceeded to tell me that he knew I would feel that way, and sort of shamed me? I went to the bathroom and came back and sat back down on the bed and he tells me he has to tell me something. He said its not bad but he just feels guilty and wants to tell me. He proceeds to tell me that Rufus texted him today and he responded right before I went over. he was worried abt me seeing it. I asked him if they had been talking. He said that they have texted back-and-forth a little I asked to see the messages. The texting back-and-forth was actually them making plans to get together. Actually, the reason that the guy reached out is because they had agreed to hang out this weekend. My ex canceled plans and said he was bowed up couldnt meet. I am upset with the communication that theyve had and the plans to meet up. I honestly think that if he wouldve been honest and transparent with me about this, its not something that I wouldve been upset with. I can get behind him exploring his sexuality in that way. My hang up is I feel like he misled me to believe that he wasnt doing things like this when he actually was. Hes previously expressed that he feels I expect the worst from him. I told him that Id work to not do that because I care about how it makes him feel. I legit said this like 2 weeks ago. Also, after he told me he said that I shouldnt be upset about this, basically that its harmless. He said that they were just going to hang out but then later said something along the lines of I dont know if I couldve actually followed through with it. IT being having sex. TLDR My bi-curious ex of 3yrs I said we were not talking/hooking up w other people were just focusing on figuring out if we could make our relationship work, but he actually made plans to hang out with a guy we previously had a 3some with. Im upset, he says it isnt a big deal. I need hot takes on my shitty situation. Lay it on me.",

    "text": "For some background info, I am a female. I have been with my boyfriend for three years now. We share pretty different interests. He is interested in MMA, fishing, going to the gym. Im more interested in spirituality stuff. cats. animals in general. Going on walks. In the beginning, I was very interested in his interests because I had never really been around someone thats interested in his interests so I was very eager to learn about them and would ask a lot of questions. But as the years go by, I feel like we cant share our lives together because my interests dont interest him at all and his interests dont interest me much anymore, although whenever he talks about them , I still ask him questions and support his interests. Im just not personally interested in them. But also as the years go by, I feel like I want a partner thats interested in the same things as me and I dont know if he ever will be. Is there any way to make this work/anyone else in a relationship like this?",

    "text": "Im 25, female and the majority of my close friends are also girls. However, Ive met many guys throughout the years who Ive really liked and genuinely got on well with. But, at this stage of my life Im now convinced that its borderline impossible to have a solely platonic relationship with any of them. At sixth form I made friends with loads of boys in my year group, we would hang out together at weekends in mixed gender groups and several of the boys would come to me about problems with their own love lives and would openly discuss girls that they were into. I did the same with them about boys that I liked at the time. None of them ever explicitly crossed a boundary or voiced the desire to be more than friends, but a few years into our friendship, when I broke up with a guy that I was seeing at the time, most of my male friends started sending me text messages with sexual undertones and several suggested that I should meet up with them if I was after a rebound or wanted to make my ex jealous. At university, it was a similar story, I made friends with lots of guys, most of whom I really liked as people they were hilarious and always down for a laugh. I really enjoyed their company. Although when we hung out together in big groups no advances were made, if I ever met up with a male friend on his own, he would often get a bit too touchy for my liking and make things uncomfortable between us moving forward. I spoke up on a few occasions to different boys and asked what they were doing, being genuinely confused as to why theyd be willing to ruin a friendship when Id given no prior signs of being interested in something sexual. They all shrug it off and laugh then go back to normal for a few months before trying again the next time were all out drinking. I recently travelled to South East Asia solo-I went on my own because I was keen to meet new people and form friendships from across the world. Whilst it was easy to make new female friends who wanted nothing more than to just enjoy each others company, literally EVERY man I came across would push for something more. And that is no exaggeration, it was literally every single guy I met out there. It left me feeling really guarded because I couldnt trust anybodys intentions and I was miles away from home. Often a guy my age would ask me to join him for a drink on the beach, or spend the day with me visiting a temple, and Id agree-keen for a bit of company and eager to learn more about someone newbut every time without fail, after a couple of hours, they would make advances towards me and suggest that they stay the night at my hostel for a bit of fun Last week I met a mate for a drink who Ive known since I was about 4 hes a family friend and our parents are very close. There has never been anything REMOTELY sexual between us, hes like a brother almost. Ive met his girlfriends in the past and hes met my boyfriends. He was someone I felt super comfortable with but because we both now live in cities, I hadnt seen him for around 2 years. Anyway, last week we met up, got drunk together and he asked me if he could show me his new flat. I agreed and went to see how hed decorated it, but within minutes of entering, he had pulled me onto the bed for a bear hug and began rubbing his hands across my body. I laughed awkwardly and asked him what he was doing but he just responded by saying oh Im like this with all my friends which somehow I find hard to believe. I was almost hesitant to call him out because by acknowledging his behaviour, I knew that our friendship would never go back to how it had been before. Now Im left thinkingis it actually possible for a 25 year old guy my age to JUST want to be my friend? Maybe Ive had bad luck with the people in my life but it seems too much of a coincidence that this happens time and time and time again-wherever I am in the world. It also makes me feel pretty shitty that someone cant just enjoy my company or want to spend time with me without sex being on the agenda. Most of the men in my life dont outright express that they have feelings for me, or try things in a blatant way. Instead, its the subtle comments and inappropriate touches that let me know that if given the chance, they would sleep with me. Its really sad because I feel like Im missing out on so much. Although I love my female friends dearly, theres loads of men out there who are genuinely great company who Id love to hang out with as mates. It feels like just because Im a different gender, that will never be a real possibility. Men help, is this the norm?",

    "text": "I 20M she 19F have been together 18 months. Ok in June of 2024 I made a terrible mistake. some back ground to my story. My family and I moved to the US five years ago from a very religious and conservative Muslim country. My friend 19f moved from the same country 2 or 3 years before us . My parents enrolled me in a Muslim/ Arabic school that is run by the our local mosque. That where I met my friend I will call her Z . This school/ mosque has an after school youth program. It is separated, girls and boys. I was a senior and I was volunteering helping the younger boys. She was a high school junior and she was volunteering helping the girls class, so even though we were in different part of the school , but we met to coordinate activities. I fell in love the first time I looked at her, she was very shy and she would not give me a chance to talk to her or get closer. A little by little we started talking because we had to coordinate the elementary school graduation. We started hanging around after school and get some coffee or drive half an hour in my moms minivan to get some halal/ kosher food . All along I am so turned on by her looks , they way she talk , smile or even when she gets angry. I have tried few times to get closer and touch her, she will freak out and yell at me and read to me all this Muslim stuff that we shouldnt sin . This went on for 2 months . DAY OF GRADUATION We both worked really hard to make this event a success and it was . These little kids are a pain in the butt they dont follow instructions. After graduation we said lets get some food and celebrate the graduation. I dont want to go in detail we started kissing in the van and in few minutes after we are making out , she tried to push me away , but I was taking a no for answer. We ended up having sex in the back of my moms car. The whole thing didnt take more than 5 minutes. After that she pushed me away, she was crying historical and me in a shock and started thinking I am going to jail for ra even though she was a willing participant or my parents or hers will kill me . I am looking at her in shock and see blood on the car mate. I almost fainted. I was not sure what to do should run should I take her to the hospital. I just kept looking at her . Then she said take me home . I was relieved that a decision was made . So I am driving to her house and we are not talking . Then she she said, take me to Walmart. I need to clean up. At Walmart I stayed in the car she went inside for 20 minutes which felt like 20 hrs . she came back , she had a bag in her hand she gave it to me and said dispose this and take me home . I dropped her off and went home crying yelling at myself in the cars mirror. For the the next two days there were no contact . On the third day, she called me up and she said pick me up. We need to go to the Pharmacy I did. At the Pharmacy, she was looking for Plan B kit, which is BTW is giving free to girls . We read the instruction and we could tell, this had to take it in the morning after sex not three days later, but she decided to take it anyway. Then she mentioned she needs to get a pregnancy test. We looked at the box and it says that you need a minimum of two weeks to have the test accurate. This is only three days we bought it anyway.. In our drive back to her house, she looked at me and she said what are WE going to do? The moment I heard we I was so relieved. I said the only way is we have to get married let me talk to my parents and Ill keep her updated. You know as a Muslim girl she cannot approach her parents and asking them so to had to do that . THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHTMARE. When I got home, I have decided to speak to my mom. Shes much easier to approach than my father. So after a few meaningless nonsense conversation, I told her I want to get married, and I have the girl in mind. I really thought that she was going to faint, and despite me telling her not to tell dad, she went ahead and told him. Surprisingly, my dad was calm and did not throw a fit , he said, so do you want to get married? How are you planning on supporting this new wife of yours? You dont have a job you just got accepted in one of the exclusive seven years Medical program . How are youre planning on supporting your wife while you are a full-time student. I am thinking , he was right, l never worked a day in my life. All my life was I was only allowed to study and play some video games . After a few minutes, he got up and he said basically were done here. I dont want to hear anything about it and you go to bed now. . 13 DAYS AFTER THE NIGHTMARE. I was sitting in bed thinking about how did I ruin my future my career my dream school because of five minutes . The phone rang and it was her so I picked up quickly. She said we dont need the pregnancy test. I just got my period . You dont believe the weight got off my shoulder. That was the first good news I had for the last two weeks. . She asked again what are WE going to? She said as you aware i am suppose to be a virgin when I get married. I said give me some time. I will approach my parents again, even though I know there is no way in hell they will accept me giving up my dream and their dream seven years medical program because I need to get married. few weeks went by most of the time she calls me asking me if I have any news and I tell her Im still working on it comes august 2024 I had to move out of state attend the college and she went to her senior year in high school. After that, we were talking on and off basically shes asking me if I have any good news from my parents and I would tell her Im still working on it even though Im not discontinued till Christmas . Merry Christmas I went back home and I met her after three months and I was in shock . The pretty girl I remember is not here anymore. She looked tired sad and she let herself go. even though we were talking on FaceTime, but I was not able to see the whole profile of her. Again, I promised her that I am still working on my parents and I think Im going wear them down and theyre going to agree . that was a total lie . Now , we are in May 20 25 for the last five months. I start getting annoyed when she calls. I start screening her calls. I feel horrible about that but there is something inside me telling me bail out. Next month, the summer recession start ,I have to move back home , she is going to going to college at our hometown. She is studying computer engineering. I really need help I have a major mess. I do care about her, but I feel like my hand are tight. Please be respectful and dont judge me. I was 18 when this happened and she was 17. Thank you",

    "title": "I want to Go Back Home",
    "text": "I am 21, currently still in college, and live with my grandma. About a couple of months ago in December my grandma and her brother who owned the house along with her after an inheritance decided to sell the house, and my grandma wanted to move to a different state after selling. Upon hearing this decision I obviously felt as though my life was completely uprooted, as I am in the middle of college and graduating is very important to me, and transferring would be very difficult. Its important to note I rely on financial aid completely in order to go to school and do everything in my power to avoid going into debt. I made it very clear that I did not want to move, asking my grandmother multiple times if she absolutely had to sell the house and if she could just hold off a little longer until I graduated and could work full time to be able to live on my own. I had a very deep feeling that I nor her would even like it in the place she was deciding to move to and made that point very clear on multiple occasions. Ultimately, the decision was not up to me and my grandma sold. The whole sale was rushed, my grandma did not even buy a house yet before we were on our way to the new state, instead we, along with my uncle her son who also lived at the house and moved along with her, were staying at a family members house in said state for the time being. During this stay, my grandma would ask me opinions on houses I would tell her which ones I thought were nice and which were ugly but made it clear it was fully up to her as it was her money. Eventually, she decided on a house I thought was nice. Back to the college situation, I have a very good friend who offered to let me stay with her so that I could finish the next semester. We are very close and have been friends since we were 12, so it was not awkward or strange for me to live with her or for her to even offer. In January, I was headed back to my home state, and my grandma would be staying with our family member until the old owners moved out of the house she decided on. In this time frame, my grandma skipped out on the walk-through as well as inspection, as it would take longer to get the house. The plan was to finish up my spring semester and come back to the new house/new state in May and transfer to the school thats here. It is now May, and during the time at my friends house she told me she wanted me to come back and finish out the rest of my semesters at my original school instead of transferring, and I could visit my grandmother during winter and summer breaks. After I arrived at my grandmas house, she immediately complained about the house, saying she thought it was ugly, and it was almost never insulated, and as I predicted, she hates this town and the state. She then told me she plans on putting the house back up on the market within the coming years because she thinks if she puts it up too soon people will think something is wrong with it and not want to buy it. She then told me she plans on moving BACK to our home state after selling. I then brought up the idea of going back to our home state for each semester and staying with my friend to finish college at the school I originally started at. She then proceeds to blow up on me, saying she cant believe I did this to her, and that I picked out this house and I wanted this house. She told me I have no consideration for other peoples lives and that I am selfish and only think about myself. I apologize for the extremely long-winded and poorly written post. The whole situation is just very upsetting to me, and I just need to know what I should do in this situation should I go back to stay with my friend to finish up at my other school or should I stay here? Am I really selfish? Did I do something wrong here?",
