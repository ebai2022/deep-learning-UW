    "text": "I need some advice on how to deal with a family situation. A little bit of background info first. I am 23 and live at home with my parents and sister, whos 21. My parents just seem to let my sister do her own thing, whereas with me they are helicopter parents, especially my Mum. My sister works as a sales rep, so she travels sometimes 3 hours to customers. To cut down on travel times, she will stay with her boyfriend who stays about an hour away from us. My sister and I get on, but we dont message each other at all. The situation that Ive got is that 2 weeks ago she went away, apparently for work. This was nothing out of the normal and I didnt think anything of it. It got to Thursday of the first week and she hadnt come home, so I asked my Mum where she was, and she told me that shed booked some days off work to go away for the weekend with her boyfriend to a place around 4 hours away. Red flags started waving as I knew that my sister has used up all of her PTO for the year after 2 big holidays. I know that my Mum lies all the time to cover for my sister, so I was suspicious. I asked her each day just to see if she would change her story, and she went to oh shes at work to I dont know where she is to you are adults, I dont follow what you do. Skip forward a week, shes still not home and my Mums phone is unlocked on our kitchen table, she shouts me to take it through to her so she can make a call. I do, and as Im walking through a message pops up from my sister that her flight lands at 5, and can my Mum do her washing when we are at work so nobody will know shes been away. I have a look through the messages. I find out that my sister abroad with one of her friends, mum has told her not to post online, get tattoos, anything to make it obvious that she is away, shes made a cover story if me or my Dad asks questions transferred her holiday money the lot. My sister got home last night so I ask her where shes been nowhere special and she just says shes been away for a week working and staying at her boyfriends. I know that they are both lying as they are both terrible liars and Ive seen the messages for proof. I told my Mum that I know shes lying to me although I didnt tell her about the messages. She is just maintaining her story from before with thats all I know Its not the fact that she went on holiday, Im not worried about that at all. Its all the lies from, both of the,, and the fact that my Mum treats us so differently. I feel like she is happy to ruin our relationship, just so she can suck up to my sister. What do I do?",

    "text": "My 22M girlfriend 22F and I have been in a long distance relationship for about 5 years now. She flew out for my graduation but I dont tell her much about my school life since she didnt go to college and I dont want to stress her out with all my problems. At college, I made a friend 22F in my major who was a woman Ill call her Becca and over the past year or so have become relatively close friends but nothing really outside of the school setting. I didnt tell my girlfriend about Becca because she has a chronic anxiety disorder, and her worst fear in life is getting cheated on. I knew that this was a 100 platonic relationship with Becca and that it would always be that, so I thought that it would be best for me to just not tell my gf about her because I was worried about the stress it would put her through, being an extremely worried and anxious person. I didnt want her to be sitting in her bed every night worried that Im out doing something with someone I shouldnt be when I know that would never happen, so I thought what she doesnt know cant hurt her. Weve had a fantastic long distance relationship over the past five years, little to no fights, discrepancies, arguments. We text all the time, FaceTime every day, and overall had a great relationship. However, she recently went through my phone and saw the text conversation I had with Becca, which again was completely just friendly conversation, sports, TV shows, school, etc., and she got really really upset. I understand that I wronged her greatly by keeping this secret from her, and that I should have just told her about Becca from the start and dealt with the short term consequences. I was planning on telling her about Becca and some of my other friends slightly more than acquaintances, some of who were women before a dinner party with them all but I couldnt work up the nerve before she had seen the texts. Since this happened, shes been cold to me when were alone. When around others or while out shopping/doing something she still acts just as friendly and happy as usual, like nothing ever happened. When were just sitting in my room together hanging out or watching shows, she extremely distant, hesitant with touch or cuddling, and sometimes just flat out ignores me when I talk to her. Im not really sure what I can do to bring back the woman that she was before she saw the texts. Does anyone have any advice for what I could do or say to show her that it didnt mean anything and that I wrongfully was trying to shield her from something that I felt she didnt need to be worrying about? I understand I royally messed up in this situation and handled it horribly, but I dont know where to go from here. This woman is the love of my life, and I plan on proposing to her within the next couple of years. I should also mention that we currently are in the process of leasing our first apartment this upcoming August for my graduate school program, marking an end to our long distance.",

    "text": "All names listed here are not their real names. I F25 distanced myself from a former friend, Poppy F27 because of reasons I would rather not disclose here. I dont think Poppy realized that Ive been actively distancing myself from her. Another friend, James M25 and I were hanging out when he asked me why I havent been seen with Poppy in a while. I vented about my situation with Poppy. James had problems with Poppy long before the friend group found issue with her, so he listened and he seemed understanding of it. James then told me something Poppy had only told Larry M27 - that she was having relationship issues. I know Larry was one of Poppys closest friends, much closer than she was with me - so it did surprise me that Larry told James, knowing James didnt really get along with Poppy. Today, Poppy suddenly confronted me, accusing me of spreading rumors about her relationship. Not true, since I would only talk about my own personal experience with her but its true that it wasnt pleasant, which may have come across as talking shit. At this point, Im ready to lose my friendship with Poppy, but Im hesitant - scared, even - to tell her that Larry was the first source of information. I dont think we can continue being friends because inherent personality differences, but that doesnt mean I dont care about her well-being. I think it would break her heart if she knew that one of the people she trusted the most spilled her secrets to other people. Do I tell her? Or do I just take the blame and say I made it all up? This isnt a friendship I can see myself maintaining anyways. Am I being pretentious about this? I dont know. Any advice would be welcome.",

    "title": "Estranged brother is exhausting",
    "text": "Due to complex family dynamics my brother 34M and I 28F were raised in the seperate households in different cities, this combined with our age gap, weve never been close. For context: Our relationship became especially estranged when I was 15, and he and my sister 37F lived together, so I had visited for a weekend and he came home drunk and began verbally abusing me saying I would be a pregnant teen and end up just like our mum she had both my siblings as a teenager. After that we discussed what happened and seemed to bury the hatchet, and got a little closer but he moved overseas, COVID happened, he broke up with his then girlfriend and moved back to our home state in our home country in 2022. I had moved interstate while he was overseas to study and rarely travel to our home state anymore due to strained relationships with both parents and my older sister relocating to the same city not long after me we live together, so Ive only seen him once since his return to the country. During that time, it became clear he struggles with alcoholism. We spent 3 days together and he was drunk the whole time. Like, Id go to bed and hed say he was too, then Id wake to him being drunk in the morning because he actually stayed up drinking all night. Naturally, I was extremely concerned so we had a discussion about services he could utilise for support. This was in 2022. So between 2022 and 2024, he completely spiralled, didnt work on his alcoholism, started dating someone who encouraged it, they got on meth, abused each other idk the exact details but I expect they were equally toxic for each other, she filed a domestic order against him even though they were still living together? So he breached the conditions was arrested and in jail until the hearing. This was at the beginning of 2024. Post-jail, I attempted to be some kind of support as I am one of three family members that hadnt deemed him a lost cause. Im also a strong believer of being a product of your environment, and we had pretty rough upbringings so I cant help but empathise. But its become extremely exhausting. We still dont speak often, maybe once every 2-3 months and its usually when hes asking for money or wants to trauma dump. Onto what has happened now: this morning he called while I was at work, I sent a message letting him know and asked if everything was okay. So he attempted to call again. When I didnt answer because Im obviously at work he sent me a long message saying how things arent good because hes hit rock bottom, has realised he is responsible for his own happiness and has lied and cheated on everyone he knows and even though its too late hes sorry. The issue with his message? Ive heard it all before. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but Ive heard all of this before and hes still the same, if not worse. The main reason I havent gone NC is because we speak so infrequently, but the thing really getting to me with todays message is his blatant disregard for my inability to talk. While my employer doesnt stop staff from taking family calls, it was 9:30am and I expected a trauma dump, so no, I didnt want to take the call at work. But now, due to his disregard for my inability to talk and continuing to offload his issues onto me, Im seriously considering NC. Is it really worth it though considering how infrequently we actually speak? His behaviour is just so reminiscent of our father who also has a history of alcoholism and abuse, and that in itself makes our interactions already so exhausting. I dont know, I guess the idea of going NC because of the cumulative effect feels wrong? And like Im abandoning him. But the ongoing effects of our interactions just completely take it out of me because nothing ever changes. Note: Im not trying to shame anyone for struggling with substance dependency, I know and acknowledge getting support and help with it is extremely tough.",

    "title": "Is My 1 month boyfriends behavior normal?",
    "text": "I F19 have a 1 month fresh boyfriend M20 we meet through friends and started talking straight away. We meet up after 1 week note, I have never had a reletionship before we immedietly started making out and cuddling then went and talked for a bit, once it got dark he started asking more sexual questions we were sitting in the back seat of a car for hours talking and started touching me which I accepted. I thought it was a bit weird that for my first time meeting him outside of our friends we basically just kissed and touched most of the time? Is that normal? I just thought it was sexual tension or attraction? Its been a month and we have gone on more dates, mainly to look-outs we always end up in the backseat doing something. He dosent have alot of money so we cant go out on too many propper dates. We always end up using my car for drives because he dont have fuel, and Ive bought lots of things for him clothes, food, fuel money, paid for our date which I honestly dont mind. We have meet each others parents and he is really sweet and caring he says he sees a future with me, and we already say we love eachother. We make time to see eachother. All most daily at work and stays over once every week. I just think he has a high libdo and Im not use to it. FYI he has had a past relationship 2 years ago, she cheated on him and he has some trust issues. Understandable. So he is experienced and I am not. Idk just wanted to see what more experienced people thought about this. Im sure im just being dramatic. Thanks for any advice!",

    "title": "Conservative investing after Freedom Finance D-account support discontinuation",
    "text": "Hey there. I use Freedom Finance as an investment broker. Every month I deposit my account and then split the money between ETFs I use QQQM, VOO and SCHD and D-account deposit account with some sweet percents. Yesterday I found out that Freedom discontinues D-account support, so it just transferred that funds to my main account I use to buy ETFs. So now I have some free money and Im not really sure where should I put them in. Id like to keep the conservative approach with stable but maybe low income and low risk. For a rainy day, you know, same as it was before discontinuation. So my ideas at the moment are: 1. Buy extra VOO or SCHD I suppose QQQM is quite volatile. 2. Buy a single conservative ETF, like gold one. 3. Withdraw the money and use some classic bank deposit. Id love to read your thoughts. Thanks",

    "title": "Fell for my FWB, he broke my heart. Should I move on?",
    "text": "I met Mr. XYZ through Snapchat on 3rd August 2024. Our first meeting was supposed to be just for panipuri, but it turned into a casual cafe date. He made me laugh and seemed very cool and funny. On our second meeting, he asked me to go for a drive. During the drive, he started touching me and opened up about being into hookup and FWB culture. He told me he was in a relationship two years ago, but his ex-girlfriend ditched him. At one point, he parked the car, and I hugged him because I genuinely liked him. He took that hug as a green signal, and when I got back in the car, he tried to kiss me. I said no at first, but he kissed me anyway and I ended up liking it and kissed him back. During our third meeting, he asked me out for a movie. I was in my ovulation period, and honestly, he looked super sexy. We had sex that day my first time. After that, we started having sex about twice a week for two months. Once I thought I might be pregnant turned out to be a false alarm, and he even came with me to the hospital the reports were negative. From then on, we had sex 67 times a month till December. In JanFeb, he went on a tour, so we only met once or twice. He used to share a lot about his life business, family, friends and wanted to know about mine too. Whenever we met, hed take me to dinner or ask if I had eaten, especially when we met in the afternoon. I started falling for him. He knew my parents were looking for potential matches for my arranged marriage. He once told me that I should settle down its better for me. But also added that if I dont marry, its good for him because we could continue having sex. That comment stayed with me. Then in April, I asked him to go for a movie. He replied: Aap kaun? I replied sarcastically: Hum jo aapke saath mrwate hai And he responded: Doesnt ring a bell. That hurt me deeply. I said goodbye and havent spoken to him since. The thing is, I genuinely liked him. I know it started as a FWB thing, but I developed feelings. Should I just forget him and move on?",

    "title": "I accidentally revealed feelings to a colleague. She got closer, then turned cold. 25M/35F",
    "text": "Im a junior 25M, and she was a manager 35F in my department. At first, we just talked casually a few times in the office, in the elevator. It started when she offered to help me with work that wasnt even her responsibility. Before the New Year holiday, I accidentally sent her a message meant for my friend. It was about her. I wrote something like: Today I asked her if I could text her just to annoy her during her holiday. She laughed and said yes. She saw it. She immediately called me. She told me not to overthink it, not to worry. But then, two weeks after the holiday she didnt pull away. In fact, she became warmer. That was the turning point. The 5 weeks that followed: She asked her manager to move me to her project after I complained I didnt want to go on fieldwork. After that, we got assigned to the same project and we started getting close. Shed occasionally text me things like: Dont forget to save your file This email is funny She called me to her desk to talk about random, non-work things her lipstick, jewelry, snacks, friends. Some of the things that happened: She touched my shoulder softly while declining a chair I offered She sprayed her perfume on me after others teased me about my scent She once drew a line on my palm and said, You have no luck She let me hold the umbrella for her during lunch when no one else was around She called me after work often for an hour, 23 times a week while driving home. It started as work venting, then shifted to personal stuff weight loss, family, guys who hit on her she told me she wasnt interested She showed me her health check-up results and said, My BMI is too low you need to bring me snacks Out of nowhere, she showed me her old photo and said, I was your age in this one I once grabbed her blazer by the waist, saying You dont look fat, this is very loose and she replied, I bought it oversized Id poke her back or shake her shoulder she always laughed, never pulled away She teased me about my plush keychain: Its dirty. Wash it. I teased her about her gray hair and touched her hair she laughed and asked, Did you find any? When others teased us as a couple, shed say things like I dont like kids or Hes too young, Once I asked her jokingly why people kept teasing us. She replied, Maybe because were both good-looking just kidding Then my girlfriend found out. She checked my call history and contacted my colleague twice, behind my back asking her to stop talking to me. My colleague told her: Dont worry, Im not going to date him. I dont like younger guys, Im already talking to someone. We just gossip about work. But neither of them told me any of this. And my colleague didnt stop. Even after the second warning, she still: Engaged with me like before Sent me memes on weekends one about falling asleep in the office This suits you lol Messaged me on Valentines Day during an office event giving out cupcakes. She said: Still online? Go get cupcake. I replied, Want to take a photo together? She said: Will we get two? She also: Once said while walking to lunch: Go up the stairs first, my skirt is short let others see it instead Called me on my day off, asking if I was tired I had just worked overnight Invited me to sit next to her at lunch, saying the sunlight was reflecting off the floor at my spot Teased me about weight: Ill lose weight, and youll be left fat alone Kept calling me after work as before Then came the emotional bomb. After my girlfriend contacted her a third time, my colleague snapped. At 2AM, she sent over 50 messages in a group chat with me and my girlfriend. She listed everything between us, framing it as meaningless: I told him to bring his umbrella because mine is too small. We just gossip about work and colleagues. I gave advice on his masters degree I never planned to go with him. You wont even let him have friends at work? From now on, go have lunch alone. Stop asking me Im really annoyed. Did you talk to other girls but tell her it was me? It felt like she was trying to erase every emotionally charged moment by listing them all at once. I was shocked. I left the group chat without replying. But the next day at work, she still joked with me. She said not to worry she wasnt mad at me, just annoyed with my girlfriend. Then she disappeared. She was assigned to the field for 8 weeks. No contact. No messages. Nothing. I reached out once during that time: Come back and help me too much work. She replied within 2 minutes: Same here. Come help me first. When she came back she reopened everything. Two days after returning, I ran into her in the elevator. She initiated the conversation: Her: You have to help me push the car. Yesterday I really struggled. Me: You help me youre bigger than me. Her: Im losing weight right now. Me: How much? Her: None. Me: You drink sweet stuff every day how will you lose weight? Her: Yeah, and I snack late too. I walk to burn it, but it doesnt help. I felt like the old rhythm had returned. She later walked past my desk and looked at my plush keychain: Still dirty. Why dont you wash it? When my friend said, You look like you just woke up, she jumped in: Hes not even awake yet. For about two weeks, it was like before. Playful teasing. Warm tone. But still no outside contact. Then it changed again. One day, I ran into her at a minimart. She seemed colder than usual. Her: You dont need to wait for me. Me: Im waiting for my food. Her: Its really crowded here. Her suddenly: Is your girlfriend still crazy? Me: No. Why? Did she contact you again? Her: No, but you should apologize to me in front of her. That day you left the group chat without saying anything. I dont know what you said behind my back. Can you do that? Then she walked away. I was shocked. The day before, she was still teasing me. So that night, I apologized. Im truly sorry for how I handled things. We got close fast, and I didnt really know how to manage my feelings. When you talked to me like normal, I thought we were okay I didnt realize how much it had affected you. I never meant to hide anything. I left the group chat because I was afraid Id make it worse. If a public apology still matters, Ill do it but I wanted to speak to you first, because I honestly dont even know if youd want to hear from me again. Her reply was brutal: I never liked you that way. I told you from the start I dont like kids. I dont care who youre dating what does that have to do with me? You have terrible manners. I just didnt say it outright. You were too close to me. Its disgusting. Manage your feelings? What the f are you saying? I called you to talk about work, and your girlfriend goes crazy at me. Say sorry to me in front of her in the group chat. I was shocked, I just said Im really sorry I never that said you like me Since then: Ive seen her at work for two days. She avoids eye contact. Doesnt speak. Cold. Distant. Nothing left. Im not here to ask who was right or wrong I just want to understand what this connection really was. Was it just playful surface stuff from her side, or was there real emotional weight that she later panicked over? If anyones experienced something similar or sees this more clearly than I do, Id appreciate your take. TLDR: Accidentally exposed feelings to older colleague. She didnt pull away instead, we got emotionally close: teasing, touching, perfume, long calls, private jokes, even after my girlfriend warned her twice. After a 2AM outburst, she cut contact for 8 weeks but when she returned, she reopened everything. Teased me again, called back old jokes, acted like nothing happened. Then suddenly demanded a public apology in front of my girlfriend. I gave her a calm, honest apology. She lashed out and said I disgusted her. Now she avoids me completely. Did she ever actually like me or was I blind the whole time",

    "text": "We became married a year ago. I didnt know him very well, I was away for most of it, but he was nice. I liked him. And we seemed to get along well, and everything seemed okay. After we married I realised several things about him. The most important is that he is not religious. We were married because of religion, I am myself, and no one told me, because they didnt know. And perhaps I would be fine with that, but he is sometimes rude to me because I am. He finds ways to make arguments about how my religion isnt real, which dont even make sense. I believe in scientific things, I just dont believe they happened by chance. And if anything, we are supposed to educate ourselves and learn about the world, because thats important. He says I am ignorant, and stupid, but I dont think thats fair. He gets cross about so many things I do, the way I dress, he says I am boring. And then I get annoyed and he gets cross and its scary. I didnt marry for an exciting life. And he is mean to me because of it. And now I am pregnant. Which is fine, but Im not happy, because it makes us argue. He gets angry that I cry a lot, and that my hair has gone ugly, and my body too. But I dont think its my fault. It is the baby, not me. I dont hate babies but I dont think we will be good parents while we argue a lot. He doesnt want to raise the child in our religion and he gets angry when I ask, and I think we just do not get along very well. But I dont really know how to fix this.",
