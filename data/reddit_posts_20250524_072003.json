    "text": "Ill keep this post short since I probably wont leave this up anyway. I am just so crushed right now. We go to the same college. We text, we talk until 2AM, we study together sometimes even alone. He sits next to me whenever, even if his friends sit somewhere else. He justifies and explains to me if he didnt sit near me. He aske if he should get me something to eat or if my friends and I wanna come to with his friends to eat. He teases me about little stuff, he remembers which games I like or defends me in discussions even if he doesnt agree. In my presence he calls most other girls annoying even. But then, he says he has a crush on another girl but he doesnt know her name. And if our friends ask him about his crush near me he turns red and changes the topic. Or he says stuff like I got a new crush, I saw these girls while walking to class and they had style, I should learn language for my crush or Man, I dont even know her name. It is just confusing. First he is adamant with me he doesnt have a crush, then when I find out he says he doesnt know her name? Especially when even mutual friends asked me following, after getting to now my crushs crush: Is he my crush but they dont who it is from crushs major?. Made me feel hope but also it was weird since he is the only one I know in his major. It feels like he leads me on just to crush me again. I figured maybe a younger guy wouldnt be bad but hell, maybe he is still a child. I want to get over him but damn it is hard. I dont even know if he ever was or is interested. I just dont want to like him anymore.",

I was dropped off at an aunts or uncles house, I was the child who rarely had their parent there for a field trip or event. I assume that they thought buying me what I wanted would make up for that, but it didnt. I sought comfort in the wrong places, and now? Now I feel lost. I had a porn addiction growing up and it was going fairly well, as in, I had stopped consuming such contentuntil I dated someone who made it worse. And what makes it worse is that I think I am a hypersexual and it makes me beyond uncomfortable. I dont want to feel so dirty. I try to limit myself but then I keep going back and I know that it takes time, believe me I know it does. But how could I explain that to people around me? Especially since I started consuming media that is incredibly harmful. And to explain what I mean, my ex-girlfriend had a rape kink I never indulge in that, truly. When she had mentioned it, I was uncomfortable but I didnt judge and allowed her to do such but fuck. She messed me up, beyond. And I dont even know what to do. Im so scared for myself, I feel like I am rarely present, I dont try in school and I want to have some sort of a career, I want to go to college but I feel as though I will never because I am failing most of my classes. I had a plan to go to a good college, to be one of the first in my family to apply myself and fuck. I feel ruined. I dont even have many friends, and I cant converse with many people. I dont feel real. I feel trapped in a body that I dont even recognize but I hate looking at it. I want to hurt myself but Im too scared to. I think Im getting better but then I fail once more.",

    "title": "Commission Garnishments",
    "text": "Location: Florida Hi all, I work in sales for a medical-related company and have an employment agreement that includes a commission plan. Earlier this year, I closed a couple of large deals that were structured with rebates to the customer which was all approved. I was paid my commissions at the time calculated and approved by the company based on the existing commission structure. Now, several months later, the company says those rebates should have reduced my commissions and theyre demanding I repay a significant amount. I was never told the commissions were provisional or subject to change, and theres nothing I signed that said they could claw them back. I agreed to a commission structure change to take rebates into account, and I even offered a small, good-faith payment just to move on, but theyre now saying theyll garnish all future commissions until the full amount is paid back. HR also mentioned they could garnish wages down to minimum wage. I havent signed anything agreeing to this repayment, and my employment agreement is less than a year away and Im worried what they are going to do if I dont pay it all by the end of my term. Theyre refusing to show me where in the contract it says they can do this. Is this legal? Can a company retroactively take back commissions months after theyve been paid if theres no signed agreement authorizing it? And can they actually garnish wages like that without a court order? Appreciate any insight trying to handle this professionally but feeling cornered.",

    "title": "My gf f26 and I M28 have intimacy problems, is it fixable?",
    "text": "We have been together for 2.5 years and are currently living together. Our relationship has had its issues but for the most part we have good communication and are alligned on almost everything. The largest issue in our relationship stems from sex and overall physical intimacy. For some relevant background: she is very much a healthy weight, but struggles with her self esteem and has body image issues. She is currently working on this, but I am doubful any amount of weight loss with fully resolve this issue. Second, she has had some trauma from past relationships regarding sex but she has not outright said what happened. Finally she has mentioned she has felt disconnected from me due to our previously busy schedules, and we have weekly dates planned to try and spend more time together. She mentioned about 8 months into our relationship that her body image issues are affecting her libido. I was and still am very supportive of slowing down or putting a pause on sex to get to a point where she feels comforable again. However, it has basically not improved at all since then dispite several discussions. If I were to guess, we have had sex 15 times since she mentioned it. I dont want things to stay this way for ever, but I dont want to break up over something that could be fixable with patience and communication. The issues in particular are: She stated she will never be comforable initiating sex, and from my perspective, does not know how to properly escalate into sex when I initiate. She has said in the past there were times where she would have liked things to lead to sex but basically gives no hints or signs and I am left to guess. When I initiate she will sometimes go through with it, even when she is not in the mood for it because she feels bad not having sex with me. This makes me extremely uncomfortable as I can only tell part way through she is not into it due to her feigned interest. I have asked her not to do this multiple times and makes me feel very gross when it happens. I try to make things more enjoyable for her, but she is not comforable with oral giving or receiving and sex is overall just very bland. She does not like me focusing only on her or her pleasure in any way. Because of the body image issues, she does not often remove any of her top clothing, doesnt like me touching her for the most part, and generally only will do positions she is facing away from me. Whenever I am in the mood she will often tease me, make jokes instead of letting things lead to sex or say she is not in the mood. She will often touch me when she sees I am aroused but then do things specifically she knows will turn me off. For example: grab my nose or cheeks, talk about random things or make jokes that ruin the mood etc. To clarify, I would respect and prefer if she said she wasnt in the mood, but she does this instead and it is frustrating because I feel like she leads me on. At this point I know she does not not really enjoy sex but Im not sure how to improve it with the difficulties I have listed above. She mentioned she feels a lot of pressure to have sex because she knows I want to even though I rarely initiate these days once every couple weeks. So when I finally do, she feels like she has to because its been so long since we last had sex which ruins any chance of her enjoying it. Not being able to touch her in basically any way or show any sort of desire towards her or else she feels pressured leaves my hands tied. I am obviously not entitled to sex, and do my best to keep the pressure of her in other areas chores, bills etc. but its starting to really impact my self esteem. I dont want to leave an otherwise good relationship over something that could be fixed. Any advice on this would be appreciated.",

As the title states, officers served a search warrant at my house today - my husband was found communicating with someone online via an escort-type service who was offering him the opportunity to meet up with a minor. From what hes told me, he expressed to this person that he wasnt interested, but they persisted and supposedly plans were made for him to go to a hotel, which he did not do. I was given a range of dates in which this meetup was supposed to happen and he and I were together that entire weekend. This is a first time occurrence, he has never been in trouble with the law and he has expressed to me that he has never been in possession of any type of inappropriate digital content related to a minor. So my question is really what do I/we do from here? What is the likelihood that he will be arrested? How long does it take for a search warrant to lead to an arrest? Im so afraid and shocked and have no clue where to go from here.",

However, after filming I realized the type of content they made and revoked my consent as the videos on their page were more stages to look authentic such as saying couples reactions. They continued to post it even using me as an ad for their brand not stating so beforehand. They continued to ignore my requests to take down the video so I reached out to their family member and asked for help to convince them to take down the video. This got them mad and one of them did take down the videos. I got payed 150 and the other one is making me pay 260 for his losses to take down the video. Im unsure of where to take this now.",

    "text": "Throwaway account cross-posted. Ive 39f been with my boyfriend 38m for a little over 8 months and our relationship has been anything but perfect. He cheated. I forgave him because I learned I was pregnant not long before finding that out and it was a complicated situation. But it hasnt sat well with me at all since. Im now 20 weeks pregnant and just found out he has a newer dating profile connected with a FB account he blocked me on, but he hasnt actually reached out to anyone on it. It feels very shady to me. Outside of all this, we get along great and hes so excited about the baby - more excited than I am, truthfully. We started living together about a month ago and spend a lot of our time together. while its not perfect, he is making a true effort with me. I just feel like he may be living a double life and I dont know if I can trust him. Should I just end it? I havent confronted him about it yet because Im so torn on the situation.",

    "text": "Early on in our relationship my girlfriend volunteered that she ate a one night stands ass. She said she would try anything once so I made a joke like what about eating my ass? She then told me she had done it before implying she enjoyed it. I was shocked she told me this and I asked for a few details. She didnt make him shower beforehand but said she made sure he was clean visually inspecting his body. I told her I didnt want to know that she had done this before as I was originally just making a joke. She did apologize which I appreciated. Flash forward to where we are now. I have communicated to her on many occasions that I do enjoy when my balls and taint area a licked during oral sex. We try to do a good job communicating what we like. Unfortunately even when she asks what I want/ like she continually neglects to do this thing that I like and its starting to make me insecure. I dont understand how she can lick a strangers dirty hairy asshole, but not the freshly showered and shaved parts of my body when Im someone she says she loves. I did bring this up to her and her response was just that she would be better. Its been about a week and a half and not much has changed. It hurts extra since Im trying to communicate and its gotten me nowhere. Does anyone have any advice for me or experience with something similar?",

    "text": "So, im at the unfortunate point where im thinking of breaking it off w the the guy im dating. We r both in our 30s There are a few reasons, hes not a bad guy by any means but we kinda arent a match dispite geting along easily and having similar lifestyles. He has said a few things like why should the man have to win over the woman and hes not a big texter. I dont feel super pursued even though he has made time for me and we have gone on some fun dates. Its a bit on and off w him tho, periods of busy-ness then a really nice date. I do think he is actually busy and not lying about that, but im a stongnbeliver in if he wanted to he would. Hes not exactly inconsistent and i can tell he is putting in effort but its only when he isnt busy, once every 2 weeks sometimes. I have a little text written in my notes that explains this. It is not an ultimatum bc i am not trying to change him. He has been his normal self 100 and thats all anyone can ask for. I think a girl out there would love his dating style so im not trying to change him. I wish things were different bc hes a good guy but i will never beg a man for his time. If he was really into me and wanted me, i would know instead of questioning it some Friday nights. I think its best to cut things now 7 dates in before its too late. Im wonderigif a man cares to hear this shit or if i should just hit him w the so sorry but we arent a match. Good luck out there bc it doenst ultimately matter since we wont be dating anymore and the next girl will have different preferences than me anyway. TL:DR: Men do you want an explanation or just cut n dry during a breakup????",

    "text": "My boyfriendM 20 and IF 20 got into a small argument about being left on read. Weve been dating for two months now for a bit of insight. Sometimes I would leave him on read because he responds to my texts with a laugh in which those are the only cases I leave him on read. Unless he sends a picture of his dinner then Ill respond to the first pic and leave the second he sends after on read in order to not repeat myself but I always make sure to like the picture and let him enjoy his food at the time. So we got into an argument over text as we are in long distance and he said he gets upset that I dont start conversations with him which I try to but ultimately get left on delivered for hours. Once even for five hours in which I kept myself busy while waiting solely for his response. I brought it up to him saying its hard to make conversation when he leaves me on delivered for hours at a time in which I get hes busy but its still hard. Anyways, that was a day ago and today I tried to talk more and again left on delivered for an hour after each response. What really bothers me is he took my initial off his bio and Im not sure what to think about it. How can I confront him about this?",

    "title": "Should I skip a family holiday to Nigeria for paid work experience at EY?",
    "text": "Im 17, live in the UK, and I just got accepted into a competitive, paid work experience programme with the EY Foundation part of EY, one of the Big 4 firms in August. Its rare, selective, and something I could write about in personal statements for top universities not just a job, but actual experience in business and product management, which is the field I want to go into not nursing, which is what my parents want. The problem: my parents booked a 4-week family holiday to Nigeria without ever telling me the dates. Ive asked for months, and theyd either get offended or avoid answering. I finally found out were flying on 10 August, and I must be in the UK from 413 August to qualify for the programme. They wont allow me to join from Nigeria, even if I offer to use my own laptop and Wi-Fi. Now my parents are downplaying the whole thing. My mum says my ushering at church and job at a stadium are enough experience, and that because this pays 7.55/hr vs 9 at my job, its not worth it. But this isnt about money its about exposure, networking, and standing out to top universities and future employers. She even mocked the email I sent them and said she writes emails for a living, implying I wrote rubbish. She claimed the trip would only slightly overlap, but now admits it would cause me to miss the critical days. I also found out none of my siblings want to go this is more for them than for us. Last time we were in Nigeria, it was 6 weeks of boredom and isolation. I know if this opportunity had come to my dad, hed just change the flight or cancel the holiday for himself. But when I say the same, they act like Im ungrateful or too grown. Theyre not getting that this is about my future. This isnt like NCS or DofE this is EY. Its incredibly hard to even get unpaid work experience like this, never mind paid. If I skip it, someone else will take my place. If I dont go on this trip, theyll be furious. But if I go, I lose something that could shape my whole path. Ive asked friends some say wait, others say just dont go on the trip. Im planning to ask older people now too. But I only have a few days before they withdraw my place. What would you do? Have you been in a similar situation where your family didnt take your future seriously? Any advice on how to handle this without completely blowing up my relationship with them?",

    "title": "I dont want a divorce",
    "text": "My F23 husband M28 and I recently separated we got married after two months of dating the very beginning of relationship. I informed him I did not want to be with somebody that smoked. He informed me he could start quitting, but it would take some time after a year. I came to find out he had smoked several times behind my back and when I would ask him about it, he denied it and kept adding lies to it saying that it was somebody elses that he didnt know how the wrappers got there. My issue isnt that he smoked, but that he kept lying to my face after I knew and every time we talk about it he says Im mad that he smoked and why Im causing a big issue but I keep telling him its because he lied and it hurts because other people have covered for him and they act friendly to me and i tell him I feel like Im being disrespected And laughed at And in addition, I informed him I felt like I was being neglected and he was being distant. I work from 7:30 in the morning up until 10 oclock at night and he would get mad at me telling me he was tired and he could not clean when he would get home at four in the afternoon And so when the weekends would come, I would ask if I could spend some time with him or do anything with him and he would tell me its his weekend its his time off and so I would only be scrolling on TikTok and he look over at me a couple times Tell me he loves me and then ask me why Im ignoring him and I tell him Im not gonna be at your beck and call for whenever you want. I asked to spend time with you. Youre playing video games and you just look over at me for three minutes and think thats enough we have been living Separately for a month and we would talk for an hour a day. He told me that was enough time because he needed to do other stuff and when I bought it up to him, he would get mad and say that I was overreacting, and that was starting a fight. I would text him. I felt like he was being distant. I tried calling him. He would end the phone call after five minutes after three days of him constantly ignoring me I mention we should get a divorce and he told me I was overreacting. I told him that I had explained how I was feeling, and he was ignoring me. He told me why cant I just take a hint I asked why couldnt he communicate if he didnt wanna talk instead of just blatantly ignoring me he would say I would ignore him. I would tell him no thats not true because I would inform you if I could not talk or if I didnt wanna talk and you didnt care there were several instances where we had gone out something would piss him off and he start yelling at me. I once cried in the middle of a restaurant because he couldnt stop after. I told him to just stop and leave me alone. he believes that being physical with your significant other is normal I informed him that is not normal at all that it should never happen in the relationship and if it does, the relationship was over from the start there are times where Im laying in bed and I noticed that hes pissed off I tell him Im gonna go to bed and then he starts calling me names Im just laying there. Hes made me feel disgusted because most of the times when he would start something, I will not be wearing anything and I would feel so uncomfortable and disgusted with myself that a person that told me he loved me is telling me he hates me while Im completely naked and vulnerable I want to try to save this and I know I have said things that I regret, and I have informed him that I regret what Ive said and that I am sorry and when I asked him what he wanted, in my interpretation of what he wanted he to be done with us, but not say it because I would ask he told me thats not what I said recently he said he just wanted to be separated. I I asked for how long he said Im not sure maybe forever in my experience I know couple are separated, but they are no longer with their significant other and go off to be with other people while married and I said that to him and he said yes, but no, then I asked why cant we just say that were together and were just working on things he said no were separated -There is a lot more, but these are more defining moments that I am comfortable sharing for now and there is definitely two sides of every story from his perspective. He feels like I dont care about him at all. I know what most people would say based off of everything that Ive gone through because Ive seen it happen in my own parents so I know, but I am married to this man and I wanna work it out but hes not wanting to talk he would only call me at 11 at night when he knows Im gonna be asleep and then get mad at me and accuse me of cheating And I just dont know what to do. Ive offered to give him my phone plan detailed sheets Ive offered to download the Snapchat data. Ive offered to go to Apple to, recover all my messages. We have a marriage counseling appointment in June. Im not sure if hes canceled it. I just need advice on what to do.",

These people are camping on my socials and website, waiting for me to do or say something else. No exaggeration, they are psychotic, foaming at the mouth, trying to ruin my life. So last night at 10pm I posted a link on the front page of my website saying Important update on the situation: click here and the link led to a picture of a guy with a massive boner. Not trying to egg them on further, but sending a message that they are WEIRD for camping on my website! It only took 5 hours before they emailed my employer saying they might sue me for putting pornography on the internet without an age restriction warning in front of it. Just wanted to know if this is accurate, or if theyre bluffing. Because I want to put the boner guy back up if its not illegal.",

    "text": "Hi Reddit, I 20F need some help understanding how to fix what feels like a slowly crumbling relationship. My boyfriend 20M is the calmest, most emotionally intelligent and supportive person Ive ever known. Hes always been the one who grounds me when my emotions spiral or when I get overwhelmed. He never loses his temper he just handles everything with patience and love. But recently, we had a fight. In a moment of frustration and moodiness, I blurted out something I didnt mean at all I told him you dont care about me. It was completely unfair. I said it out of anger, not truth. I regretted it instantly. Since then, Ive apologized multiple times, sent him long texts, even made heartfelt videos explaining my feelings. He told me he needs space to process things. Its been a little over 48 hours. Hes still replying to my messages and answering my calls, but hes distant his tone is cold, short, and he just doesnt sound like himself. Hes never behaved like this before. Im trying to respect his space, but the silence and change in energy is tearing me apart. He says he needs time, but Im terrified that maybe something inside him shifted. I keep wondering has he started falling out of love with me? Is he trying to detach? I dont want to smother him, but I also dont know how to support him or how to heal myself while hes emotionally shut off. I truly love him, and I know I messed up. But I dont want to lose him because of one bad moment. How do I navigate this space hes asking for without making him feel pressured, while also taking care of myself emotionally? And how can I begin rebuilding the connection we had before I hurt him?",

    "text": "Im going to keep this short, because its much easier to share details with follow-up questions. Today I noticed my bf m23 has been actovely liking and following accounts in the area that post thirst traps. He engages with mostly this type of content, and I feel it hurts more because its people he could potentially link up with, you know, even though theyre not his friends I know all his female friends, and just friends and acquintances in general, and I asked him if he could respect our relationship by not engaging with this content a lot of times in our relationship, since if he didnt do it as a way to hand out compliments, he wouldnt lose anything, as theres no friendship or friend he is supporting. Im not insecure, I just feel like its unnecessary and disrespectful as weve had plenty of conversations about this. Hes also really into certain k!nks that these people post sub-porny content of, and I just find it distasteful, especially if hes told me hed respect my feelings Ive had longer conversations about this, and our compromises.. Funny thing is, Im not even allowed to post my feet in pictures or risque pictures fit checks that might be hot even if I am covered, while he likes posts like that and though I dont think theres something wrong with fit checks like that and its mostly about thirst traps and yk barely nsfw things/soft c0rn, that does say how he feels or sees these things..., and I respect that, given I understand his boundaries, but why hasnt he stopped after all these years? And is it stil worth pushing him to stop, if hes been doing it for a year last I asked him for the millionth time? I feel super didrespected and hurt. More about him lying to me than anything. I also just found out through suggested and how Insta pushes these things, hence finding out late. I had to beg him to stop liking his exs pics like this, and that he did after he found out she chwated on him during their relationship, but why cant he listen to me, and not fake having done so?",

A couple of days ago, we had an argument, and I ended up saying something really hurtful: you dont care about me. I didnt mean it, I was just upset and overwhelmed. I regretted it instantly. Ive apologized through long texts, videos, and everything I could think of. He said he needs space. He still replies to messages and answers calls, but it feels cold and distant. Hes never acted this way before, and its breaking my heart. Im trying to give him space, but Im scared hes falling out of love. I dont want to pressure him, but I also dont know how to start rebuilding what we had or how to handle the silence in the meantime. How do I give him the space he needs without making him feel like Ive stopped caring? How do I start reconnecting without overwhelming him? TLDR: Been with my boyfriend both 20 for 2 years. I said something hurtful during an argument you dont care about me, and now hes distant. He says he needs space, still replies to texts and calls but isnt his usual self. Im scared hes slipping away. How do I support him and rebuild the connection without overwhelming him?",

    "text": "For a little context, I have private social media where I dont really post much and only have like around 50 followers because I deleted most people that I think I didnt really need. I value my privacy more but I also deleted pics, my personal info on socials. So that being said, I dont get a lot of DMs anymore so if I like someone, I tend to reach out first. I dont have an issue reaching out first. I reached out to one guy like late December but it turned out that he was married and I didnt know because he also didnt have any pictures on his socials, and we instantly removed each other. awkward, I know Second time was like 2 months ago, I had constant eye contact with this guy at the gym and I found his socials and added him, but didnt message him. After a while, I guess he moved places and probably has a girlfriend now? I dont know. Third time was like 2 weeks ago, it was at this hotel that also had a shop inside and I went there 2 times and the guy that served me was handsome and the transactions that they give out had their names. So I added him on socials and messaged him, we did message the whole night and the upcoming day he said hey so I dont wanna give u any expectations because u seem like someone who wants to protect their peace and Im in a complicated period right now and I was like yeah okay, thats fine I hope you get better. Anyways, I was talking this out with my friend and she is the type that is very active on socials, complete opposite of me but she has this way of thinking that the guy should message first that its in their nature to do so. And she asked Yeah but why are you searching for a partner? Its not something that you need to search for, its something that comes to you. Yet, you add them, message them... To which I said, Yeah but how are they supposed to find me when my socials are anonymous? I didnt even have Instagram for like a month some time ago. And she said Well thats on you because youre ruining your own chances by not having socials, its a fact that these days most people communicate on Instagram. My friend has no rude intentions by the way, just to get that out of the way. I wanted to ask if I am overreacting over this because it got me thinking do I seem that way? Like desperate to go out with someone? I think that its fine for a girl to message a boy first, but is it actually not fine?",

    "text": "I know my best friend since primary school and Im 31 years old and she is 30 years old. She is a drug addict. The thing what pissed me off is I went to Corby to see my best friend and she brought so stupid guy she knows two months to ruin my trip by always bringing him along. I didnt get proper time to spend time with her as he was always there. She had sex in middle of the night and it disturb my sleep. I told her and him about it and they lied and said it didnt happen. I wanted to throw water at them on that night and tell them to not do it when Im there. He doesnt really help her get clean off drugs because they both go every week having drugs. He doesnt give her proper food as its a egg sandwich not a meal. They both have drugs every week. I dont think that he is helping her. Before she was like to me its not a good idea with her going with someone on drugs then she goes with someone on drugs. Tuesday I went out of the door as I was going to walk to the train station and she came out asking me why I didnt tell her that I was going. I hugged her then I walked then i stand somewhere far from the house crying my eyes out on how she has treated me. Eventually she text me saying that she will come to the train station with me. So she came out with that stupid guy. She said she is sorry for how she has treated me and she wants me to stay another night so I stayed another night. My best friend wanted me to stay on Thursday the day I went home by suggest to put my stuff upstairs I didnt do it. She kept asking me for money for drugs and she didnt buy any food. I emptied my bank account because she wanted drugs then when I got paid she went off with her house mate to go and get drugs not food. I had Mac Donalds then I told her that Im going when she finally appeared. She thought that I was in a mood with her. After that I hugged her and took the taxi to the train station and a train home on Thursday.",

Так вот, стоит ли мне пожертвовать своим комфортом в день свадьбы и использовать линзы, в которых мне не очень удобно или пойти в очках? Очки то мне идут, да и все привыкли видеть меня в них. Но образ стереотипно красивой невесты обычно очки для зрения в себя не включает.. я не знаю. Это может звучать глупо, но действительно запаривает меня такой вопрос.",

For context weve been married for 10 months together for 4 years For example, when I get my period my mood becomes a nightmare and I cry over everything its one to two days max - every month we argue about it and we have a big a fight Yesterday we went to a concert, I was hungry I didnt eat all day and Ive asked him the day before if we could eat there after the concert which he agreed to fast forward to the end of the concert we saw a food truck I asked him if we could grab something to eat he says he wants to get out of the place then he sees that I didnt like that and says go grab for yourself which I said no to because I didnt wanna eat alone so we spent the whole night arguing he kept saying my promises to you are nothing I can break them idk, cussing, childish, ruined my night, youre always upset at something idc... he said everything that Ive told him before it hurts me This whole fight was caused because I was moody about being hungry, when I get moody if you know me so well youll see it on my face thats it, I dont speak or say anything that would make him think Im moody except my face and he asks me to act that Im not moody so he doesnt see it He thinks any discussion is an argument even if were discussing characters on a tv show? Im so frustrated that every single fight I end up making it up for him even if I wasnt wrong just so we dont go days ghosting each other",

Im actually super proud of myself for how im dealing w this. I already knew that one doesnt have to read his book backwards or else hes get hurt. Knowing all this, and still accepting her apology? yea i did bcs im aware enough of how i gotta handle things now. I did add her back in my friend list and talk to her as well but this time, i dont share my problems with heras bsfs or friends do. Instead, i share how good my and peaceful my life feelseven if it doesnt. i keep our conversation very straightforward. No useless and shitty talks now. Basically i dont let her think about me or my problems. Ofc its never like how it used to be. That shii kinda hurts. but now im pretty sure, this patch up wont lead to a breakup again and none of us will get hurt again. So yea theres nothing wrong in giving friends second chances. All you have to do is to make sure how youre dealing with things now. Gotta deal with things in a way you wont get hurt again.",

Sa course naman kung nursing o something related sa law like legma. Alam kong medyo matagal pa, pero minsan kasi mabilis rin ang oras eh. Gusto ko mag nursing because I solely think na practical, especially kapag ibang bansa. Law naman dahil gusto ko talaga, matagal na. Ever since I was a kid, sinabi ko na sa lahat na law ang gusto ko. Lahat nga sila atty na ang tawag sakin eh. Pero alam kong mahirap. In 7th grade I suddenly realized how hard that path can be. Sa una ay dahil were not rich naman. Pangalawa, lowk thunders na dad ko kaya kahit anong gawin ko mas gusto ko mapabilis yung pag ginhawa niya. OA yarn Feel ko kasi mas mabilis ako makakapag trabaho agad if I pursue nursing, pero ayaw ko bitawan ang law school. Ayaw ko bitawan ang pangarap ko. Ayaw ko multuhin ng mga what if. Gusto ko na rin mapa-aral kapatid ko agad kaya gusto ko sana mag nursing. Feel ko rin naman baka sumaya ako sa nursing, pero mahal ko talaga ang law.

Theres this one guy probably around 42M who acts so awkward around me, almost like he tries to avoid me or doesnt say much on purpose. We had a normal introduction, but after that, Ive always got the vibe he felt a bit uncomfortable around me and I have no idea why. Ive seen him talk with other colleagues, pop into their offices etc. I feel like anytime Ive tried to talk to him he looks nervous/serious and flustered and dodges too much eye contact. He isnt married with kids because we were in a group in the lunchroom one day and I heard him tell someone he wasnt. I dont know, do you think he may find me attractive, but because its the professional workplace, he may be trying to avoid me as to not torture himself and completely eliminate the possibility of any type of feelings developing? Like had a little talk with himself nothing can happen here. Avoid avoid avoid! Im slim/fit, I dress well, most people would probably think Im attractive, but I myself am I a bit quiet and always keep things professional in these types of environments too. Ive been very polite and friendly towards him and nothing more. Its not a big deal, but it is something I noticed. Hes not awkward all around but he is with me.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, at the very beginning of our relationship he got me pregnant and made me have an abortion. I had to do it alone. I had to drive to a different state and have it in the clinic parking lot in my car alone. When I came to home after the abortion I found out that he has other children he isnt involved with and thats why he wanted nothing to do with our baby. Fast forward to two years later, we are still together and him and his oldest daughter have reconnected. Im happy for him but it hurts to see how much he wants everything to do with her and wanted nothing to do with me and our baby. And her mother has been talking about her coming to stay with us permanently. He makes very little money because he has to pay child support and I am the one who pays most of the bills. I know it sounds selfish but I do not want to be financially responsible for both him and this child that isnt mine and its because of everything he put me through. He keeps telling me stepparents are important too, but I dont know how to make him understand that thats not my baby, its not the same. Its not fair that he took that away from me and now expects me to bend over backwards for someone elses kid when I should have my own. Im trying my best to move on from it but how do I move forward from this? Is it worth moving forward from? I feel like Im trauma bonded to him and dont know what to do.",

    "text": "Ive been in multiple abusive relationships and I became really scared of sharing my needs and boundaries. Many people, even non-abusive, take it personally or feel attacked, or like theyre being called out on things. Even when sharing it as gently as I can, and telling them its something that has everything to do with me, even when I add stuff like they didnt do anything wrong but I just want to share how it feels and what actions Id prefer, even after all the therapy I had, practicing this for years, even after how much I read about healthy communication, how often I checked if I am in the right to ask for something, I still find this difficult because I cant change how people interpret it. I am talking about bare minimum things in relationships/dating mostly. For example calling me when they said they would, letting me know they are hours late, or holding me or giving me some space when I am overwhelmed or triggered instead of talking. Or for example, not planning multiple activities and then cancel them last minute - like a pattern, not one time but this person did it repeatedly. That time I asked them to please not keep saying yes to plans if they wont join me, that I would respect it if they said no, but that I wanted to know what Im up to. One time my need was for a man to not walk away right after sex and to be with me for a minute. Right now I am about to ask a man if he wants to be more transparent with me bc he didnt share he has non active herpes till after being intimate multiple times he didnt disclose before but I also didnt ask about his STDs. It feels like the world is talking all about consent, supporting women to have healthy boundaries, to share how we feel, but in my case - when I do, it is SO often leading to more frustration and hard conversations, that I am genuinely really fucking confused at the moment. I begin starting to feel like an object that apparently doesnt deserve respect the way I hoped it would look like. Its like I am being yelled at to say no, and when I say no, I am almost always getting into the web of either deflection, blame shifting, them feeling attacked so all energy goes to them feeling assured and respected again. Even if its not typically toxic or manipulative people. I am really starting to feel lost around this subject. I even thought of taking a step back from relationships and friendships in general because it became something triggering to me, to a point I just feel like isolating myself, but now I am at home drowning in my own confusion and doubts.",

    "title": "Auto shop in Palmyra, PA lied about installing a new alternator turned out remanufactured, now having issues. What can I do?",
    "text": "Hi everyone Im looking for advice and also want to warn others. I drive a 2001 Toyota Camry, and recently I had issues with my car stalling and lights dimming. I went to a local auto repair shop in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, and they told me I needed a new alternator. They quoted me 500, and when I asked if the alternator was truly brand new, they said yes. I negotiated and paid 250, thinking I was still getting a new alternator. After a few days, I started having issues: The headlights flicker when I accelerate, The dashboard lights pulse, It seems like voltage isnt stable a common problem with faulty or remanufactured alternators. When I returned to the shop to complain, they said: If you buy and bring us a new alternator yourself, well refund you. That was already suspicious, but later I confirmed they had installed a remanufactured unit, even though they told me it was new. Then they told me not to come back, and completely refused further service or refund. What Ive checked: Battery is good Grounds are clean and tight Headlight relay is fine The only thing left is the alternator and when I lightly rev the engine, the lights flicker, which means the voltage regulation is unstable. What should I do now? Can I file a complaint with the Attorney General of Pennsylvania? Should I go to the BBB? Or file in Small Claims Court? This feels like a scam they lied, installed a cheaper part, then tried to push the blame back on me. I dont want anyone else to go through this. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

    "text": "hey all - going to try list all context without making this an essay: im 22m, grown up in a tough financial situation so always been motivated to do well w money, live in government housing w my family, as the oldest son its always been seen by my family, extended family etc that itll be my responsibility to do what my father couldnt which is buy my family a house, take care of my mother and siblings well, for bit of background: my father has always been very bad w money management and didnt do very well financially speaking in life, also had a gambling problem and is compared to all my uncles who are quite well off and my mum just wants to enjoy life a little like my aunts can and have her own house etc everyones first time living so i dont blame her, culturally women dont work in the family and its the mans job to provide if anyones wondering why she doesnt work, also shes in no state to work due to back/knee/heart problems, i currently earn 65k gbp base and around 20-30k bonus, have around 120k gbp amongst savings acct, stocks shares ISA, pension accts, premium bonds - my dad works and just about runs the house, i help out at 650 a month atm essentially my rent for living in the house now for where im split and really need some advice because its been eating me up on the inside for ages and i have no one to talk to about it: i think within the next year, i can put a deposit down on a house around where i live, around a 700k house, and hopefully my income bumps enough to qualify for a mortgage but this will likely mean every penny to my name goes down on the deposit and without a doubt, id be covering the entire mortgage, around 2-2.2k gbp a month and as much as id love to see that smile on my families faces and id feel so successful doing that, itd heavily limit what i could do myself, i want to go out explore the world see things do things, maybe go travelling for a bit, build some dad lore etc but suddenly id have the responsibility of 2k a month to pay so i cant leave my job, my disposable income significantly tanks and living out would no longer be an option, holidays would likely be limited as id still want to save and worse of all is, id go from doing alright, as a 22 y/o w a decent bit of money to having nothing and starting from 0 which delays everything for myself and my own family down the line and i just cannot for the life of me understand whats right, its everyones first time living and i just dont know if i want to buy a house and lock myself in, i just enjoy the lack of responsibility i have right now and want to keep it that way, and like the ability to potentially go travelling any time is such a privilege to me but thatd genuinely not be an option anymore and i hate the idea of that my biggest fear is regret in 10 years from now i just sit and think abt this a lot, im struggling to concentrate on things and its kinda internally driving my crazy as i have no one to talk to about it and ask for guidance like even at work someone will be talking to me and i just drift away cuz im internally so stressed i gym and run as exercising gets my mind off things, i see doing hard things as a privilege as the struggle makes you forget your own but all other times of the day, ive got nothing to distract me any guidance would be great, i apologise for how long this is and if this is a stupid question or anything i said offends anyone as i know there are people in much worse situations and innocent people dying around the world who would do anything to be in my situation",

    "text": "Hi everyone, Im posting here to get feedback or similar experiences. A few weeks ago I signed up for a 1 trial membership to both Brazzers and Reality Kings through ProBiller. I was then charged several recurring fees, totaling 121.15. I contacted ProBillers support via live chat and spoke to someone who eventually promised me a full refund. I received multiple refund confirmation emails with transaction IDs, stating the refund would be processed in 710 business days. The latest confirmation email also stated the full 121.15 will be refunded. I use Alpha Bank Greece, and I was told it could take up to 10 business days to see the funds. However, after reading some stories online, Im getting a bit anxious. Ive seen posts claiming they were told theyd be refunded but never received anything. So, I just want to ask: - Has anyone actually received their refund from ProBiller in full? - How many business days did it take for it to appear in your account? - Was it credited directly, or did the original charge disappear? Thanks in advance for any help or insights you can offer.",

    "title": "After eighteen years, my father 41M has contacted me 18F, and he wants to meet me, but I dont know if I want to. How do I know how to deal with this?",
    "text": "My father left my mother, and the country before I was born. He never supported my mother to care for me. She didnt know where he had gone, and she couldnt prove paternity. And the people in the court, they looked down on my mother, they didnt believe her, so she couldnt do anything more. Because of this, my mother couldnt be a very good parent. She worked a lot, and I was left alone a lot, since I was really young. I had to learn to cook for myself, and being by myself, it was quite scary a lot of the time, although I did get used to it. Although I never knew my father, I didnt like him. I was made fun of a lot and looked down on, and so was my mother, because she had a child without a husband and he was no longer there. I would lie and say he had died when I was younger, because then you werent made fun of, especially if he had died during service, but people found out eventually. I blamed him for that mostly, because all of my other friends, their fathers had stayed, and I didnt know why mine wouldnt do the same. My mother mostly blamed me for that. But given he hadnt even met me when he left, Id say it seems more like her problem than mine. But recently, he wrote me a letter. He said that he was really sorry, that he thinks about me everyday. But maybe I am being cynical, but I dont believe it. It has been a long time, and he only says this now. I also looked up his address, maybe a bit like a stalker but I think I have the right, and it is in a different country, and it is a very nice house. So obviously, he could have helped me and my mother. And he chose not to. He has a new family now, he said that. A new wife, children. So I question why he is even bothering to contact me, when he has his own perfect life now. He says he wants to meet me. That I can contact him, and he will pay for everything for me to meet him. But I dont even know if I want to. He left me for such a long time, he made my life awful. And I know nothing about him, my mother wont talk about him, and he knows nothing about me. He doesnt know how I look, what I like, what I want to do, nothing. And maybe he wants to know those things, but I dont know. But then if he really didnt like me, he wouldnt want to meet me. I always thought I hated him, and he hated me, because he left, so its almost confusing thinking that actually might not be true. My boyfriend says I just have ideas about him that I have told myself are true, when I have no way of knowing if they are, and he is probably right. But at the same time, it seems like a really big thing to go to a different country on my own, a different continent as well, to meet someone I know almost nothing about. I know hes my father but hes basically a stranger to me. I just feel really nervous about it. I know I look like him, my mother hates that, but other than that, I feel no connection to him. But then I also want to know things about him because I want to know more about me, and I dont know. I havent told my mother that he wrote. I know she would be angry. This is all too much really. I dont know what to do. Its very confusing.",

    "text": "When I was born, I wasnt fair-skinned or considered cute by my family. My maternal aunt and others openly expressed disappointmentfirst because I was a girl they wanted a boy, and then because of how I looked. Ive never seen a baby photo of myself. My parents dont have one so I dont know how bad My look was . My sister even moved in with our maternal grandparents, saying she hated me. My grandmother and mother cried, because Im girl though later my mom admitted it was due to family pressurewhich I understand. Until I turned nine, no one in my maternal or paternal family acknowledged me. They often said to my face how unattractive I was. Then my brother was bornhe and my father are the only ones whove truly adored me. Suddenly, my grandparents changed and became sweet, but my uncle and aunt still made comparisons, calling my siblings more pleasant to look at. At 12, I was sent to boarding school, where my sister also studied. Seniors bullied me badly and framed me. My sister believed them, hit me, and distanced herself. This continued for two years. Once she graduated, the bullying worsenedone night they locked me in a bathroom, destroyed my belongings, and ruined my space. The pandemic brought me home at 15. When I later visited family, they suddenly started calling me beautifulbut it didnt feel like a compliment. I helped my sister through her depression, yet she still says Im selfish, jealous, and shouldnt have been bornall because I told her not to keep asking dad for money. I was 12 when she sided with my bullies, made fun of my looks, and physically hurt me. I supported her during her hard times, but I cant pretend the past never happened. Now Im 19 my family keeps asking how I glowed up and when now Ill find a guy to marry. Their obsession with looks and marriage makes me sick. Now when even some outsider compliment me about something I just think that person is lying or making fun of my looks .I never took compliments as truth they always felt as lie . I dont have much friends and who i have i dont talk to them much yeah maybe were close . Im scared of getting close to anyone. I dont go out, have never dated, and constantly feel like people are judging me. I have deep trust issues. In a few months, Im starting my own software and game development startupbecause now I want to support my family financially, I want to build something on my own. Its been a year since leaving boarding school, but I still struggle with trust and confidence, and I dont want these past traumas to affect my work .",

I then texted him the usual good morning and asked when hed be over today like wed agreed. He texted back that hed been working until 4 a.m., was tired, and I should come over. I also asked him if he was angry and if we could talk today, and he said yes. I also told him that I couldnt eat and that I wasnt feeling well, and he simply ignored me. When I then asked if he loved me, he simply ghosted me. Im really finding myself in a difficult position to decide whether this relationship even makes sense. What do you think, how I should handle the conversation today with him?",

    "text": "TLDR: I had a child at 19 in a very conservative country where being an unwed mother can lead to extreme shame or worse. My parents raised my son as theirs, and I moved to the U.S. to build a life. I married an American man and never told him about my son out of fear and shame. I finally told him after years, and now hes devastated and wont talk to me. I 32F am originally from a very conservative country in Southeast Asia. In my hometown and within my family, having a child outside of marriage is considered deeply shamefulnot just for the woman, but for her entire family. When I got pregnant at 19, my parents were terrified, and honestly, so was I. We made the decision to keep the pregnancy secret. I gave birth in another town, and my parents raised my son now 13 as their own. To the community, hes my younger brother. Only close family members know the truth. The expectation was that Id move on with my life and never speak of it againnot out of cruelty, but because in our culture, that kind of scandal can follow a woman forever. In extreme cases, there have even been honor-based punishments. We dont talk about them openly, but everyone knows. I moved to the U.S. for school at 21, worked hard, and built a stable life here. Ive been financially supporting my son his whole life. Were close, as close as we can be given the distance. He knows Im his mother. I call, I visit, Ive never emotionally abandoned himbut I have kept him a secret from everyone in my life here. Then I met my husband 34M. Hes American, kind, supportive, and open-minded. Weve been married for three years. Hes never been to my country and doesnt speak the language. I told him early on that my family was conservative and private, and he didnt ask too many questions beyond that. I never told him about my son. I wanted to, but I didnt know how. The longer I waited, the more impossible it felt. Last week, I finally told him the truth. I explained everything: how I got pregnant, why my family made the choices they did, how Ive supported my son, and how Ive hated myself for lying all these years. He was shocked. He didnt yell, but he looked broken. He asked, How could you let me build a life with you and not know youre a mother? Hes barely spoken to me since. He says he needs space and time. Now Im being told by friends that Im an asshole for keeping something that big from him. That no amount of cultural context excuses lying to your spouse. But my family says I did what I had to do to protect myself and my son, and that my husband should try to understand the pressure I was under. So now Im torn. I know I wasnt honest, and I hate that. But I also know I wasnt trying to deceive for selfish reasons, I was trying to survive in a world that didnt give me many options.",

    "title": "I 21F am pregnant, and my husband 23M became angry at me because I ate some cake and he said it was not healthy for our baby. Why is he so easily annoyed by me at the moment when I dont think Im doing anything?",
    "text": "We married last year. I became pregnant reasonably soon after that, and I am now three months pregnant. I have mixed feelings about that. I am really happy to be having our child, I have always wanted to be a mother, and it is quite cool knowing that its really happening. But I dont like being pregnant. Ive been feeling unwell for a long time, and while it goes away sometimes, its there most of the time. Im also nervous because on all the scans so far, they are looking very big, and I dont really want to give birth to a baby that is very big because everyone always says how hard it is to give birth, and I dont know, Im just nervous. But I am very excited. And my mother has been very supportive so that is making things easier. But my husband and I had a big argument the other day. I think first that I should explain my eating habits. I have been trying to eat well while I am pregnant, for the health of the baby. I do what the doctors say, the foods that they recommend. And I eat very small amounts of sugar, but that was how my diet was before I was pregnant as well. But I havent been able to always eat a normal number of meals a day, because I feel nauseous a lot, and I hate vomiting. I dont have a fear of it or anything, but I just really dont like it, so if I feel nauseous, I wont eat. So I definitely havent been gaining extra weight, other than the baby and the placenta and things obviously, because that is weight too. So I am not really worried about how I look. Obviously some of my body isnt the best at the moment, but there is nothing wrong with that, I dont think anyone who has been pregnant has looked perfect, because it is a very big process. But anyway, I had woken up in the middle of the night. I went out of our room so I didnt wake my husband, and I was hungry and I really wanted chocolate, so I made one of those cakes in a mug which you microwave. And I know it wasnt healthy, but I didnt feel nauseous, and I hadnt had any sugar that day, so I thought it was fine. Because if you cant eat unhealthy things sometimes, it would be a very sad life. But I suppose he also woke up, and he came out, and got annoyed at me. He said that I need to be responsible and its like I dont care about the health of our child. I was feeling emotional I guess, that is a common theme for my life at the moment, and it scared me, so I cried. And then he got mad because he said I cry all the time unnecessarily and that its annoying. And I know it is but I cant help it sometimes, things just feel really sad sometimes. And it didnt even have that much sugar in it, I halved it, I didnt think it was that bad. Hes also being very irrational, like about my hair, he gets really annoyed about how Im not covering it but Im just at home and I really dont see the point. I do at work and everywhere else. I feel really warm often and that makes it worse, but he goes on about how Im being awful and it just doesnt make sense. But we are both stressed at the moment. We argue often because of this I think. He is very worried about the baby a lot of the time, I dont get to see him sometimes because of his work, and I think that makes him worried more. I worry about him too. And perhaps the whole thing with the cake was also that, because he worries for the baby, but I didnt like how he reacted when I became upset. Sometimes it feels like he doesnt consider that I am actually pregnant and sometimes I feel very weird because of that, and a lot of people do. And I never take it out on him, I would never do that. I just wish he would relax a little bit. I appreciate that he cares, but it makes me very stressed when hes angry at me and I dont like it.",

This year, my brother is preparing for university, and I managed to enroll him in a private prep course. I paid a small part of the tuition upfront, but most of the fee is still unpaid. I promised to pay the rest in installments. I currently work full-time in a bakery without insurance, earning around 600 per month. Out of that, 400 goes to rent and bills. The remaining 200 barely covers food and my brothers needs. Im looking for freelance jobs I can do on the side to support us. Please note that I already work full-time during the day, so I need flexible options I can do at night or on weekends. Any suggestions would mean a lot. Thank you.",

    "title": "I 24F am considering leaving my fiancé 27M. How to know when its time?",
    "text": "Weve been together almost 5 years and engaged for 2. Although we met in college 6 years ago, we started dating the following year and began our relationship with long distance. When I say that us being together was all I had ever wanted, there was no exaggeration. I had DREAMED of this day since we met, but never thought it would happen unless fate got involved. The way I was so in love with him think TSITP with Belly and Conrad even though we went a year without seeing each other or communicating at all. He was my endgame. He struggled with alcoholism and we worked to get him sober which he did and still going strong! We quickly began making plans about the future and everything seemed to just be falling into place. Nothing was wrong wed have little tiffs about random stuff but nothing major until it was. Things changed after that first year of dating when the effort started lacking on his end. I love to show people I care and go above and beyond. He was that way until I graduated a year early from undergrad and then proceeded to law school at the same school. At this point wed been together about a year and a half and now looking back, there were 100 signs then too that I just ignored because of how blinded I was by him. Never bought me flowers until 2 years into dating or planned dates. But when Id bring up how I felt, hed assure me hed try harder, which he would for a while, but then stop. Flash forward to the beginning of law school. He moved to the town I was to be for the next 3 years. We had jokingly talked about this, but it was never a full on convo. He had taken a job so we wouldnt have to do long distance anymore. While I was a lot of emotions, part of me was really hesitant. He hated this town and nothing but bad memories were there this comes into play later. Events began coming up and I was behind invited places. He hated going out to bars or really being with people he didnt know, so Id either go alone or not at all. My birthday came and went, he had forgotten to really do anything for it because he had an event out of town something preplanned and I went out with a group of my friends. For the first time ever, I drank a good bit and one of our mutual guy friends that had known both of us for years made sure I got home. I still remember telling him and crying to him that I wasnt happy but hed moved for me. This was almost 3 years ago. First semester came and went. Christmas happened and he forgot to care just like my birthday. January came and my dad passed away. He didnt know what to do but he stayed with me for 4 days straight. Calling out of work 2 days just to cook and clean and take care of my dog. February came and he bought a house for us to live together in so I didnt have to move and my dog could have a yard. My summer internship however was in his hometown so I was gone for 3 months before returning in August and moving in with him. We then proceeded to get engaged about a month later and wedding planning commenced to get married later this year. I cooked and cleaned and did literally everything in the house. He just paid for it and food. Even when I was deep in finals, I still did everything because if I didnt, he wouldnt. Things never actually got better. I was isolated from friends and I gained about 50lbs this was SO not normal for me. Ive always been so incredibly physically fit He was depressed and hated being in this town. He had no friends there and we spent probably way too much time with one another without breaks. The next summer came and I again had an internship in his hometown and was gone for 3 months. Because of this, we have actually listed his house and I had signed an apartment lease. He was going to move back to his hometown and I was going to finish school. This fell through when the job he accepted dissolved. About a month later, we got a puppy. She was the best thing to ever happen to our other dog. I had lost the 50lbs I gained over the course of 9 months and he began working on himself too. Then my mom got diagnosed with cancer. I was a mess because the thought of losing both parents over the course of 2 years was horrid. My birthday came and he flat out forgot same with Christmas. At this point, I have had I cant tell you how many convos with him about how he just doesnt care and that Ive been heavily been considering leaving. But he always promised hed do better and that hed make sure I knew how much he loved me. I then accept a job offer back in his hometown after the bar exam later this year. We listed the house and sold it and both moved in with our parents my mom had moved to his hometown a couple years prior. Theres no way we could live together with either set of parents with both dogs and my need for a desk/study space. Since moving back, his personality is like night and day. He is the same person he was when I fell in love the first time. Graduation came and while he did get me a necklace, it was so incredibly forced. Like he HAD to do it, not that he wanted to. No flowers at graduation either. Our new house was delayed and while we were supposed to move in 2 weeks from now, its now going to be 6 weeks. This week happened and I just couldnt do it anymore. We had a 2 hour conversation sitting in his car because we have 0 alone time. I expressed how I truly wasnt sure I could marry him after the true lack of care and effort towards anything remotely important or momental for me and how Ive been with a version of him I didnt want to marry longer than Ive been with a version of him I do. He full on accepted accountability and promised he would fix it. I cant help but feel like regardless of what he does Ill never be able to truly love him again. Ive had to lie to friends to make him seem like he does more than he does. I know Ive been unhappy for so long but I also am so scared to leave him. After all, weve been together my entire adult life.",

    "title": "After eighteen years, my father 41M has contacted me 18F, and he wants to meet me, but I dont know if I want to. How do I know how to deal with this?",
    "text": "My father left my mother, and the country before I was born. He never supported my mother to care for me. She didnt know where he had gone, and she couldnt prove paternity. And the people in the court, they looked down on my mother, they didnt believe her, so she couldnt do anything more. Because of this, my mother couldnt be a very good parent. She worked a lot, and I was left alone a lot, since I was really young. I had to learn to cook for myself, and being by myself, it was quite scary a lot of the time, although I did get used to it. Although I never knew my father, I didnt like him. I was made fun of a lot and looked down on, and so was my mother, because she had a child without a husband and he was no longer there. I would lie and say he had died when I was younger, because then you werent made fun of, especially if he had died during service, but people found out eventually. I blamed him for that mostly, because all of my other friends, their fathers had stayed, and I didnt know why mine wouldnt do the same. My mother mostly blamed me for that. But given he hadnt even met me when he left, Id say it seems more like her problem than mine. But recently, he wrote me a letter. He said that he was really sorry, that he thinks about me everyday. But maybe I am being cynical, but I dont believe it. It has been a long time, and he only says this now. I also looked up his address, maybe a bit like a stalker but I think I have the right, and it is in a different country, and it is a very nice house. So obviously, he could have helped me and my mother. And he chose not to. He has a new family now, he said that. A new wife, children. So I question why he is even bothering to contact me, when he has his own perfect life now. He says he wants to meet me. That I can contact him, and he will pay for everything for me to meet him. But I dont even know if I want to. He left me for such a long time, he made my life awful. And I know nothing about him, my mother wont talk about him, and he knows nothing about me. He doesnt know how I look, what I like, what I want to do, nothing. And maybe he wants to know those things, but I dont know. But then if he really didnt like me, he wouldnt want to meet me. I always thought I hated him, and he hated me, because he left, so its almost confusing thinking that actually might not be true. My boyfriend says I just have ideas about him that I have told myself are true, when I have no way of knowing if they are, and he is probably right. But at the same time, it seems like a really big thing to go to a different country on my own, to meet someone I know almost nothing about. I know hes my father but hes basically a stranger to me. I just feel really nervous about it. I know I look like him, my mother hates that, but other than that, I feel no connection to him. But then I also want to know things about him because I want to know more about me, and I dont know. I havent told my mother that he wrote. I know she would be angry. This is all too much really. I dont know what to do. Its very confusing.",

Until now, I have no contact with her.. She told me she finds it difficult to talk to others when she is sad, which is a very alien concept to me, in my mind wouldnt this be the time you need someone close to you to support you.. I still love and trust her, I just need to ask if this is normal behavior or not.. I want to wait, Im very loyal.. and I would never forgive myself for leaving.. I dont want to drive myself insane either or start over analyzing the situation. I will not be answering any irrelevant questions and will delete this post.",

    "text": "This is what someone at a mental health drop in told me she thinks. Like you get rejected from jobs jobs is the context I brought it up in, volunteering opportunities, courses, potential friends, family, support services, potential partners and eventually you wont care or be saddened or stressed by rejection any more? I said I find it to be the opposite having had many 100s of job rejections - more failure makes future ones worse, slowly wears you down and makes you less hopeful and worthy, because youve built up a big negative evidence base and because you keep raising hopes and then being let down, which feels sad and wears you down over time and lowers my motivation and therefore energy especially for things that need steady, sustained energy, like researching jobs and the long application process to try again over the years because it seems quite unlikely to come to fruition, so it takes away the why. I find it gives me the message of not being good enough for anything even though 99 of rejection happens from people who only know you extremely superficially and locked out of normal life - just stuck. A comparable scenario is being psychologically bullied/abused and told youre useless for years - thats a form of rejection, and doesnt seem to make most people care less about future rejection. In my experience the remedy is to build up a positive experience base from little successes, from getting or remembering positive comments from others to counteract the negative on a conscious level first, and then that starts to permeate to the unconscious level. How do you think it is for you? Does more rejection make you not stressed by it any more and make you more hopeful? If so does that come naturally to you or is there some thought process you have that makes it so?",

    "text": "Have known this guy for a little while and we have been slowly getting to know each other. On our first date we both expressed being open and ready for something serious. I got really badly blindsided by my ex partner and it really shook my sense of trust..in the end I felt like he was only really in it because he liked fucking me..that feeling has been hard to shake and Ive been hesitant to sleep with anyone since, for fear of feeling dehumanised. The new guy 43M who Ive just started dating has said since the first date that he would like to see where it goes with me but hes realising hes pretty overwhelmed with life commitments atm and isnt ready to jump into anything serious at this minute. This was all before we had even slept together so I was fine with this..of course we need to spend time getting to know each other. My issue is that after sleeping with him I have this overwhelming feeling of anxiety at the thought of sleeping with anyone casually..but at the same time there is a period of time that I realise it kind of has to be casual. Can anyone relate to this feeling? I dont know what to do..I want to sleep with him more but at the same time the thought of it is making me feel anxious. Sex just doesnt feel casual to me anymore Im just way more sensitive than Ive ever been. Maybe I need to not have sex with him while Im figuring out these feelings..but at the same time I do desire him and it feels like the way to build more intimacy",

    "text": "Me F21 and my bf M22 have been together just over a year, everything has been really good so far, but theres one thing Im starting to realise I wont be able to get over unless I start changing my mindset. His ex used to bully me in school, way before we got together. we used to be super close friends, then she started mixing with the wrong people and she did some extremely humiliating and traumatising things to me that I wont get into but Ive never been able to forgive her for it even though I dont speak to her anymore. When I found out they had dated I wasnt that bothered as my bf has had a lot of exes but only a handful of them were serious relationships, and theirs was one of the more serious ones, she cheated on him but they didnt end on bad terms for some reason, but as youve probably guessed I absolutely hate her for everything she did to me. Me and my bf have never argued, but one major issue weve had is her, because I cant deal with the fact they were together anymore. It started a few months ago when he told me a hoodie he had given to me that I had kept and worn all the time was one that she bought for him. Im a pretty forgiving person and I dont really let things get to me so I was mad for a couple of days then just moved on, it still bothers me but its kind of just something in the back of my mind. Today I had to get an uber home from my bfs house and my driver was her dad, when I got in the car he asked if I was his sister and I hadnt really processed what he said because I was trying to figure out why I recognised him so I just said yes without realising what he had asked me. Then it clicked in my head and I realised who he was.. anyway we spent the whole journey talking about my bfs and his ex gfs relationship. Im just so angry, Im angry at him though and I know I have no reason to be because none of this is his fault but I feel like I cant escape being reminded of her existence when Im with him. I love him so much and he feels the same way but I just dont know what to do. Please help, how do I deal with this?",

    "title": "My friend 35F is talking to 17M. I think its inappropriate she says I shouldnt worry?",
    "text": "Hi. I 30F just found out about this. Heres the context: Good friend of mine who turns 35 very soon posted a story of a screenshot name was redacted in post of a convo with a guy. She captioned it new crush is officially unlocked. There wasnt anything in the convo other than voice memos and music reccs, but naturally I was curious, so I asked for details. She has been hung up on her recent ex, so I was hopeful. She tells me that hes a random guy who reached out to her and they plan to hit a concert together once hes 18. I felt uneasy so I asked how old he is and she said he is 17 but turns 18 soon. Also added they were just chatting, she told them theyre just strictly friends, shes just bored and theyre vibing. I told her she cant be serious and that this was inappropriate and weird, even to be just friends with a random 17 year old online. I said that I would say the same thing to a man her age talking to a 17 year old girl, that this was legally sketchy and to leave him alone. I also wonder if this person is even real or posing to talk to her since the internet is a weird place. Here, she insisted there was no legal issue but potentially an ethical one. Then told me that if I have a problem with it we dont have to talk about it, that she got advice from another friend who said just talking and being friends is fine but they shouldnt meet up. At this point, Im beside myself so I say you literally said you had a crush on him to which she replies I know you think this is super serious so theres nothing I can say thatll please you. I was absolutely floored by this response. My take: It felt like a means to make ME feel bad about what I feel is grooming a child or in the very least an inappropriate friendship. I am also very upset because we recently celebrated a big personal milestone of mine just weeks ago. She has dated a couple of younger men before like 22-23 and I always teased her about it, because thats definitely an age gap, but these are still MEN. I am disgusted and blindsided. I havent replied to her message. I dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to back away from this, because I cannot support this.",
