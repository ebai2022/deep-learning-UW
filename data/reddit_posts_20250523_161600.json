    "text": "Bought a house with my partner a year ago. If we split up, selling the house now would be more costly than profitable. I think. He paid 80 of the upfront costs, and now we split the mortgage 55 / 45. Neither of us could afford this place on our own, but hes closer. If we were to break up, is there a legally safe / even possible way to have it look like: - he lives in the house, Im somewhere I can afford rent my portion of mortgage. He pays 83 of the mortgage, and I pay 17. - I dont pay anything other than my 17 of the mortgage homeowners is included in mortgage. - if costs come up like, new roof I pay 17. - magically Im somehow only 17 owner, and whenever he/we decide to sell, we split the funds 83/17? After he pays himself back some for the upfront - but also Im legally protected from being sued. - and financially protected, to where I have my own separate loan from his - or all this is legally documented somehow. - and we have some kind of notarized legal agreement where this is all written out and able to be upheld? If so, what would it look like? TIA for your thoughts. Location: WA, USA",

    "text": "As the title says, I cheated on my girl for misleading me about having sex for over a year. Following my most recent post, we did talk about the fact that sex was absent between us and I expressed that I would like to leave the topic until we were both ready. However, I think she misunderstood me completely and she would talk about how it would look like and how much Id enjoy it. I know I shouldve broke up with her at this point but I stayed with her because I genuinely thought I liked her that much. Over the past few days, an old fling came into the picture and I decided to act on it. I remember the sex was top tier with her and yesterday, we decided to meet and one thing led to another and we went at it. I should feel guilty for this but at the same time, I feel like its something that Ive needed for a long time. I will be honest with my girl about this and I know its time for us to go our separate ways. I just need to find the nicest way to do it and be somewhat prepared for how she acts out. What is the best way to approach the situation? TLDR: I cheated on my girlfriend after feeling emotionally and physically unfulfilled for over a year. We had talked recently about the lack of sex in our relationship, but I felt misunderstood and stayed longer than I should have. When an old fling came back into my life, I gave in. I do know deep down its time to be honest, take accountability and end things respectfully.",

Ive already paid 6k on it and had it 6 months. Its a 2020 Subaru cross trek with 83,000 miles. I recently have received 10,000 and am wondering if I should use this to pay off the car more or should I trade in the car and then get a car with a better interest rate? My current rate is 7.65.

As soon as I opened the tab, I realized it wasnt cool and was about to close it. But then I noticed one email with no subject line. I didnt click on it or read anything I just casually asked him what it was about. Thats when he completely blew up on me. He said I violated his privacy, was super angry, and things escalated fast. He was really upset, and I get that I was in the wrong for even going into his email in the first place. But I also didnt actually read anything or dig into his stuff I stopped myself before doing more. Im wondering if the level of anger he showed was justified, or if it was an overreaction given what actually happened. Im not trying to dodge blame, I just want some outside perspective on whether this kind of crash-out was fair or a bit extreme.",

    "text": "One of my friends found my journal, and inside was a long rant about everything Ive been feeling. Complex emotions of loneliness, and whatnot, one regarding my other friend who has stuck out with me through thick and thin. I wont go into too much detail, but I just felt excluded in a group as a whole despite being loved in private so I just wanted to share my emotions on that. But the friend who found my journal made my other friend aware, and now I just feel really really accused. My journal contained emotions that were private to me and me only. My rants reflect about only 5 of my identity, yet all the appreciation I have had for my friends completely disappeared because they read a private time of absolute rock bottom. I have now resolved things with my friend, but I feel so shaken because I had my entire moral identity stripped away from me. I felt like such a selfish and horrible person, when I know they based the perspective of me off of something that does not reflect me as an individual fully. But I feel so raw and naked and I feel so targetted as if everyone doesnt have a part of them that they want to hide. It feels so unfair that Im getting beaten over my bad mental health when I hate it more than they do. I dont even let it affect them at all, I dont badger anyone or anything. This was COMPLETELY private and I kept it to myself yet I am still in the wrong. Especially because this one particular friend is known for being nice, so being lashed out by him felt so completely humiliating I really thought I was the worst person alive My self esteem completely sunk to the ground, I really didnt know how to defend myself at all. My friends have such a rotten view of me now, and I can feel their respect for me has completely disappeared, all because of one selfish rant I wrote in a moment of extreme dispair. I dont know how to deal with my mind anymore. All of the effort I spent strengthening my confidence, self confidence and convincing myself that I am not a bad person for prioritising my needs have completely gone down the drain. I feel so, so humiliated",

    "text": "I 24F have been cheated on by my bf 29M. He came clean about it a month back confessed on cheating twice once makeout, and then the next time sex. I have been going through hell since he confessed and Im spiralling bad. He says that Im the love of his life and that he wants a second chance to make things right. However, Im spiralling and just trying to survive for now as this has been pure trauma for me. We had a great relationship where both of us were happy. He told me I made him the happiest and he never loved someone the way he loves me. Although I havent taken any decision what to do next and taking my own sweet time, we are going for couples counselling with his therapist to figure things out. However, my ex 26M checked on me yesterday and wants to catch up next week at a restaurant, to which I said yes to, for now. I might bail out as I need to talk about this in my couples session after 5 days When I informed my bf about it btw, 1 Im single right now, 2 he had given me guilt-free pass to go on dates and explore to figure out what I want, he went bonkers he hates this ex the most and has now accused me of using him as a backup. He lashed out saying how he has been spending so much on couples counselling all this while and that he had been thinking all this while how to fix things between us while he was in his 3-week long foreign trip. We have been having troubles where I had been lashing out on him very frequently, especially that we are distance apart. I cry and keep asking him why he did, and quite often when I used to ask him questions about the infidelity, he used to snap at me while he was at the trip. In the beginning, he was quite remorseful, was wanting to work on things and fix everything for us. For the past few days, he used to snap at me whenever I tried bringing it up, saying he wants to practice compassion with himself and try moving on and forgive himself, while stating that he will help me get over this betrayal too, but I hardly felt like he has been doing so. And now, after telling him that I also wish to meet my ex in order to understand if I wanna go back to the dating pool again, he has been acting crazy and has asked for no-contact until we have our couples session. But he is also saying that theres no point taking couples session if Im single and exploring, and he also needs time and individual sessions to process how he feels about this. What is the right way forward and what can I do? Like can one see other people during separation while having couples counselling to figure out what to do next?",

I was looking for the location of some screws when in the last pages I saw: About 10 names of kids in my school whom I had mentioned to her since when I started high school to about 1.5 ish years ago based on when I would have said the names, random things I had said about kids in my school- one read jenny- big eyelashes, does her makeup in science and there were arrows joining the names to things I had said. Some of the names had descriptions of the kid- one was a whole paragraph saying Spencer- troublemaker, naughty, gets in to trouble, bad influence. Sees my name in hallways and is friends with my name and a bit more. There were a few arrows linking names and descriptions, along with random things I had said about those kids. I put the book back as normal but photoed the pages. I find this really creepy, especially considering I had found a similar thing last year on the family iPad, but that was just a list of 4 names. Is this weird? Am I right to be creeped out?",

    "text": "Hey Reddit, Im trying to stay grounded here but there are so many signs that my boyfriend might be planning to propose and Im spiraling a little. Would love some outside perspective on whether Im reading into things or if this actually sounds like a proposal is coming. So heres the context: Weve been dating for a while, super serious, and weve talked about getting married a ton. A few months ago he said, When we get married next year, but later clarified he meant engaged next year, not married. But then he keeps doing little things that make me feel like he is planning it this year. For example, he asked me to pick between gift 1, 2, or 3, then said he came up with the idea for my Christmas gift based on what I picked. He said I wont be able to reciprocate the gift, which makes it sound pretty major. He smiles or smirks anytime I bring up Christmas and wont tell me what the gift is. Hes been sending me wedding/engagement-related Reels like Things to know if you change your name after marriage. A GRAFF ad luxury jewelry, engagement rings popped up on his Instagram Reels, which seems super targeted. We dont live together, Im not on his WiFi, and he doesnt follow high-end pages. And the kicker: we were with his family, and his mom who had a little wine pulled me aside at a nicer restaurant and said Lets go over here to scope out what it would look like for an engagement party or something. She also said earlier no pressure or anything but I really love hanging out with you. The only thing making me doubt it is that he recently said he doesnt know what will happen with school grad school stuff and said maybe wed get engaged next year instead of this year. But now I cant tell if hes trying to throw me off or just changed his mind. I journaled back in January that I had this weird gut feeling Id get engaged this year, and now all this is happening and I dont know if Im delusional or intuitive. TLDR: My boyfriend has been dropping hints about marriage for months, says he wants to get married next year, and recently told me he has a big Christmas gift planned that I wont be able to reciprocate. His mom made a random comment about an engagement party, and hes been sending me marriage-related Instagram reels. He now says he was just thinking wed get engaged next year, but I feel like that might be a diversion. Am I reading into things or is a proposal actually coming?",

    "text": "Hi guys! Im not really a poster more of a reader so sorry if this seems awkward but I genuinely would like some advice. I was struggling a while back with what I believe in and as of now Im happy being an agnostic theist. The issue is that awhile back I had told my mom that we could go to church if I had known back then what I do now then I would have said no and I told my mom today that I wasnt comfortable anymore going to church because I tried to believe but I just cant. Some background is that I grew up non religious mom was a catholic and dad was something similar not exactly sure what but I guess the beliefs were different so they decided to raise me and my brother non religious. Anyways the reason that she wanted to go back to church is because of my dads infidelity so she thought it would be good to go back to God. So back to the issue, I was telling that genuinely I dont cant find myself to believe anything pertaining to a Catholic so I dont feel comfortable anymore going to a Catholic Church because I wont feel right. I suppose that was the wrong answer because while she said that she understood where I was coming from she thinks I need to go to church. Or at least give it a shot, I genuinely believe that there is a God but I just cant find myself believing the beliefs that Catholics have. All she kept saying was that I needed to go and its not like we go maybe for a month or two, she wants us to go for at least six months before we decide if its for us or not. Maybe my apprehension is what made me angry at her because while she was saying that she understands where Im coming from it felt like she doesnt. She kept saying that she thinks Im just angry at God because of what my dad did. Im not angry at God because of what my dad did, my dad can do whatever he wants and he chose this thats nobodys fault. So Id like to hear what you guys think. Maybe I am overreacting or I went about it the wrong way. My genuine worry is that shell make me grow to resent her and religion in general. Im an adult early twenties but right now I feel like a little kid because shes not respecting my choice as an adult. Any advice on how to handle this issue without making it seem like Im looking down on her would be appreciated.",

She violated her curfew 15 days before completing her supervision. We cant get a direct answer from anyone at the probation office about what is going to happen to her once she turns herself in and she is very worried.

    "text": "I call my grandad my best friend even though we dont speak the same languageIve only seen him twice in my whole life summer 2018 and April this year. I love him with all my heart and hes genuinely the most amazing grandad I could ever ask for but sometimes I do wish he knew English or that I knew their language. I think the reason he might not know English is because he dropped out half way through primary school. I asked my mum why he did that she said its cuz back then they didnt really need it which I found odd but okay. Oh btw the reason Ive only seem him twice is cuz Ive only been to Uganda twice and thats where all of my family live apart from me and my parents and brother. I feel like I could have a closer relationship with him if only we could speak the same language. Im not expecting him to learn English at his age as hes 89 so its not fair on him to have to do that plus the only reason hed ever speak English is cuz of me and my brother. Everyone else in our family including my parents knows Rukiga which is their language and 95 or maybe even more of them know English as well which is great! I feel like I need to do my part as his granddaughter and learn their language as idk how long hes got left to live so I want to have had a proper conversation with him before he goes yk. But learning a new language is really difficult for me and my parents did say theyd teach me but they havent yet so I might have to teach myself but Ive tried and Im struggling. Idk what to do but I just cant imagine not having a proper conversation with my grandad apart from him saying things like how are you, good morning, and goodnight etc. What do I do? TLDR I call my grandad my best friend even though he doesnt speak any English he speaks Rukiga which is the language they speak in Uganda. Is that weird?",

We was just close friends, even my best friend dont mind of that. But in present, Im in so love with her. But I dont know why. Is she beautiful? No. Is she has a good personality? No. Is she so fun to hanging out? No. I would never want to upset my friend. And were in completely different departments now and its like a miracle just to see her, let alone talk to her. But despite everything Ive just said, I cant help myself. For me shes the most beautiful, the most fun, the best girl Ive ever met. Even though my best friend tells me all her bad sides and qualities. Its almost impossible for me to talk to her alone because shes always hanging out with her other friends. I feel like Im walking through a minefield right now. If I make a wrong move, I will cause something I never want. But like I said. I know what Im doing and our feelings are 95 not mutual but I cant stop myself from thinking about her all the time or dreaming that somehow were together, but I shouldnt, because either way the consequences are something I never wanted. And it feels like Ill never find someone like that again in my life.",

    "text": "Before I start explaining my situation I would like to preface that I am not willing to leave my bf or wanting anyone in the comments to tell me to. I 21F and my bf 20M have been dating for 5 months now and we have a very great relationship but its been kinda rocky and I just need some advice. When we first started dating I had mentioned to him how much porn was a problem for me in a relationship. I know that a lot of people will not agree with me and thats okay but I had told him that and he told me that he would stop watching porn and also mentioned that he has a problem with porn but was willing to stop for me. Basically two months in it came out that he had been watching porn the first month of our relationship a few times and it broke my heart because I felt so betrayed and I truly believed him when he told me he stopped. He had told me that it was only the first month and that he slowly started to realize how much it meant to me and he completely stopped after the first month and had been porn free for the whole second month. Were now 5 months in and he promises to me everyday that he has completely stopped for me and that he is willing to do whatever it takes to end up marrying me down the road. I truly believe him when he says he stopped because 1. I have his phone passcode and he is 100 okay with me going through his phone at any moment 2. Hes promised and cried to me and his dad about how serious he is about this and that he is telling me the 100 truth 3. Everyday he shows me how he has changed and I believe him. My problem is that I cant get over some stuff. I interrogate him with in depth questions abt what he used to search up and jerk off to and I know its bad but I cant help it. Last night I had asked him if he ever jerked off to any girls he personally knew before he met me and he said he used to a lot. Idk why but that made me feel really disgusted and I asked him to unfollow any girl he has done that to that he still has followed and he unfollowed around 20 girls. It just makes me feel like he was thirsting to them this whole time behind my back. Not jerking off to them, but still admiring them in that sense. I cant help but feel like Im not special at all. I know Im being crazy and he has told me that he NEVER once did any of that once we started talking and I truly believe him. I just need help with getting over his past and realizing it doesnt matter anymore. Please I need some advice from a man or some reassurance of some sort that he truly does love me and that this shouldnt matter. Something extra I would like to add is that my boyfriend loves me very loud and publicly. He posts me all the time, he has me as his pfp, hes genuinely willing to do whatever it takes to make me happy and he said he is 110 over his porn addiction and hes looked me in my eyes and told me that confidentially and has even said he wishes I could be in his mind because I have made him truly become different in the sense of lusting. Hes even gone into detail about how he mentally and physically could never do that stuff again and how gross he feels abt it. I feel like thats partly because Ive been very hard on him about it. I just hope hes telling me the truth. I want to marry this man.",

    "title": "I 32M am struggling with my manipulative MIL 58F, which is hurting my relationship with my wife 29F How do I set boundaries without hurting my marriage?",
    "text": "Posting from a throwaway My wife and I have been married less than a year. We have a 10-year-old daughter from her previous marriage and just had a baby girl. My wife stays home full-time with the kids, and I work 6 days a week. I love them both deeply. We want peace in our home, but my MILs manipulation, emotional volatility, and need for control are wearing us down. She is a constant in our lives, we probably average seeing her around 5 times a month. And in the NICU, she crossed a line with me But this didnt start there. Heres what built up to that moment. Early on, she called a family meeting with me, my wife, and her two sisters 27F 23F to say we were too focused on each other and needed to drop everything at any moment to focus on our daughter, even during our wedding planning. A few months into us dating, she sent me a text saying its hard for her to share her girls, but that shes okay with me as long as Im good to them and to her. It wasnt support. It was conditional permission, and it made it clear that her acceptance of me could be revoked at any time. Her love comes with strings. She was angry we got married before her other daughter 27F who had been engaged longer and told us not to get pregnant until after that wedding so we wouldnt take attention away. When we did get pregnant, she didnt celebrate at first until she caught herself a little while later. She opposed my parents paying for private school for our daughter, saying shed become a snob. It was for the school that I went to and graduated from. She objected to us doing premarital counseling and the ceremony with a pastor from my familys church. Claimed it would pull us toward their church instead of hers. She pressures our 10-year-old relentlessly for visits even when our daughter says she doesnt want to go. 10 y/o has admitted sometimes she only says yes because she doesnt want to hurt MIL feelings. She insists on seeing her before she goes to her dads, and will text repeatedly until we give in. Holidays are a constant power struggle. MIL demands equal or more time than my family, has said things like thats my grandchild, not theirs, and refuses to adjust her schedule to accommodate ours. Every holiday feels like its about keeping her from being upset not about peace or making memories for our nuclear family. If my wife doesnt answer texts, MIL texts me: Why is she ignoring me? She once said, Everyone has their phone on them. Its not right to be ignored. Shes physically intimidating, she used to grab their faces and put her finger in their face while yelling. She still does this as adults. She did it to my wife not long before our wedding and again to her younger adult siblings just recently. Then finally the NICU My Breaking Point Our baby was admitted to the NICU one night after being home from LD. It was terrifying and I genuinely wasnt sure if we would get to bring her home. All is well now but it was the scariest time of my life. MIL showed up at the ER loudly crying my baby, my baby, drawing attention to herself, not checking on my wife or me. The emotional temperature spiked because of her, not the crisis. Later, she looked at the NICU sign-in sheet and noticed my mom had been there all day at mine and my wifes request. She made a pointed comment in front of my mom, shaming her for being there so long. My mom was so uncomfortable, she apologized and left. When we had to leave the room for them to do a spinal tap and wait outside anxiously, MIL made a comment to us that this might have happened because we keep our house too cold and we shouldve been more careful, causing my wife to get upset. And during this same time, she found out that our 10-year-old was staying with my sister had strep. She insisted she still take her to her own house, even though she planned to come to the hospital. When we told her that wasnt an option because of the risk to our baby, she replied Ill just quarantine her in a room and stay away from her. Even though 10 y/o was safe, happy, and already staying in a house where everyone had already been exposed and treated. It wasnt about the child, it was about control. When I told her that would not be happening and it was final, her siblings called us to ask why we were keeping the 10 y/o from her grandmother. Then it got worse. One evening, my wife and I stepped out for the first time in nearly a week to go to a pharmacy while my mom was there. MIL called once. Declined. Called again. Declined. Then again. My wife answered and said, Please stop calling. Im in the middle of something. Ill call you back. She did call back. To apologize. But MIL cut her off, screaming that she was being rude and disrespectful. My wife tried again to explain, but MIL just berated her. My wife finally said, Forget it, Mom. I cant deal with this with whats going on with our baby, and hung up. My wife who was already struggling broke down and sobbed, something that I had only ever seen her do once before, a couple days earlier in the hospital ER, MIL didnt check in for four days. Not a word. Not a hows the baby? Nothing. Until my wife called her to apologize again. At that moment I stopped pretending, I felt I needed to protect my wife and children from her and was done playing nice. My wife knows her mom is toxic. She sees it. But shes terrified to set boundaries. Shes a SAHM. Her sisters brother are her only friends. And MIL has a long history of turning the siblings against whichever child pushes back. My wife fears if she stands up, shell lose her whole family. Her siblings are pretty great and her dad is a fantastic guy. he just allows his wife to do too much and stays out of it. So she keeps the peace. And I carry the weight. After the NICU, On Easter, we built the whole day around MIL again. She was mad we werent going to her church so she moved up the time of her Easter Lunch to 11 right during the time of he church we were going to go to, I finally said I was tired of it and I didnt want to go at all, my frustration boiling over and communicated poorly. My wife and I had a huge fight. My wife told me I always accuse her mother of ruining our holidays, but I was the one ruining it by complaining. The day was tense all day and it felt like the first crack in our relationship. On Mothers Day a few weeks later, after MIL kept our daughter overnight, she didnt offer to bring her back, just invited us over to get her and for tacos. I didnt want to go. We had already agreed not to spend the day at either parents house at my wifes request. My wife asked for one day of peace and I told my mom we would not be seeing her or my grandmother. My wife said I was being hateful. and we didnt have anything else planned anyways. I had already cooked her breakfast and given her gifts but that was the extent of what I had planned. The fight spiraled and escalated to a point we had never been to where she completely shut me out and didnt speak to me for hours. We always are able to come back together and apologize later but the fights are becoming more and more frequent. I know I am safe and her mom is not so its easier to take frustrations out on me. But that doesnt mean I have to be okay with it or these dynamics. I work hard. I love my wife and daughters. Ive given up everything, friends, hobbies, peace to show up and lead. I dont drink anymore since my wife got pregnant almost a year ago. I dont zone out. I go to work then I come home. I help with everything I can. But I feel like I dont matter unless Im ignoring how I feel. Like Im tolerated only when Im obedient. Like MIL takes up more space in our marriage than I do. MIL and her needs are first, I am second. I also fear my daughters growing up seeing this and thinking its acceptable, or worse normal for people who are supposed to love you to treat you like the MIL does. Im scared Im becoming numb. Just another guy who quietly disappears inside his marriage. I will never leave her, divorce is not an option even if it means sacrificing myself but for now Im still fighting for peace and my voice. TLDR: My MILs emotional manipulation and control are causing constant stress in my marriage. She pressures my wife and 10-year-old daughter, crosses boundaries, and creates drama during critical family moments. I want to protect my wife and kids, but my wife is afraid of losing her family if she stands up to her mother. How can I set firm boundaries with my MIL without ruining my relationship with my wife or the extended family? Thanks for reading. I really needed to get this out.",

I did get fired because of a 3 stroke rule that that have but I worked about half a week plus the first full week that I didnt get paid for so Im 100 sure I should be getting more than 400. Is this something I can come after them for? I wouldnt know how to go about it if I could but I just want to know what I can do about it because I feel like Im getting screwed out of money that I earned.",

    "title": "Pregnant and heartbrokenmy boyfriend broke up with me over his dog after making promises. Feel betrayed? 28/F 40/M",
    "text": "Hi everyone, I really need some perspective. Im pregnant and just got blindsided by a breakup that I truly didnt see comingespecially considering the promises and reassurances my boyfriend gave me leading up to this. Im in my mid-20s, and my boyfriend is about ten years older. Weve been together for a month and a half, and yes, I know that sounds short, but the relationship became serious very quickly. He told me he saw a future with me, that he wanted to marry me, build a family, and that hed never leave me. He reassured me repeatedly, even unprovoked, that I was a priority and that if I were ever to get pregnant, he would choose me and our baby over anything. Those were his exact words. Some backgroundhe has two children from a past relationship hes not involved with something he said he deeply regrets and wouldnt repeat. Hes also not officially legally divorced from his ex-wife, although he calls it basically done. After that relationship ended, he told me he got his dog to prove to himself he could still commit to something. The dog is very high-energy, not well-trained, and honestly doesnt fit his lifestyle. I always felt the dog deserved a family with a backyard and time to train and care for itnot to be stuck in a Tesla for hours while he works, only getting a quick 30-minute walk each day. On top of that, he does jiu-jitsu, works full-time, works out, and was trying to invest time into our relationship. Even he admitted he was stretched thin and had been unintentionally neglecting the dog. Before I found out I was pregnant, we had multiple conversations about it. He told me that he had come to the decision to rehome the dognot because of me, but because hed realized it was the right thing to do. He said it logically didnt make sense for his life and that the dog deserved better. He even shared that he felt guilty for the neglect. That reassured me. I never asked him to chooseI just wanted him to think clearly. And he told me he had. Then, just days after I told him I was pregnant, he broke up with me over text. He said hed been stressed and couldnt go through with rehoming the dog because it would cause him pain and resentment. That he still loves me and sees a future, but he couldnt compromise on this. So now Im pregnant, alone, and trying to understand how someone could do such a complete 180especially after they made such big promises on their own. I feel abandoned. Lied to. He once told me that building a family with me would come before anything else. And now hes gone. I dont even know whats real anymore. Im trying to stay strong and grounded, but part of me is just so heartbroken that I believed someone who had no intention of following through when it counted. wrong for trusting him? Was I asking too much? Any honest advice or reflection would really help. I want to make sense of this so I can move forward without carrying the weight of guilt or confusion. Thank you.",

I get it sometimes when the weather is too hot, or if there are repetitive sounds around me e.g. chewing, snoring, finger tapping. My boyfriend loves to sing. Thats cool. Except its more heavy metal screaming, repetition of the same lyrics, elaborate drum solos and this imitation of deep vibrating bass music. Sometimes wed be walking down the street, Id be enjoying the silence and then hed come out with a drum solo and screaming. Today it was quite unbearable because the weather was hot, we had been stuck on a delayed bus for 45 minutes with no air con, and I just wanted to be home. I told him to please stop. He was doing some kind of bass music impersonation at the pedestrian crossing, I tried to create some space. He followed and did it right next to me. It reached the point where I wanted to cup my hands over my ears and scream in public. Now I realize thats irrational. Of course. Im not trying to be controlling. He says its his way of dealing with stress. But it causes sensory overload for me Weve been together for five years. Its not a dealbreaker, but it is a problem. What can we do?",

To me, its about living life and experiencing things before we are dead or too old to enjoy it anymore. Not sure how to handle things. Part of me is ok with things as they are. Part of me wants to just do it too.",

    "title": "Advice on getting over partners past",
    "text": "PLEASE I NEED ADVICE !! I posted this once but it got removed but i genuinely would like advice on how to move on from my boyfriends past. I 21F and my bf 20M have been dating for 5 months now and we have a very great relationship but its been kinda rocky and I just need some advice. When we first started dating I had mentioned to him how much porn was a problem for me in a relationship. I know that a lot of people will not agree with me and thats okay but I had told him that and he told me that he would stop watching porn and also mentioned that he has a problem with porn but was willing to stop for me. Basically two months in it came out that he had been watching porn the first month of our relationship a few times and it broke my heart because I felt so betrayed and I truly believed him when he told me he stopped. He had told me that it was only the first month and that he slowly started to realize how much it meant to me and he completely stopped after the first month and had been porn free for the whole second month. Were now 5 months in and he promises to me everyday that he has completely stopped for me and that he is willing to do whatever it takes to end up marrying me down the road. I truly believe him when he says he stopped because 1. I have his phone passcode and he is 100 okay with me going through his phone at any moment 2. Hes promised and cried to me and his dad about how serious he is about this and that he is telling me the 100 truth 3. Everyday he shows me how he has changed and I believe him. My problem is that I cant get over some stuff. I interrogate him with in depth questions abt what he used to search up and jerk off to and I know its bad but I cant help it. Last night I had asked him if he ever jerked off to any girls he personally knew before he met me and he said he used to a lot. Idk why but that made me feel really disgusted and I asked him to unfollow any girl he has done that to that he still has followed and he unfollowed around 20 girls. It just makes me feel like he was thirsting to them this whole time behind my back. Not jerking off to them, but still admiring them in that sense. I cant help but feel like Im not special at all. I know Im being crazy and he has told me that he NEVER once did any of that once we started talking and I truly believe him. I just need help with getting over his past and realizing it doesnt matter anymore. Please I need some advice from a man or some reassurance of some sort that he truly does love me and that this shouldnt matter. Something extra I would like to add is that my boyfriend loves me very loud and publicly. He posts me all the time, he has me as his pfp, hes genuinely willing to do whatever it takes to make me happy and he said he is 110 over his porn addiction and hes looked me in my eyes and told me that confidentially and has even said he wishes I could be in his mind because I have made him truly become different in the sense of lusting. Hes even gone into detail about how he mentally and physically could never do that stuff again and how gross he feels abt it. I feel like thats partly because Ive been very hard on him about it. I just hope hes telling me the truth. I want to marry this man.",

    "text": "Hi, I recently started my dream job. The first day I noticed one of my female co workers looking at me. As a side note, she kinda has social anxiety and it shows in her interactions with clients at work. Anyway, I became really great friends with my boss first day as he showed me the ropes and what not. I remember in the afternoon he just showed me some paper work that I needed to fill out. As Im talking and joking with him while filling out the paper work, she goes behind me and awkwardly takes a seat in one of the swivel chairs. I was facing my boss and then she says my name and asks me a question. Ive never had someone completely new let alone a girl try to talk to me while Im not even facing their direction. I spin my chair around and start talking to her. Shes mainly the one asking questions at first. She asks me what I majored in in college, and says I must be really smart I studied electrical engineering, and truthfully Im not as smart as everyone thinks engineers are lol. I probably wouldnt be asking this question if I were. She mentions her friend whos studying EE, and then asks me how my college experience was. Our conversation goes on for a little while and then she asks me if Ill be at this location next week I only work at that company location two days a week, on other days of the week Im at different locations. I told her I wouldnt, and then she looked a little disappointed. All this time she had hardly made eye contact with me and was kinda fidgeting with her legs and hands. Eventually I got up and followed my boss out of that room to work on another project. On my second day of work I almost ran into her three times. Every time she was kinda bashful/shy and apologized immediately. I told her Youre good, its my fault. We didnt get a chance to talk but at the end of the day shes at the back entrance and she kinda nervously asks me how my second day at work was. No one else had asked this. I just need some advice I guess. Theres nice girls who are genuinely caring theyre kinda rare and then theres girls who are nice because theyre interested in you. Personally, I kinda consider any girl who initiates conversations to be the former. Im not the best looking dude, so its just the most logical conclusion. That being considered, I think I genuinely find her attractive and I dont want to make a move just to find out she just thought of me as a friend this has happened too often lol. So any insight is appreciated .",

    "title": "Band invited me to go on tour with them, but expect me to chip in 1,500 in tour costs even though Im not in the band or getting paid for this",
    "text": "I was asked by a band if I could go on tour with them since they needed a drummer. They arent big what so ever, probably play to an average of 5-20 ppl and only have 6 songs, but of course I said yes since this would get me some good touring experience and hopefully give me a lil exposure. I learned their songs and practiced with them at their studio which is two hours away cuz of traffic and brought my whole drum kit with me. At the end of practice they asked me if money would be a problem and that they each usually spend around 1,500 on tour. I thought they were talking about personal expenses like food, drinks, etc, which is fine, but then when I got home I realized they were talking about the actually tour expenses transportation, crew costs, stage clothes, etc. I dont think I should have to pay AT ALL since its not my band, they had planned this tour a while before they even messaged me, they asked for my help to FILL IN as their touring drummer, Im 18 so of course I dont have that kinda money and on top of all that, I wouldnt even have been getting paid. I called the main dude of this band and told him hey, I dont think I should be paying for any of this since Im not in the band and you guys need my help for this one tour. Of course he trys to justify it saying you dont even expect to pay for where your sleeping? or oh, well we wanted you to be a perminent member after thiswhich means being a perminent touring drummer cuz they use midi drums not real recorded drums. He also would try to compare college to paying to go on tour with them saying you pay to go to college so you get experience and learn, this is basically the same thing its not dude, stop bullshitting. I told him that most drummers who help a band out on tour get paid and have their expenses taken care of since its not their band, and he started talking about how those drummer had proven themselves worthy, basically saying I dont deserve to get paid for this and should help pay for it since Im not a super experienced touring drummer. After all that I then realized that Id have to buy 1,500 worth of hard shell cases for my drums, 20 pairs of sticks, extra drum heads, new hi hat, and new hardware stands just to make me going with them possible. So in conclusion I wouldve had to spend 3,000 to go on a tour that isnt mine whatsoever and wouldnt see a single penny of that again since they wouldnt even pay me. Of course I messaged him and sent a very respectful and professional message saying how I dont wanna spend that much on a tour for a band Im not in, and its been 4 days and he has just ghosted me. Very professional for someone who was always saying how professional they were. I just wanted to get some other peoples opinions on this to see if i made the right choice, which I think I did.",

    "text": "Last night the last things we said were just that we love one another. This morning I tried messaging her on Instagram multiple times and she didnt even see my messages. I tried to first message her at 6am. I even messaged her hows your day been? Are you okay? I clicked on her profile and all of her posts were gone. I couldnt even follow her back again and soon the page refreshed and said her profile doesnt exist. We met on reddit so I decided Ill try to message her there so I do and Im practically begging her to just say something. She hadnt deleted her reddit account yet but I cant follow her there either and all her posts there are gone too. I looked up if she has a YouTube channel and she has one short and I commented that I said please talk to me. I just need to know. Ive been dealing with a sprained ankle for the past few days while Im in a terrible financial situation with my family. So much stuff I would tell her about our situation and she seemed so understanding of it. Weve only known each other for a week and we both were so hesitant to even admit our feelings to each other. Were so alike but the one thing that separates us is that she doesnt see things the way I do. I have a much more self aware, caring, mature viewpoint of myself than she does of herself. I shared with her my hopes, my dreams. I asked her what she wants to do with her life and she said she didnt know. I even told her that its not a bad thing to not have figured it out yet. Did she leave me because she thinks shes not good enough for me? Weve seen each others faces and she didnt think I found her to be attractive. I told her that she is beautiful. That looks dont matter if you truly love someone for who they are. I feel like I couldve done more to help her. To motivate her and inspire her. I know now that she just thought about how shes not like me in my thinking and wishes she was. Now shes gone. My first ever girlfriend in my life at 22 and I never even got to meet her in person, kiss her, hug her, and just look at her. What could I have done differently? I know its stupid to just take a chance on someone you meet online. She even told me how she also never kissed anymore before. That her last boyfriend who she met online just kept ghosting her and just left her. Me her would talk for hours at a time everyday for a week. Why couldnt she just tell me goodbye? Or just anything than just leave me confused and feeling just horrible.",

    "text": "I have a 2018 Ford Escape that flutters when driving. More so as the car warms up. I had it at my mechanic to fix the cv axle and new brakes. He tested everything but no codes came up, also no engine lights popping up. He suggested taking it to a Ford dealership to have them test it but they charge 200 just for the test. Im on disability and barely make ends meet so I also do Grubhub to pay bills and groceries so definitely need my car. Any suggestions on what could be causing the flutter and does anyone know if there are any agencies that help pay for car repairs? Thank you in advance!",

Im not sure if this is something guys do or ??? Then I talked about how Aiden was supposed to graduate soon and he messed his whole life up , then my brother said when Aiden gets out of jail he wanted to ask Aiden how it felt to shoot someone , I guess I made a weird face, then my brother starting backtracking saying about how it felt after, like did he panic or have a immediate remorse not sure if I was thinking about his response too hard after being weirded out by his fantasies Then I started talking about feeling bad for the victim and their family, then my brother said Aiden mustve had a reason to do it he wouldnt just shoot someone if they didnt do anything to him - I brought up how Aiden was around gangs and sold drugs etc and that he already shot a bystander in a drive by but didnt get caught , obviously he doesnt need a reason- then my brother started speaking about me talking bad about family and bringing up childhood memories involving Aiden , but obviously Aiden isnt the same anymore. I just dropped the conversation",

Imynot sure if itll help with context but yeah Weve been friends for 5 years and she knows me more than anyone. I recently started dating my boyfriend and I love him a lot, but my friend blocked me when I told her because he had allegations that he had almost had sex with a girl who was drunk at a party. I got with him knowing this because I didnt even know if it was true, it was just a rumor. Today I had asked him and some friends whove known him about it and they said these allegations were false. I had let her and another friend who Im also close with in a group chat we have together since he had sided with her that it was false. It now has lead to them saying Im acting out of character than I normally do and have my morals mixed up because I still got with him despite knowing about the rumor before I found out it was false. My best friend has expressed that if I dont break up with him then shell go no contact with me for good and we wont be friends anymore. I dont know what to do because I dont want to break up with him, I love him, but I also dont want to lose my best friend because of this. I tried to talk with her, letting her know I wouldnt know how to go about my life if I stopped being friends with her and our close friend because theyre the only friends Ive had for so long and that I spend time with like that, but she is set on dropping me if I dont leave him. How do I go about this",

Long story short, after getting to the route of the problem, this results as a deep seeded need for female attention/ affection. Satisfaction. Etc. He has been caught in HD at this point. This has been happening for most of our relationship. I, despite what he says, believe this has been happening for him for many years. He has recently dove into a porn addiction as well, probably something that fluctuates in severity over years as well. Obviously this is a marriage and im not perfect, but I dont think anything i could/nt do would change him. The question: Ive never stepped out of our relationship. I love him unfortunately more than I ever have and hes my best friend. But now I want to put myself out there. Im attractive and get hit on constantly. Im in a state of fuck it behavior. I feel like hes been satisfying himself, why shouldnt I? 37F",

    "title": "I ftm24 and my girlfriend f25 of five years are taking a break for memorial day weekend and we both need to figure out what the correct next step is. No bad blood, we support each other fully but are we making the correct choice?",
    "text": "There are a million reasons behind each choice in this story and I will do my best to break everything down but seeing as I am stuck at my mom and dads for the weekend with nothing but my thoughts, I plan to answer any questions that come up this weekend, I guess I am just looking for advice, in alot of different areas really. I am a female-to-male trans man that uses he/him pronouns, if you will be unable to respect me or my relationship due to this, please just keep scrolling. For those of you that stayed, hope you are buckled up. I met my girlfriend lets call her Jill when I was 19, at college. I started hormones when I was 18 and moved out of my parents house as they were not exactly supportive. College was one of the first times in my life I was living fully as myself, without anyone around who knew me pre-transition. I passed well and most people in school had no idea I was trans until I chose to disclose this. I met my girlfriend and we fell hard fast. Without fully being able to be who I am before moving out at 18, I had never dated or been with anyone for pure discomfort in my body. I opened up to her and she fully accepted me, we became each others safe spaces and began spending all of our time in my dorm, skipping classes and skimming by as much as possible to spend more time with each other. We had more sex then I can explain. We were infatuated. She basically moved in immediately. A few months into this, Covid hit and the school shut down. This only fueled our constant need to be together and we quarantined together for months. My parents, as I said before have struggled with my transition since I came out at 15. I was raised Catholic and I fought for myself and who I know myself to be for years, but it all came to a head at school when my parents threatened to stop helping me financially unless I stop taking testosterone. This was not new behavior as they used their financial support as leverage on anything and everything they deemed acceptable. They made a deal with me and my siblings to pay for half of our schooling if we follow certain rules. This started as things like no tattoos yes I know this is pretty extreme but they expanded that to any instance where they didnt like my choices. Safe to say we hid it from them for years that we were living together. I went home one weekend and me and my parents had a fight to end all fights and I saw very clearly that the only way they were going to respect me and realize that I know this is the right choice for me would be to put my foot down and cut contact for a while. I moved in with Jill and her parents at this time and they helped support me through an intense 6 months of emotional communication with my parents until we began speaking again. That was a few years ago now and I am happy to say we have a much much much better relationship now, they still struggle at points but they know where I stand and they respect that, as well as respecting me. I left school as it didnt make sense for me to pay fully if I was still undecided on what I wanted to do with my life. Jill and I moved to her home town and have been living there for the past several years. She works a factory job that she really enjoys and I recently started a remote work from home position. We have a comfortable home and ended up getting 2 cats since we moved in. I cant stress enough how at home this space has become for us both and how much we both needed a place where we can be fully safe and ourselves in. We have always been adamant that communication is key and we talk about everything. One point of contention has been sex. Sex has always been a very important part of a relationship for me. I lost my virginity to Jill but she was in school a year before me and had spent that time sleeping around and exploring her sexuality. Jill opened up to me early on about past childhood sexual trauma that she experienced and still very much affects her to this day. I have been clear never to force or put her in a situation that would make her uncomfortable. I have been supportive of her going to therapy for years to begin to work through the remains of the trauma. When we first started dating, we were having sex constantly we both enjoyed having fun with someone we felt fully safe with. As time went on and the honeymoon period faded, sex became more and more rare and I watched as she began to resign to the fact that she practically never wanted sex anymore and I was struggling with never feeling attractive anymore and going without sex for weeks at a time. We have had countless conversations about being clear that I never wanted her to do anything she didnt want to do, but that I was also struggling with our lack of intimacy. She didnt pursue therapy for several years while this tension kept building and building. We had talked about an open relationship because I never had the experience of sleeping with other people the way she had and that we want me to be able to have that experience but it was always stressed to me that she was satisfied with her experiences and only wanted to be with me, but it would be an option for me to try different things in the future. This is also made difficult because I have yet to have top surgery and being intimate with someone and being comfortable at the same time has always seemed so impossible outside of Jill. Top surgery is a necessity for me and body dysmorphia effects me constantly from what I wear, to how I interact with people. The only reason Jill was able to overcome this hurdle with me and make me comfortable enough to lose my virginity was because of how close we got in such a short amount of time. It was still a slow and scary process to open up so when I think of something like a one night stand with a stranger, it feels impossible and horrifying. Just a few weeks ago I was going on a trip to visit family and had to stay in a hotel overnight by myself. While driving down I made a reddit post different account about being a trans guy in _____ area that does not have alot of experience but wants to try sex with a cis man if there was any in the area interested. To my surprise I got alot of responses and before I did anything else I called Jill. I had no intention of cheating or hiding anything and I told her what I posted and that I think this could be a good experience for me. I had thought about it alot and was careful to be with someone in a random state that I would never see again in hopes that it would relieve any anxiety about trying sex with other people. She told me she supported it and was only scared for my safety. I ended up meeting a guy at a hotel and I gave her the address while she was tracking my phone. We had sex but it wasnt intimate and there was no kissing, as I wasnt interested in that. Things went fine I just hit a point where I realized I wasnt really enjoying myself so I left pretty quick. I called and talked to Jill immediatly and needed to unpack and just laugh at myself for the whole situation but I could tell immediately that this was a mistake as I could hear how upset she was, even while she was trying to hide it. I finished my trip and came home a week later, this is when everything seemingly hit the fan. After having sex when I got back, she said she had something to tell me. She had started texting with a coworker while I was gone and he was openly flirting with her. She said she didnt flirt back but also didnt shut it down. When I asked to see the messages she said she had panicked and deleted them. We had a pretty big fight and came very close to ending things. She tried to compare me not sharing my hookup messages to this situation. I told her I didnt share the reddit messages because it was talking about having sex with another person, there would be nothing but hurt for her if she chose to read them. This situation however, was with a coworker that I have never met and she sees regularly and it wasnt a one time experience but openly flirting. Plus if everything she said was true, and she didnt return the sentiment, then what would I have to be upset about? We slowly got our footing back over the next few days and then she comes up to me and asks if we can loan this coworker some money, as he was in a tough spot. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that has he had known about me during the entire situation and still decided to pursue Jill. She said ok and I thought the situation was finished until I find out later that she had already sent him the money since she was anticipating me not caring. Little lies or secrets like this keep coming to light from her ever since my reddit hookup and its clear that it had much more of an effect on her than we originally thought. Also since that expereince she has not stopped talking about how she wants to sleep with other people as well. I want to be clear, I am not a hypocrite that thinks I can sleep with other people and she cant. I would fully support her if we want to try an open relationship, its just such a 180 from what she had always told me previously. That she was only interested sleeping with me and that she was satisfied with her past experiences and only wanted me to try a few times so as not to go to my grave regretting not trying something. We talked for hours and came to the conclusion that we would not pursue sleeping with other people right now as my trust had been shaken lately in a few different experiences and we both wanted to feel solid before we try anything new. I left the conversation feeling better until a few days later all the sudden she brings up how sleeping around is something she wants to try soon. I was confused after our last conversation, and it was another instance where my comfort and security in the relationship was shaken in the course of a few days. To add insult to injury, she says she was talking about this want with a friend and they had been considering asking the coworker that had almost broken us up less than 2 weeks prior. I was hurt and she was shocked until I explained all of this to her and she only then saw how this might be hurtful to me. She struggles with anxiety and a one night stand with a stranger is something she wouldnt be interested in. So the only experiences she wants are with people she already knows and trusts, which also feels very different to me. Sleeping with random strangers is one thing but sleeping with a coworker who knowingly caused a giant rift in the relationship recently is very much another. We have been trying to get back to normal for days but she has made it clear that this is all of a sudden something she feels she needs to pursue. We said a tearful goodbye today after agreeing to take the weekend apart and consider what we both want, that being staying together or not. Our lease is up in a few months and we have a place picked out that is perfect if we stay together, and another that she would rent solo if we were to choose to end things or take a longer break. Everything after leaving school has taken place in her home town with her family all nearby. She grew up there and also has friends locally, but when I moved there with her I had no one but her that I knew in the area. After quarantine during covid and years passing, I slowly lost contact with friends and have become more and more of a hermit. I have always dreamed of converting a van and traveling the country at some point in my life and we have talked in the past about her staying in town while I go travel for a week or two then come back home for a week or two. Travel isnt something that is as important to her at the moment but she has always suppported me pursuing it. An added struggle is the current stance of the U.S. on trans rights and trans human beings in general. This has always been a dream but I am scared for my safety. Im scared for the relationship that means more to me than anything else. I am scared of being alone again for the first time in 5 years. I am scared of never finding someone who feels the same way about me. I know this is my first heartbreak, and everyone goes through this but I have a constant fear of never finding someone who fully accepts and loves me and makes me feel so at home. Everything in this moment seems overwhelming and impossible. This feels like a big moment for us to choose what our lives will look like and we are both heart broken and hurting. Do we stay together and figure things out or do we go our separate ways, at least for now and see what that looks like? Do we stay together but no longer live together? Will we ever get back to me feeling like I can trust her again? How do I even start the process of traveling in a van? This doesnt even begin to talk about my desperate want to create something again. To do something that helps others and is meaningful to me. I know I am destined to do something with my life but I have no idea what that looks like or how to move towards it. Whatever advice anyone has would be much appreciated and I will do my best to clarify and answer any questions I can. I want to stress that there is no doubt between us that we love each other and just want the other to be happy. Even if we dont end up together, we have had many conversations about being in each others live no matter what steps we take next but I still am experiencing some of the most intense fear and confusion I have ever had. Help with any aspect of this would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading.",

    "text": "Im 23f, working full time as a software engineer at 45k in London. My parents live in zone 6 west and I would like to move out to reduce commute and live like an adult. Ive managed to save up just over 25k towards my deposit for my own flat but I really need to prioritise a higher salary. I work from 8-6 9-5 officially but Ive picked up committee and competition work to increase chances of promotion and I am completing unit 2 of the IMC having sat unit 1 in nov. My parents and I get along fairly well so long as I dont go out. I cant be honest with them about going to a concert as they wont approve I usually tell them Im at dinner w a friend. When I was doing a placement year at 21 earning 23k I did it in London and there was a point where they used physical punishment for staying out late. I was grounded in March over a similar issue and the situation was so ridiculous I decided to j bite the bullet and get on with moving out. While they havent tried that with me since I graduated - I dont trust that they wont do it again if they feel Im not in a place financially to leave. Their main concerns are that Im wasting my money and will never have enough to save. Ive found a place with a friend where my rent will be 900 in Canning Town. Really nice flat that their sibling owns. My budget will be tighter than Im used to but I will greatly enjoy cutting my commute to Canary Wharf 1.5 hrs each way and not being exceedingly anxious every time I want to go out. Need some feedback as I have a week left to go and my parents are constantly going on about affordability! P.s. I also have adhd so sleep deprivation has been a huge barrier and being closer to work would really help out",

    "text": "I was asked by a band if I could go on tour with them since they needed a drummer. They arent big what so ever, probably play to an average of 5-20 ppl and only have 6 songs, but of course I said yes since this would get me some good touring experience and hopefully give me a lil exposure. I learned their songs and practiced with them at their studio which is two hours away cuz of traffic and brought my whole drum kit with me. At the end of practice they asked me if money would be a problem and that they each usually spend around 1,500 on tour. I thought they were talking about personal expenses like food, drinks, etc, which is fine, but then when I got home I realized they were talking about the actually tour expenses transportation, crew costs, stage clothes, etc. Its not my band, they had planned this tour a while before they even messaged me, they asked for my help to FILL IN as their touring drummer, Im 18 so of course I dont have that kinda money and on top of all that, I wouldnt even have been getting paid. I called the main dude of this band and told him hey, I dont know if I should be paying for any of this since Im not in the band and you guys need my help for this one tour. Of course he trys to justify it saying you dont even expect to pay for where your sleeping? or oh, well we wanted you to be a perminent member after thiswhich means being a perminent touring drummer cuz they use midi drums not real recorded drums. He also would try to compare college to paying to go on tour with them saying you pay to go to college so you get experience and learn, this is basically the same thing its not dude, stop bullshitting. I told him that most drummers who help a band out on tour get paid and have their expenses taken care of since its not their band, and he started talking about how those drummer had proven themselves worthy, basically saying I dont deserve to get paid for this and should help pay for it since Im not a super experienced touring drummer. After all that I then realized that Id have to buy 1,500 worth of hard shell cases for my drums, 20 pairs of sticks, extra drum heads, new hi hat, and new hardware stands just to make me going with them possible. So in conclusion I wouldve had to spend 3,000 to go on a tour that isnt mine whatsoever and wouldnt see a single penny of that again since they wouldnt even pay me.",
