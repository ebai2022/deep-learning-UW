    "text": "Programming beginners sometimes get stuck because they want to build great things, without dominating the basics. Experienced programmers, on the other hand, sometimes get bored because they are not having as much fun as they used to, and start looking for small projects. Well Im here to present to you TRMNL. A Ruby-powered e-ink dashboard weve been working on. Rails plugins hardware the fun side of Ruby Full disclaimer: I work at TRMNL. We are a small team, but I think we built something cool. TRMNL is mostly open-source and runs Ruby under the hood. Being open-source, we pledged to keep the project alive, even if we go bankrupt as a company. You wont be left with a useless device you bought: https://usetrmnl.com/blog/the-unbrickable-pledgehttps://usetrmnl.com/blog/the-unbrickable-pledge I think TRMNL shows Ruby used in a new way. But you dont need to be a Rubyist to have fun with it more on this below. At its core, TRMNL is a distraction-free desk device that displays your calendar, reminders, notes, etchttps://usetrmnl.com/integrations/. Heres how we use Ruby: Backend: We use Rails to power the devices setup page web app. Plugins: You can write plugins in Ruby or any language to fetch, format, and display dataGitHub alerts, Home Assistant stats, or a countdown to your next deploy. Plugin format: Just HTML, CSS, JS, and a JSON payload. If you can build a static web page, you can build a plugin. For more context, heres a video of someone building one using Node.Jshttp://node.js If youre new to coding, TRMNL is a friendly way to write real-world code that runs on a real device. If youre more experienced, its a chance to build neat tools for any user, using any language you prefer. Check these examples: https://usetrmnl.com/recipeshttps://usetrmnl.com/recipes If youre learning to code and want to tinker with something, or youve been around the block and miss the fun side of programming, this could be a nice little playground. Heres our open-source server client, also in Ruby Hanami: https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanamihttps://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami We also have an OSS server client in Ruby Sinatra, but the one linked above is much better Happy to answer any questions about how it works or where were heading with it. The objective of the post was to let you guys know that TRMNL exists, and since our Discord community is full of people having fun, I thought it would be interesting to you.
