    "title": "Im worried about my future and life in general. Can anyone help me?",
    "text": "In my younger years I had always envisioned being a software engineer coz I was a geek since childhood, but when COVID struck in 2020 it really halted everything, including my high school education I had to wait 2 years so I could head back finish my final year of high school in 2022. By 2022, quite frankly, my passion had really shifted towards cars since I had plenty of time to be enthralled and learn so much about cars during the super long COVID break, mostly picking my inspiration from the best of Western TV and automotive culture think Wheeler Dealers with Mike Brewer Ed China, Ant Anstead, F1 Elvis...Overhaulin with Chip Foose, Texas Metal, Shindig, Donut Media, MotorTrend, Discovery UK, etc. etc. lots of personal endeavors like researching and scouring the internet A LOT for automotive knowledge of course. I didnt do too well after high school, partly attributed to being away from studies for years, so I couldnt get into college. That didnt fuzz me though coz my passions had already shifted to automotive repair and I knew I didnt really need to head to college to be an automotive technician. So I picked myself up and went to trade school, where I had my automotive technician apprenticeship under a prestigious Mercedes-Benz AG franchise dealer with other volume franchises on the side too including FCA now Stellantis. It went well, graduated top of my class, but unfortunately wasnt retained due to the super high employee retention rate at the dealer respected family-owned business so service advisors, techs, etc. are generally happy and have no reason to seek greener pastures, meaning there are hardly any slots to fill at all. I worked briefly with an indie shop after that as a diagnostic tech, however I left sooner due to ridiculously-poor pay was barely enough to survive, then tried getting into dealers but with no luck. Dealers pay more than indies here in Uganda Eastern Africa by the countrys industry standard, but getting into a dealer here is comparatively as difficult as getting into an Ivy league college in the States. Many of the dealers are highly-competitive to get into and have seriously high employee retention rates, and coupled with the issue of Africas automotive landscape still being quite underdeveloped and backward many people still driving old beat-up Japanese cars, this makes it even harder for dealers to have workloads high enough to require hiring more techs regularly. Where that leaves me is a position of uncertainty, constant anxiety, and worry about my future because being a tech is what Im truly passionate about, but there are apparently next to 0 chances of living that dream at this point here in Uganda. Ive tried getting into the States and Europe any better part of the world really as a skilled worker, mostly because I actually feel like Im better-suited for these places having mostly ever dreamt of being like all my inspirations from these parts of the world--but getting into these countries is difficult enough it always leaves me bamboozled and wishing I could just teleport into these countries and somehow start a reasonable life there because I actually know what I want to do, but I just cant get through. I dont even know a soul out there that could help me. I just really need all the help I can get at this point because Im going slightly mad, I think.",

    "text": "Hi all, Im 31F, and my partner 30M and I have been together for a year, long-distance for the past 8 months while hes in another state completing a PhD. Our relationship is deeply loving, stable, and supportive. Hes my best friend and makes me feel safe in a way no one else ever has. But now hes asking me to move to his city, and Im torn. There are some major long-term differences between us, and Im struggling to figure out how to move forward: - He is firmly child-free. Im unsure, but leaning toward wanting kids one day. If I were with someone who wanted them, I think Id be a clear yes. - I was hoping one of us might changemaybe Id feel okay without kids, or maybe hed open up to the idea. But Ive realized I cant authentically say no to the possibility of kids right now, and I dont know what that means for our future. - Our lifestyles are also quite different. Im very outdoorsy climbing, camping, snowboarding, and hes more of a homebody. These things are a big part of how I connect with others, and sometimes I wish we were more aligned there. - I have a strong community and a fulfilling job in my current city. Moving would mean starting over, and my field social work has fewer opportunities where he lives. He feels like we cant keep progressing without a decision to move, and I feel a lot of pressure to figure it out quicklyeven though Im still trying to work through my feelings. Hes beginning to wonder if our long-term visions are just too different. Im trying to get clearer on what steps I can take now to figure this out. Have others navigated something similardeciding whether to move forward despite key long-term differences, or how to explore what you really want especially around kids? How do you weigh a strong, loving relationship against potential incompatibilities? Any advice or experience would helpI feel stuck and overwhelmed.",

    "text": "Hello fellow Redditors. Ive been holding all of this in for too long and I just need to talk to someone. I 33M am married to a man I love deeply, lets call him Jake 34M, but were in a situation that feels impossible, and I genuinely dont know what to do anymore. Were currently living in a small, government-subsidized studio apartmentme, Jakes two kids 8 and 3, and Jake unofficially. He cant be on the lease due to an old DCFS case that wasnt entirely his fault, but still has consequences. Because of that, everything about our living situation feels like were walking a tightrope. The oldest child sleeps on the couch because having a bed here for him would signal to housing authorities that someone else is living here. Hes noticeably upset about it, and I dont blame him at all. I love these kids with everything in me, but as their stepdad, I constantly feel guilty correcting them or stepping in when theres a behavior issue. Jake loves them so much that he struggles to tell them no, and I get itbut its becoming a pattern. Their behavior is getting worse because they know hell cave, and Im left feeling like the bad guy every time I try to set a boundary. Financially, were barely holding it together. I just finished my masters degree in business analytics, but I havent been able to find a job. Its crushing my self-esteem. I feel like a burden. I feel like a failure. I have to ask for help just to meet basic needs, and it makes me feel like less of a person. On top of all that, Jake and I both use something called 7-tabz basically kratom. It started as a way to cope, but now its become a serious addiction. I want to stopIm fully aware of how harmful it isbut Jake insists its harmless and refuses to acknowledge the impact its having. He spends money we dont have on it constantly, and every time I try to bring it up, he either deflects or shuts down. Jake is bipolar and takes medication for it, but he also struggles with other serious health problemsnerve pain, epilepsy, sleep apnea, and more. I know hes overwhelmed, but his mood swings make it hard to know where I stand. Sometimes hes loving and supportive. Other times, it feels like hes distant or angry for no reason. I know he loves me, but its hard not to internalize those moments and start to question myself. Mentally, Im not in a good place. Ive felt near-suicidal at times. I havent told him that, because last year he lost his best friend to suicide, and I feel incredibly guilty even thinking those thoughts, let alone speaking them out loud. But the truth is, I feel trappedby our situation, by my own shame, and by the weight of trying to hold everything together. My family my step dad specifically - who highly influences my mom isnt supportive of our relationship because were gay, so I dont have much of a safety net. And Im not perfectIve made mistakes, Ive said things I regretbut I love Jake. I love these kids. I just dont know how to keep going like this, and I feel completely alone. My question is this: How can I protect my mental health and try to get back on my feet when my partner isnt on the same page about addiction, boundaries with the kids, or how serious things are? Is this worth it? If youve been in a similar situationor have any advice on managing this kind of imbalance in a relationshipI would really appreciate your perspective. Please be kind. Im really struggling.",

    "text": "I 18m met this guy on a dating app and things seemed to go really well. We got along and he is a genuinely good guy. He told me he wanted to take things slow and I agreed. Very quickly however, he began getting sexual. I didnt mind but I told him I didnt want to send pictures until I was in a relationship. He seemed okay with this but later told me he didnt get why I was being so strict. I am also religious, and while I dont agree that it is bad to be gay I do struggle with it. He asked me to be his boyfriend and I agreed. I told him however that I was still unsure about pictures because I realized my religion is more of a struggle than I thought. He seems very upset by this and we have been arguing ever since. He says I cant fully commit to him, but I told him I am committed. I explained that just because I wasnt ready to do sexual things doesnt mean I wasnt committed and that I needed to work things out before we could do anything of that nature. I told him eventually I would be ready but I didnt know when that would be. He still isnt understanding. He says I dont seem ready to be with him and that I shouldnt have joined a dating app. He said he wants to make things work, but keeps pushing this issue. I really like him and also want to make things work but at this point I dont see that happening. Should I keep fighting this issue? Or should I end things altogether? I feel that he wont budge on this and it may not be worth my time.",

I have driven past this box a hundred times taking my kids to school and usually move over a bit because it is literally right against the pavement, but today there was a dog in the road and I was slowing to try to not hit the dog.... Anyway, I forgot to move and this mailbox absolutely wrecked the side of my van. Why? Because the owner welded a huge steel cage around in because I got tired of people hitting it all the time. There was no damage to his box. My car had to be towed and now I have a 1k deductible to pay. Do I have any recourse here? I was not cited by the police, but the dude outright admitted the box was too close and hed put the cage on it because it kept getting hit. Im a little ticked off about that, careless and frankly, cant afford this deductible. Am I being unreasonable?",

    "text": "TLDR: dad and i got a car together and wanted it to be special, he moved far away and wants to pay off the rest of the car and keep it, even though ive paid all the payments thus far. Apologies for formatting, this is my first time posting to a sub like this and im on mobile. Alright so, back in 2022 my dad and i came to an agreement where we could get a car together that we both would love and it would kinda be our thing. i was living with him at the time, so the agreement was my form of rent would be the car paymentinsurance. he said whenever parted ways and move into different places i could keep the car no questions asked. its a pretty nice sports car, i love the car and whatnot and so does he. thats the background for the car. In october, with a months notice he decided he was going to move 2000 miles away, long story short i had no money set aside to get my own place. the time for him to leave came and i ended up moving in with my sister and couldnt get a job. Finally in february i got a job where id be gone for around a month and a half then id get a week off. He asked if i wanted him to look after the car while i was working this job and i could go stay with him on my off time. thats what we did. now he is talking about he and his new woman want to pay off the car and keep it. In all honesty i would be okay with that if i could get a car myself, but due to the fact i couldnt get a job for around 3 months my credit went to shit and i dont think ill be able to get another car. so if he does that i wont have a vehicle when i do decide to move into my own place. He claims he will help me when that time comes but im skeptical. considering ive put at least 15k of my own money into this car through the times we have owned it doesnt seem fair for him to decide to do that. what can i do? im so sorry for the wall of text i hope someone can understand and help me out here",

Story Time: I 29M have frequented a small business in my neighborhood for a long time and have a friendly relationship with all of the employees first name basis type deal. Recently they hired a new person 24F and I feel like we instantly connected. When I pop in, well sit there and talk all night until they close. We share a ton in common and play some of the same games. I asked if shed ever want to play something to which she agreed and we exchanged numbers and a few messages thereafter. After some back and forth she stopped texting me, but will still talk to me all the way up until closing when I come into her work. Id like to talk to and get to know them more but Im unsure if Im reading the room wrong. Is there something Im missing or should I just let it go? TLDR: met someone I like, exchanged numbers, she stopped texting me, but still shares long conversations with me when I see her at her work. What should I do?",

    "text": "We saw each other after 2 yrs of being broke up and were together for close to 2 yrs also. Anyways was talking to another girl she invited me to a concert that was weekend long. Found a Facebook friend selling a ticket which was my exes mom she sold me the ticket and I met her there to pay her for it. She asked if I knew anyone there I said no and she asked if I wanted to hang out with her and my ex if it was ok with my ex of course! Well my ex had me blocked on everything so couldnt ask her. Her mom finally asked her when she got of the phone with her current boyfriend and she said yes! Long story short I blew the other girl off hung out with my who I still very much love! We held hands, danced, embraced each other throughout the concert. Day after she breaks up with her boyfriend who was mad she was there cause he didnt like her moms boyfriend. He called her 97 times during the show to try and get her to leave. We planned to hang out etc.. after seeing each other at the show! But then she went silent and finally responded saying shes overwhelmed I said completely understand and that when she sorts this out getting her stuff back from current ex we can talk and left it at that but now im very cunfused as i wait for her to reach back out as her moms twlling me she was so happy to see me make her smile and have a good time and even asked if id come work for her occasionally again. I assume to be closer to my ex! Any advice on how to proceed here? I do want to try and rekindle things but dont want what we had but a fresh start with a understanding of what we both expect and how to make it a stronger relationship this time but unsure what in this moment I should do! Wait for her to reach or check in in a few days? Sorry for the life story post lol",

My attorney hasnt been answering my calls or returning calls. I finally spoke to his secretary today after calling and sending emails for a week and a half who said my attorney wont be resetting my court date unless paid in full. I have been making payments per our agreement, but I still owe him 500 and then he will be paid in full. I offered to pay him 300 today and the remainder on the 1st but he refused. I offered the full 500 with a post-dated check but he refused that too. I explained to her since my attorney wont speak to me that I cant come in for my court date because of my work schedule I work as a traveling superintendent. She said that Ill just have to get a bench warrant because my attorney isnt budging. He has done nothing for my case this case has been going on for 2 years now with no end in sight. He hasnt spoken to the DA about getting this case resolved he said at the time he wont handle anything until paid in full. All hes done is reset the case. He wont give me an itemized breakdown of what hes done thus far in regard to the monies hes received. I dont know what to do. If I go to my court date, Ill probably be fired, if I dont go Ill have a bench warrant. Im just flabbergasted with my attorneys actions. I just dont know what to do any advice?",

We were deciding whether we would be in a relationship and were leaning toward not being with each other because we wanted to focus on ourselves. After a few conversations about whether we would be together we said no. Then about a day or two or so later we took that back and made it official, in January Its been a year and a half. I just found out that he lied about the timeline of the hookups he was in the middle of when he met me - One friend of his: a coworker and someone I spent time with during this relationship. I only found out they had ever slept together in the third month, Because she blurted it out while him I were on a phone call with her and her then new boyfriend who he is friends with This was maybe late Nov/Dec He never mentioned this to me, and I asked him about it and he said it was a while ago. It was in October. A few nights before we met. Note: Weve all hung out together, been camping, parties etc. in a group. - When we met there was a girl he was seeing casually, I had seem him talk to her at a party two weeks after we met still so casual at this point, hadnt kissed yet I asked him about it, he said he was talking to her to break this off. This was the end of October I just found out that the last conversation he had with her was in December in November he had seen me one night and later that night had his arm wrapped around her We spoke about this today, He says he hasnt slept with anyone or kissed anyone since meeting me. Note: Sometime last year in Oct or so, The girl asked me when him and I started dating. I said January, which is true That night I asked him about it and he said she was just being weird maybe yes, but I dont really blame her for asking -He told me the last time he spoke to his ex was in December, when dropping off stuff another time telling her about a mutual friends current situation. I found out that he met up with her another time in December he had picked up her calls a few times in January, when we had made it official. Throughout our relationship Ive had doubts about trust and thought they were mainly personal issues Him I have also talked through other things and made progress. There were multiple conversations we had about openness and honesty. After a series of heart to hearts about trust I asked him one last time if there was anything he needed to tell me The things I listed in this post, the things I found out are all things he did not mention Also, he kissed one of his friends whose party we met it and never mentioned it to me it was before we met, even after I asked him to tell me if theres any relationships or interactions hes had w friends that I should be aware of I maybe requested this in late Dec I found that out at the same time as the other stuff I discovered all of this because he gave me one of his devices and messages hadnt synced so the old ones had shown up Yikes right, Phew lol. I spoke to him about this and also talked about the moral dilemma of snooping snooping finding something, so please dont comment about it haha. TLDR: Current partner lied to me about the start of our relationship In all honesty, Im a bit torn Id wrote a short break up note after finding it all out, but I didnt give it to him when we spoke today I am between two thoughts On one hand, I am young. I realize I do not want to be in a relationship founded on dishonesty, because how things start is how they end. I love myself and have been growing into learning trust, so I doubt it would be too hard for me to trust again and I would also give myself a bit of time before entering another relationship. Being single is also beautiful Relationships are weak if they are purely guided by the soft idea of love and No practical guidelines and understandings, no boundaries or self-respect Im a bit worried about the idea of giving myself the chance to be lied to again On the other hand He is a loving person, kind and sweet. I can see the ways hes grown, Ive grown. Weve both pushed each other to become better people In the messages he had with his ex in January, he communicated not wanting to speak anymore. With the girl he last spoke with in December, he cut things off With the friend/coworker he slept with before meeting me, hes distanced himself Though its weird, he is if the belief that he should be kind to others hasnt set strong No contact boundaries with her Note: she cheated on his best friend gave us cookies she made the night she did it When she gave us the cookies she was venting to us about how bad she felt. We found out about this cheating the next day because after she left us she told her ex what she did. I told him I hadnt fully felt comfortable around her and he didnt really do much She reaches out and invites him to all these things, I dont think shes made new friends since she lost the friend group after cheating. I think he feels bad for her. He was going to accept a late birthday gift from her two weeks ago, but set stronger boundaries bc hes still best friends w the ex.. idk if he would do it just bc of me, idk if that matters rn. So I guess thats clear. When we first met, that Oct-Dec period I know we werent so sure if we would become anything. When we started dating in January it was monogamous official I understand being afraid to tell the truth Though I cried for many hours today and last night because of God knows what. Started my period too haha. His behavior was selfish Im not sure when he thought would be the right time to inform me of this THE DILEMMA: I dont thoroughly want to buy into the hate him train What he did sucked, was immature and spineless. I told him about his cowardice. I also deeply value every other part of him. He loves me well, is close with his family and invites me to spend time with them. We get along. He is extremely supportive of my goals and I am of his. Hes seen me through hard times Though some of those hard times were consoling me about my fears of trust, while hiding this from me, but not all haha had been a really good person to have by my side, and Ive been by his. When we started seeing other officially I said yes because I wanted to experience him. As humans experience one another, I dont want to own him or control him or fear him any if that. I want to learn alongside him. Is this part of the learning? What advice do you have? Please dont come from a place of brashness if you do comment, I want genuine perspective. We are only humans, and I can see the growth he had made believe he has the potential to move past this fear, as Ive moved past big fears Though again, we are only humans I only have one life Im young and ambitious. Im not so stuck in believing I am tied to a situation. The decision is ultimately mine, Though I would greatly appreciate the perspective of those of you who are seasoned, kind, wise loving towards yourself and others. I take criticism well. : Thanks so much if you read this far, I appreciate your advice in advance.",

    "title": "Was This Negligence? My Experience with a Nuclear Stress Test Without Clear Explanation",
    "text": "Location: California I went to a cardiologist for chest pain and palpitations. As a younger adult, I understood that some standard testing like blood work, an echocardiogram, a Holter monitor, and a stress test would likely be done. That was completely reasonable and expected. The blood work, echo, and Holter monitor all came back normal. The doctor then ordered a stress test, which I assumed would be the typical treadmill EKG or maybe a stress echo. However, what I wasnt told clearly is that I would be undergoing a nuclear SPECT stress test, involving the injection of a radioactive tracer that exposes the body to a significant level of radiation. The office called me in to sign paperwork before scheduling the test, but no one explained: That this was a nuclear test, That it involved radioactive injection, Or that there were safer and more common alternatives, especially for someone my age and with normal prior results. They only ever referred to it as a stress test, never explained the nature of the test or the risks involved. On the day of the test, I was injected with something described simply as safe, with no explanation of what it actually was. I assumed it was just regular contrast for imaging. It wasnt until afterward that I learned it was radioactive material. They gave me a small water bottle to drink before imaging, but didnt explain that I should be hydrating more afterward to help flush the substance out of my system. The scan results showed a reduced ejection fraction 23 and wall motion abnormalities, which caused me serious distress and anxiety. I left the test feeling worse, worried I had a major heart issue, even though everything else had been normal. The doctor then said he wanted to order a calcium score CT next which was later denied by my insurance as medically unnecessary, something that, in hindsight, isnt surprising given what I now realize about how the situation was handled. Concerned, I sought a second opinion from another cardiologist. He reviewed everything and said he doesnt believe the nuclear test result is accurate. He suggested I only need a repeat echocardiogram and a standard treadmill EKG stress test. He explained that nuclear stress tests can sometimes generate false positives, especially in younger patients or due to artifacts. In his opinion, the test may have been unnecessary and misleading in my case and its not the most reliable option for initial assessment when other results are normal. This raised serious concerns for me: I was not given full information or proper consent. I wasnt told what kind of test I was getting or the associated risks. I was not offered safer alternatives. The test was done in-house, which makes me question whether financial incentives influenced the decision. And worst of all, the test itself may not have even been that accurate it exposed me to radiation and led to an unnecessary scare over potentially false or misleading results. I now believe this test may have been unnecessary and potentially harmful. I trusted that I was receiving the safest and most appropriate care but that trust has been seriously shaken. Shouldnt patients be clearly informed before undergoing such tests, especially when they involve radiation exposure? Given that other cardiologists would likely have chosen safer, less invasive options based on my previous normal results, Im left wondering if this represents a case of negligence or deviation from the standard of care. Was this simply poor communication, or does it cross the line into medical overuse or malpractice? Either way, patients deserve full transparency, informed choice, and safety particularly when tests carry risks and uncertain results. Thank you.",

    "title": "Debt collectors illegally obtained my information. What can I do?",
    "text": "Location: California Last week I received a call from a debt collector stating that I owed my local hospital almost 4,000. I immediately stated that I had already paid my copay, so I would need to speak with my insurance to see if something was wrong. The phone call seemed super sketchy and my scam flags were raised. After the phone call ended, I called the hospital and they confirmed that I did not owe anything. I thought my scam suspicions were confirmed and thought nothing more. However, today I received a letter from the debt collectors with the dates that I was in the hospital from last year. Again, I called my hospital and they said I dont owe anything but they gave me two numbers to call since the hospital contracts their doctors and the x-ray stuff and I might owe them money. After speaking with them, I found out that I owed one of the contracted companies the exact amount that the debt collectors said I owed. Apparently, they didnt have my insurance information and it would be a simple submission of the claim to resolve the payment issue. I asked the company if there was anything they could send their debt collection agency that states that the issue is being resolved and the worker then stated that I havent been sent to collections by them yet. I only received 2 notices and they have a mandatory 5 notice policy before it gets sent to collections. I drove down to the hospital billing department thinking that they must have been the ones to send me to collections then since the hospitals name is who the debt collectors said I owe money to. I tell the billing department what happened, show them the mail I received, and the workers just looked at each other and said look its the same thing as earlier. Someone had just left and they had the exact same issue as me. The worker told me that they dont even use the debt collection agency that was contacting me and that I should call the contracted company again to see what debt collection agency they use. Unsurprisingly, contracted company does not use the debt collection agency that contacted me either. Since neither place has sent me to collections, it has to mean that this debt collection agency obtained my information illegally, right? Would this be along the lines of a data breach, and if so, what actions should be taken legally? Is this more serious since it involves my medical information? Thank you!!",

I still love him very much, but I have started to develop feelings for my friend. Back in March I reconnected with someone I knew back in high school and I learned that we are both trans women and share some hobbies. Since then weve been hanging out every other weekend. While we mostly just play video games or board games, we have had personal conversations. Through these personal conversations Ive learned how supportive, confident and passionate she is. I havent said anything to either of them, because Im afraid how theyll both react. I want to stay friends with her, but I also dont want to hurt my boyfriend. I dont know what to do and its eating me up inside. Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation and if you have what did you do?",

    "text": "I 23M got broken up with by my ex 23F about a month ago after a three year relationship. We were each others first partners and I was certain I was going to spend the rest of my life with this person. The break up was amicable, and she offered to be friends, but I decided to initiate no contact instead. I havent heard from her since. We agreed during the break up to meet a week later, but when the day came she never contacted me I didnt reach out either in all fairness, but i thought it was best not to encroach on her space. In the next week, its almost guaranteed were going to see each other as I have to be in a place I know shes at a lot. I have no idea how to handle it. Firstly, Im worried seeing her is going to shatter me. Ive kept myself together fairly well since the break up id say, but im very much still in love with her. Im still in a stage where im just taking each day at a time. Ive been focusing on trying to move on, but I feel like seeing her could just unravel all that progress and bring out all the emotions I feel about her. Secondly, I want to show her Im doing well. I truthfully would like nothing more than to get her back and whilst I cant control that, I at least want to show my best side when I see her. I dont want our interaction to be awkward, I want to be come across as confident and doing well. I have no idea how to handle this kind of situation as Ive never gone through it before. If i see her should I talk to her or just leave it? Should I keep the conversation light or bring up the break up? Should I try rekindle a connection with her or keep it professional? How do I handle my feelings that I still have for her? I have so many questions that I dont know how to answer, so any advice would be really helpful.",

    "text": "Hello, I, 21F, am very stuck and confused regarding relationships in general. I have had two relationships in my life. The first, I am not going to focus on much since it happened when I was struggling with some mental health things, and it also had a list of issues that I have come to terms with. My second relationship is when things start to get confusing for me. I dated my best friend, 21F, we will call her E for this story. Our relationship was amazing, since we were best friends before, it was already built on a lot of trust and understanding. We were very comfortable and communicative, and everything was great! For some additional context, I am sort of going through a battle with asexuality, as I dont fully know if I am interested in that form of intimacy or not. I was open about this, and E understood and respected that completely. The issue started as things got more serious, as I was interested in trying more intimate things, but would then get very anxious at the idea. It was very confusing, as I would want something one minute, then freak out about it the next. This anxiety began to take over my mind a bit, and it spread to other parts of our relationship. It got to the point where I stared to get anxious about any physical contact. I was pulling away, which I still feel terrible about. It got to a point where we were acting like just friends again, and her and I agreed that our feelings had shifted back to being more platonic. E and I are still best friends, and funnily enough, will cuddle and kiss mostly when.. inebriated, just because we feel comfortable with each other. Its so odd because I feel almost more comfortable doing those things now as friends than I did as girlfriends. Another thing I have been struggling with is dating/dating apps. I will find people who I genuinely like, or am attracted to/interested in, but once it gets serious like meeting up for the first time or something I completely draw back. I dont think Im aromantic, I have the desire to be in a relationship. I want to have a partner and go on dates and do romantic relationship things. I just dont know what is stopping me. Obviously my anxiety, but why does that only happen when my relationship is defined as romantic and begins to get more serious? Am I secretly just aromatic and in denial? TLDR: Anytime a romantic relationship turns serious, I get anxious and pull back, and I dont know what is causing that anxiety.",

    "text": "She gave my phone number to her coworker so I could deliver him herbs, allegedly. Ive been passing by his place doing deliveries for months, allegedly, and I havent heard from her since. She hmu three times before then, for herbs, and we would talk in the car. We used to be coworkers so it was cool to catch up years later. We have a lot in common and I wish we could talk more. I hadnt seen her in months and I felt weird thinking about her often so I gave up on the thought of us being closer. Her friend hmu to deliver to a bar the other night. I had talked to him some of the times I had seen him and he seemed nice and into video games but I didnt have a total feel for his vibe talking thru the car window. He came up to my window with her and we talked about how she heard my job might be closing thru our mutual friend. She said a few nice things to me that made me feel good and I hope we signs she likes me, or at least would want to be closer. She mentioned how we werent hyper-close but she cared about me and wouldnt want the business to close where we both used to work. She said I was a sweetheart, which could mean nothing. Before I arrived they had been talking trying to guess what my zodiac sign was, could be something. I told her my sign and when I was born and we talked some about that and other interests. I had mentioned I regret being too shy to talk to her because she is so cool when we were coworkers and I mentioned I was kind of shy to talk to all of my former coworkers there because everyone seemed very cool to me, and she said I was the coolest person there back then which could just be her keeping conversation rolling. She described me as reliable and organized because of the way I work, I guess. We had been talking thru the window and I offered to smoke with them and they invited me to the bar outside and I joined. We all chilled for like 45 minutes to an hour and she left, it was late and she had some to drink. I ended up chilling with her friend and other coworkers for another hour or so and I think they liked me. I got to know the guy I deliver to more and he is actually pretty cool and showed me some cool video game stuff. I guess what Im worried about is that I mean nothing to her and we have never texted about anything other than me delivering herbs or like 5 years ago I covered her shift. We also have mutual friends, one of whom is a friend of mine I care about. I wouldnt want to pursue her if she was not interested, especially because it could make me look like a grimy guy. I dont have any dating apps and I havent pursued anyone too seriously since my last relationship because it was traumatic and I like to see one person. She is the only person Im interested in and I wouldnt mind just being friends with her. I thought about texting her about something casual like if she plays Pokémon Go, me and her friend added each other after she left or ask her a question about an old game she mentioned while we were talking. I really dont want to annoy her with stupid questions though, I really respect her to the point I have almost been afraid of her for so long. Talking to her the other nice was really nice because I felt more connected for once. She is also really beautiful and Im alright looking but I think Im unique looking and I have a lot of good qualities that make me extend the belief that she could like me, but I would totally understand if she would be interested in a different type of guy and just sees me as a cool friend of hers.",

    "text": "Ive never posted to reddit before, Ive only ever used it as a resource to read advice from others, but Im now thinking its time I post about my situation and hopefully gain some outside perspective here because I am spiraling trying to figure out what to do with my relationship. Ive 26F been dating this guy 24M for almost 6 months now that I met on a dating app. We clicked instantly and basically havent gone a single day without talking since our first date. We went exclusive on our third date, and thats where weve been since. He hasnt asked me to make it official yet, but Ill get into that later. The kicker: I told him right from our first date that I would be moving abroad for 3 months, 3 months after we met. Once we actually started to date each other more, we had some conversations about it and agreed that we would continue dating and stay together during this time, and that he would even come to visit me. 3 months of dating where we live, 1 month of long distance, 2 weeks back together where I live abroad, another month of long distance 5 weeks to be exact so a little over it, and then I would be back in our city for the foreseeable future. Not so bad, so we thought. The first three months together in our city were pretty great, we had a few minor hiccups in the last month hes definitely a bit of an avoidant so any hiccups consisted of him needing a little space for a day or a weekend but nothing crazy, but nothing of concern at all. Then, the first month of long distance was ROUGH. For context, where I am living we have a 6-hour time zone difference between us. During that one month of LDR, he was traveling a bit himself, and we felt rather disconnected from each other. It was harder to make phone calls and keep consistent communication. We did have a conversation one night where I broke down about it, and the conversation went fairly well and we made a lot of improvements in our communication after that. All was really well until he came to visit me. He flew to see me and spend nearly two weeks with me in my city, and almost right from day one, we bickered. I cant even tell you over what anymore, but we just did not stop bickering. During these two weeks, he was on vacation completely not working at all and I worked one week I work from home though and the second week I took off to spend time together. I will mention, he is an extremely routine-oriented person. Him not working, not having time to go to the gym etc, was definitely a big factor in throwing things off. He gets fairly cranky and irritable when hes not able to do his routine things, especially the gym. Regardless, everyday we bickered about something ridiculous. It started to make me feel like shit. I would ask a question or say something that would tick him off, something that I thought was a completely reasonable and normal remark, and he would respond in a very judgmental, condescending tone. Im not saying im a perfect angel, I know that I may have said some stupid stuff also, but I really dont think anything Ive said warranted the tone Id get from him. Dont get me wrong, we also did have an amazing time together on our trip, it wasnt just ALL bad stuff. We laughed, we connected, we had great sex, all the good things, but so much of the constant bickering overshadowed that. We ended up also having a much deeper conversation one night because he still hasnt asked me to be his girlfriend, and he expressed to me how he hasnt felt ready because our relationship has been inconsistent with me moving and leaving. He said that the first three months of us dating, we always had this thing looming over our heads, aka the fact that I was going to be leaving for three months. Then I left, and the one month of long distance was very difficult. Then he comes to visit, and we are bickering all the time. He said he just doesnt think we are there yet and we still have more to figure out, and for me to get back to our city in a month and just enjoy the relationship normally. I was upset, but I could also see his perspective, so I agreed but said I would just need a little extra reassurance from him that he still wants to be with me while we are working these kinks out. That conversation ended great. Now, he left a week ago from visiting me, and we didnt leave it on a good note nor a bad one, just kind of in the middle. The first day after he left we texted, but then the rest of the week, our communication has absolutely sucked. No phone calls, but I assumed thats because he started a new 9-6 job, in office everyday M-F. With the time zone difference, when he leaves work, Im in bed. But regardless, the texting has barely been a message per day. It got to the point where I havent been responding for hours out of pure anxiety. Im feeling extremely disconnected, and I think he is also, and Im just scared and lost. I really like this guy and I can see a future with him, but I think the two weeks of being with each other non stop, up each others skin took a tole on what was already a bit of a rocky surface. I cant tell yet if this is just who he is, or if its just strain caused by distance. I feel so left out in the cold and not sure of what to do next. Ive thought of every single possibility in my head. Breaking it off? staying together? etc. My goal would be for us to stay together and have a productive conversation over the phone about the disconnect, but I dont even know what I would say. Im still abroad for another 4 weeks before I am home and I see him, so I feel conflicted. Im scared and I dont want this to end. Please send help lol.",

    "text": "I 28M and my wife 29F have a 6-month-old baby. I come from a Muslim background, and my wife is from a Western culture. She converted for me so that our marriage would be easier in regard to my parents and their beliefs. My wife is from Austria, and Im from Denmark. She moved to Denmark for me while we were dating. Since my wife got pregnant, she has been telling me that she doesnt want anyone to hold our son. In the beginning, I was against it, as I wanted my parents to hold him, but in the end, I agreed with her. She said that once our son can say yes or no for himself, only then will she allow others to hold him. This has caused a lot of trouble between my parents and me. During my paternity leave, she and I went to her mother in Austria with our son, who was 2 months old at the time. Of course, she let her mom hold him. I said I was okay with it, because I dont mind people holding our son. She claims it was hard for her at first to let her mom hold him, but after a few weeks, I could see how strong the bond between them became. Skipping ahead to now our son is 6 months old, and my parents still havent had any chance to bond with him. Every time I mention visiting them, she asks if anyone is sick, and then adds, They do know they cant hold him, right? She claims she wants to be there a few times before letting them hold him, but honestly, I dont believe that anymore. Is this normal behavior from my wife? Is there anything I can do? Any advice is appreciated.",

I dont really know these guys that I talked to. A few of my friends have said to lie as they can take half of my house but how if were not married? Can they really take half of my house after 6 months of dating? I have asked around but they all say no they cant. So is it bad that I lie?

I have simply stopped talking to him completely and even when he is kind to me I know its fake and I despise him for it. I love my mum so much, she is the only person I trust and seeing as I dont have any friends I guess my only friend too, I think they have always viewed me as disappointing which is fair and they were both devastated when a couple years ago I was regularly sh. Now, there is no concern and the only way they talk to me is to just get through as we all have to live together, when I cry my mum just leaves it alone when I sit in front of here and tell her if he doesnt leave I will, she says nothing. She now calls the hate for my father irrational and tells me to get over myself she never acted like this before and her whole mood and tone towards me has changed. It is no longer that of a caring mother but someone who is sick and tired of me. I want to leave and I hate myself, I dont know if I can fix it.",

    "title": "How do I fix the behaviors my partner doesnt like about me if he cant give me an example of what Im doing? 40f,39m tl:dr at bottom",
    "text": "My partner 39m and myself 40f keep having a similar issue with our communication style and I could use some advice from reddit. A little backstory because people may ask - Weve been together for 10 years. We arent married because I have a chunk of student loan debt left from a stupid degree from before we met and Id rather have that finished before we get married, 4yrs left on the loan still. The issue - weve been talking about love languages and his are physical touch and quality time, and I try my best to show him these love styles. My love languages are acts of service and words of affirmation. He is great with acts of service but his affirmation/validation is always just about my appearance, he struggles with deeper affirmations. I asked him to google words of affirmation in December but I havent heard many if any affirmations since then, aside from a few about how I look nice today. I brought up words of affirmation today during a communication exercise our therapist had us working on: I feel ____ about/because______ and I need you to ______. He said that he googled words of affirmation a month ago and it didnt work and that I dismissed everything he said as stupid. I dont remember saying anything was stupid. Thats not a word I use because I dont really believe in stupid. I also dont recall any affirmations. I asked if he had an example of what affirmation he said he didnt remember what affirmation he said. I asked if he had an example of what I said that was dismissive and he said he didnt need an example and that I need to trust him that I made him feel that way. I do trust that I made him feel that way but he didnt tell me in the moment what I did to make him feel that way and then when we brought it up weeks later he said he had no examples, so I dont know how to avoid making him feel that way in the future. this is my brick wall - how do I change the way Im coming across if he doesnt tell me in the moment when I do/say something or then when we talk about it later, he has no examples of my negative behavior. I have asked him countless times to please tell me in the moment or have an example so I have something constructive I can work on. I dont think its fair to me to be upset with me and not tell me in the moment or have any examples. Maybe Im too stuck on the examples? But without examples, Im stuck analyzing all my behavior from the last month, and without examples Im nervous that Im doing something now that in a month he will say was me being some type of way. How am I supposed to fix something if I dont know what it is? TL/DR: Most fights are my partner being mad, annoyed, upset, etc with me and not telling me in the moment. Then sitting on the mad, annoyed, upset, some type of way for days or weeks and when I ask for an example of what I did, he says that he doesnt have an example and I need to trust him that I did it. How do I fix something when my partner doesnt have any examples of what I did? Am I too hung up on examples?",

    "title": "I 39m am reconsidering a relationship with gf 38f. Is this salvageable?",
    "text": "I have 2 sons from a past relationship that ended 4 years ago. Dont want to get into too much details but we grew apart and maybe were never really compatible, except for parenting. She left me because of a mix of not enough common interests, lack of intimacy and a trip with her high school bf during which she cheated. 3 years ago I met my current gf. Everything was great at the beginning. 6 months in I kinda discovered that she has trouble regulating emotions. She is quite sensitive and will take a long time to come back from a fight or a comment. Im quite talkative and like to make jokes so I constantly have to walk on eggshells to keep myself from saying things that could offend her. The relationship is actually pretty good. We both have our houses and the kids she has one get along pretty well. Ive met her family and friends and like them and vice versa. The thing is I still want to leave this relationship but feel like an asshole for doing so. She has not cheated and has not ever said anything mean to me and she loves me. The thing that has me reconsidering the relationship is really about emotion regulation. For example, her parents will give her a piece of land. We had planned on getting a small camp built on it. I asked if I could buy half the land from her so that I can feel at home and she refused, saying that she wants to keep that land in her family, which I totally understand. I then asked her if shed be fine with me buying a piece of land as an investment and leave it for my boys when I die. She disconnected and was frustrated that I made things so complicated and she would have liked to keep things simple for once her words. I feel like its ok for her to be disappointed but the disappointment lasted for 24 hours. When she is disappointed she will be very hard to talk to and will disconnect from me. Same situation happened when I talked to her about a trip I wanted to have. I invited her and her son to come on a trip with me and the boys during the summer but said she preferred not to take a trip like that in the summer so she can visit friends and family. I still wanted to do that trip so I kept planning it. She was disappointed that I went on with it and that was a hot topic for like 2 months, during which every time we talked about that trip, the night was over, she would disconnect. These are just two examples but I could go on. This has taken its toll on me and now I dont want to risk this anymore. Like things will be perfect for a week, Ill gain confidence and then out of the blue a situation will arise out of nowhere and Ill have to cope with it. My love is dying from a thousand small cuts. I dont want to feel like I failed again. I dont want to risk finishing my life alone. I love that person. But I also dont want to live in uncertainty for the rest of my life. Id love to get advice from people who felt similar things. I talked to her about this in the past. I asked if we could go to therapy but she didnt want to do that. She acknowledged that she has trouble talking about her emotions and that it is the way she has been brought up. For some kind of reasons I also think I might be the problem and wonder what I could do differently.",

    "title": "Is my boyfriend losing interest or just too comfortable?",
    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 2 years. Weve had recurring issues, especially around boundaries, like him staying in daily contact with his ex until I eventually gave an ultimatum. Whenever I bring up problems, he gets defensive and sees it as a personal attack, which makes honest conversations really difficult. Lately, Ive been feeling like hes either gotten too comfortable or is slowly losing interest. Last week, he chose to stay out late with friends rather than have dinner with me like wed planned. He doesnt usually spend much time with his friends, so although hurt, I tried to be understanding. But it did end up turning into an argument, and I called him out on his general lack of effort. His idea of spending time together is usually just inviting me over for dinner that we make together, but only after asking for a lift somewhere or to help him run errands. Every hang out is tied to a favour. He never initiates proper plans. The last few times weve seen each other, hes gone out of his way to talk about plans with his friends and made a point of making it clear Im not invited, which I dont mind, but I just dont understand why hes got to make a big show out of having these plans without me. He also randomly brought up a girl he used to work with and how her new boyfriend apparently looks exactly like him, and how she apparently is always asking their mutual friend how he is doing. It felt unnecessary and a bit weird to mention. It seemed like he was reflecting on the relationship, questioning how much of his life has started to revolve around it, and expressing some doubts about whether our paths still align especially with me returning to university soon after being home for the summer. It was difficult to read, and I havent mentioned it to him because I dont think he ever intended me to see it. Despite this, he still makes effort to text everyday, joked about me moving in with him over the summer and weve just booked a holiday with my family. He was also very affectionate when we last saw each other. So Im stuck and I dont understand where I stand with him. I dont really want to confess to seeing the note, because I get the impression it was more a confused vent that he never intended for me to see. I would really appreciate advice. I feel stuck between wanting to fix things and wondering if I should just be cutting my loses at this point?",

    "text": "So we dated 2 years ago and while dating I was very in love with him and put eggort into our relationship. When we had agreed to be exclusive with each other and get off the apps, I found out sometime later that he was still on them. I brought it up and he said hed delete them. Fast forward i find out he never followed through and was still on them. Unfortunately for my self respect this turned into a back and forth of me asking him to delete him saying he did or he would and me finding out he lied. He would make excuses like he was on the apps because he liked messing with people. Stupid stuff. He eventually became very unkind and would get upset with me about tiny little things. He called me out of the blue thinking he had an std and was essentially blaming me. I got tested and so did he. I got my results and told him I was clean and as soon as I said I was, he claimed to have called his doctor and the receptionist gave him the results over the phone, which I know isnt true. After all this and him telling me things like i mean nothing compared to his exes, I went zero contact. I found out from other women later he was setting up and going on dates and he had one date planned and had to cancel on them because we went to a movie that night. I just felt so gross and disgusted at that point and my genuine love for him turned into genuine hate. That was over 2 years ago. Recently he reached out by email, and I caved and went and let him take me out and actually treat me well for a change. And he claims he went to therapy and is different and that he knows he screwed up and that he should have done things a certain way and thats how he wants to do things now. He said he felt like he was good-looking for the first time in his life and that he enjoyed all the attention he was getting. But that it felt like pulling teeth with everyone else he was with after me. That when he really wanted it to work with someone and put in the effort they would treat him how he felt he treated me and claims he finally realized how he made me feel after that. Im pretty sour still, and I also feel like hes slithering back to me as a last resort after going through all his options. But im not really good at these things. I often make the wrong decisions and I need some guidance on how I should handle this. Im just not sure how much I can believe after being lied to so much before. What would you guys do? Is it worth exploring or am I wasting my time and setting myself up for pain again?",

    "title": "My closest friend of over 27 years has begun to treat me poorly.",
    "text": "Over the past few weeks, my closest and most trusted friend has begun treating me disrespectfully. For over 27 years, we have had or I thought we had a very strong, healthy friendship. I have disclosed personal trauma with her that I would never be comfortable discussing with anyone else, and I have never had a bad thing to say about her. The disrespect originally began a few weeks ago with belittling comments and constantly rolling her eyes when I would speak. It truly took me back as we do not treat each other like this at all. I did not say anything as I am very non confrontational and quite sensitive, whereas she is very bold and loves to be confrontational but it usually was never towards me. As time has gone on, she has gotten physical. Often pushing and shoving me but not in a joking way. I have not stood up for myself yet as it has honestly just broken my heart. I have been crying often but have now decided if she gets physical again I will stand up for myself and tell her thats not okay. The last time she pushed me was 2 days ago. Furthermore, the belittling comments have only worsened. If I say anything, she will ignore me or respond in a way of making fun of me. Moreover, she began deliberately excluding me. For example, the other day we were at a restaurant with a group of 6, she, leading the group, selected a table for 5 and I was the last one in line so was unfortunately the one left behind but this was purposeful. Luckily another person in the group felt bad for me and came to sit with me. After she pushes me or makes fun of me, I get very quiet and clam up, and then, she will ask whats wrong? to which I typically respond Im just feeling overwhelmed with work because, as previously stated, I have always struggled with confrontation. I just never thought our friendship would turn into this, and I cannot explain the hurt I am feeling, as this is the person I have confided in throughout the most difficult times of my life and same for her. It seems that woke up one day and decided to hate me. What I am is asking is, is this friendship worth salvaging or does this look like something I just need to accept heartbreak and walk away from after 27 years?",

She is 62 with a gorgeous body and tells me shes pretty mobile but has sore joints and struggles to hold herself up during sex. Weve tried everything that doesnt involve my movement cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, doggystyle, hell even the Amazon position and nothing is enough to get me off.

    "text": "Hi Reddit, Im 18F and I could really use some advice. Theres a guy, Ryan 19M, who apparently used to like me but I didnt know at the time. My friend Emily 18F fell in love with him, and they dated for a while. They seemed really into each other at first, but things got weird. Ryan started calling her uncomfortable nicknames like cute little puppy and other cringey stuff that made her feel gross. She broke up with him, and he responded with, I never liked you anyway. Fast forward to a week ago: in class, Ryan quietly asked me for my number. I was caught off guard and just said maybe because I didnt know what to do. Later, I told my best friend Sophie 18F not Emily, and she admitted that about a month ago, Ryan asked her what my favorite color is. She thought it was weird and didnt mention it until now. Heres the thing: I dont like him. At all. I dont find him attractive sorry and Im not into his personality either. I just feel really uncomfortable and confused. Is he trying to flirt with me? Is he using me to get back at Emily? Or is this just some random creepy behavior? I dont want to overreact, but I also dont want to ignore this weird gut feeling. Any advice would be appreciated!",

Normally I drive things with sex and were both extremely happy, but when she tries to have sex with me instead of the other way around, she cant make me cum. She is 62 with a gorgeous body and tells me shes pretty mobile but has sore joints and struggles to hold herself up during sex. Weve tried everything that doesnt involve my movement cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, doggystyle, hell even the Amazon position and nothing is enough to get me off. I have no problem leading sex the rest of our lives together because shes absolutely beautiful but it makes her extremely self conscious and embarrassed and I hate to see her like that.

    "title": "28F Cheated on my 27M husband and not sure where to pick up the pieces",
    "text": "I 28F asked my 27M husband for a temporary separation. Im not sure what Im hoping to expect from it. Weve been together for 12 years dated at 16 married at 18. We have 4-year-old twins on the spectrum. I work full time and my husband is primarily a stay at home dad he works 2-3 days on occasion. If this sounds familiar, its because it is. My husband made and deleted his own post on here yesterday looking for his own set of his. It was a bit difficult to digest his simplified take on things, so Ive decided to make my own post with additional details. Ill discuss items in chronological order, that have led me to my decision of a temporary separation. Honestly, Im fucked up. I dont know how to deal with problems, and I swallow things down. I probably needed therapy as a child but my parents werent the kind that were open to stuff like that. I was molested from when I was 6-10 by a family friend. I was sexually assaulted again when I was 15 at school by a guy. My mom spent a decade convincing me my dad hates through underhanded comments. I was genuinely terrified of speaking to my father and this really hurt my self esteem. My mom always yelled, belittled, and expected a lot from me example - I was made to be almost like a third parent to my younger brother. My mom has untreated bipolar disorder and always minimized my pain and problems - I vividly recall having a panic attack in my room and her barging in to shake me physically and yell at me to get over it. When I told her one day about being molested as a child, she just shrugged it off and admitted she thought something was off. Anyways, I had a toxic home. I felt like my parents didnt offer me support. So I started working at 17. When I hit 18, my mom called me a whore because I asked to extend my 8pm curfew to 10ish to visit my husband then boyfriend and denied my request. This made me breakdown tbh and was the last straw I ran away that same day and moved into my husbands home with his parents. My husband and proposed and boom I was married at 18. We did move out on our own a bit before that. I loved my husband and was overjoyed at our marriage. However, our relationship was toxic. He was deeply insecure and actively pushed EVERYONE away from his life and expected the same from me, which I did. I pushed my friends away and dropped all my guy friends. I had anger issues and that often manifested in yelling and occasionally physically hitting him. Eventually we mellowed out and slowly over time but we were isolated. We struggled with money too, often living month to month. In the end, I made up with my parents and a few years later we moved in with them to finish college. We were about 23 then things were still tense. My husband doesnt like my parents and vice versa. Hes even made comments about how my parents could live on the street before living with us this hurt to hear tbh because my dad and I have since squashed our misunderstanding from my childhood and hes been incredibly supportive of us while stil having his issues with liking my husband. I got pregnant. My husband jumped to suggesting abortion. Which hurt. It was covid, we were 23, had no jobs, living at my parents. It made sense, but it hurt. I ended keeping the babies and he developed severe anxiety. He wasnt present at the ultrasounds. I always got bad news, had a short cervix with the twins that led to PPROM, premature birth. I was on bed rest like 3 months and hospitalized for nearly 2. This was a very traumatic time for me and my husband wasnt emotionally or mentally present to help me. I was told I could my babies could die often. My appointments were never good, I cried at nearly every appointment. We, me and his mom had to convince him to stay at the hospital with me during my stay and he didnt attend the C-section. Id never felt so alone before and thats when I fell out of love tbh. I had postpartum depression and had to stop being a SAHM. I got a job instead and he too on being the primary caretaker, I also made double when he did starting. Hes an excellent father btw. He adores our boys and Im incredibly fortunate to have him. Over the next few years I busted my ass working to get promoted, I was promoted every year at job which is difficult. I went for 45k to 90k in 3 years. I was often stresses, did OT, and studied for work licenses. I took care of the kids most weekends and couldnt handle it which made me like a horrible mother. The boys are autistic and like routine their father, so when he worked it was hard to keep them happy. The little free time I had was always spent on my husband he has no friends and not close to family, I carried his everything socially. I couldnt exist in a different from from him and I felt suffocated. I began to think back and realize how toxic our situation had been and reconnected more and more with my friends. Regardless my depression grew, I felt and still feel like I had no autonomy in our marriage. My wants had to be negotiated, defended, and justified to him like hanging out with friends over the weekend. It drove me insane because everything was about US. There was no me. Like I had to ask him for permission for everything. He noticed my depression and made me feel bad about my lack of interest in things so I started hiding in my office. I started sleeping in my office. I became suicidal for a bit and felt like I couldnt even kill myself because he and the kids depended on me. I shouldve pursued help but I didnt. Im not longer suicidal but I did keep sleeping apart and its been two years. We dont kiss, we dont have sex, and we hadnt since we basically had the boys 4 years ago. Our marriage was deeply damanged and I wasnt in love with him. I asked for a divorce a year ago but it took it back because he mentioned hed live in a less than secure area with the boys because itd be all he can afford even with child support and alimony. That scared me. I felt stuck. I feel alone. I had an affair. I met someone online who made me feel seen, who heard and validated my pain, who listened to most of this and didnt make me feel insane. This man wasnt just some online sexual outlet - he was my best friend and I fell in love, as silly as that sounds. It was wrong, he was married. I was married. I dont condone it and Im not proud either. After things ended, I admitted all of it to my husband an pursued a divorce. I cant afford a lawyer since I pay the bills and my husband was quick to point out his family would pay for his. We got into arguments, I was scared, I took it back. I genuinely want to keep our family together and keep my husband in my life. But I cant get those feelings of love back. My husband has made me feel small over the years without realizing it and Ive felt trapped because I need to provide everyone knows about the affair now too and Im mortified when interacting with friends and family. My actions have affected me, my family, my affair partner, his family, our children... And I feel horrible. I recently found our they are headed towards divorce and I feel responsible. Its been eating me up alive that I let myself become someone who would lie, cheat, and hurt others. I needed help before, I needed out. So now here I am asking him for a temporary situation while I figure my shir out and make sense of ME. He doesnt like it. I get that. I dont feel like Im in love with my husband and havent been for years. Hes still my best friend and I desperately want him in my life. Am I unreasonable for asking for a separation to sort me out? Is this relationship just too damaged to salvage? I worry divorce is our only way forward and I hoped seperarion would convince me otherwise idk. Sorry for the wall of text but thanks for reading. His post yesterday and the comments really affected me.",

    "text": "I cant upload images here so I can upload my diary entry with all of the context I posted the entries on another subreddit if you want to see it on my profile, but heres the gist of it: Im a highschooler and the president of a club. Last year, our club sponsor told us the board officers that we had 2000 dollars in the club account. The problem is that when we brought up the 2000 dollars this year in a situation where we needed just a bit of money from it, he acted like it didnt exist, then when acted like it was spent on a mural project the club was going which was paid for by the school, then claimed that we didnt pay for the mural after we kept asking why we paid for a school sponsored mural, then claiming he didnt have access to the club bank account, to saying hell print the audits for the account.... The money in this account that I dont know the existence of anymore was made by members throughout the years and is supposed to be used to improve the quality of the club. Every time we bring up money to pay for something, he acts like its a huge pain to get to it and he always ends up paying for stuff out of pocket because according to him the finance handler of our school is incompetent and cant process things in time. Im thinking of reporting this to the principal but Im about to graduate and dont know what kind of trouble Im going to get into if this escalates. I dont know what to do because I have absolutely no solid evidence of anything other than this extremely suspicious conversation I had with him but if I dont do anything the club is going to be driven to the floor hell get away with stealing money from a high school club that worked very hard for it. And what if hes innocent? Then I might be screwing over his career at this school...",

    "title": "My father hates my 20F boyfriend 20M boyfriend purely because of his weight. How am I supposed to move forward with my relationship and manage family pressure?",
    "text": "I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year. He is overweight for context about 185cm/61 and weighs about 135kg/298 lbs. We recently moved in together and it was a huge deal for my parents. I knew before that they do not approve of him, so I didnt even ask of their opinion before moving in, I just stated that we are moving in. We are students and we just moved into a dormitory in which we could live together and not with random people, so it really isnt that big of a deal. Moving on to my family, weve always had a close relationship, of course in my teen years there would be some bickering but nothing abnormal. However, my father has always been a raging person who cannot control his emotions, so it was no wonder that when I told him that I moved in with my boyfriend, he screamed at me for a literal hour. He told me that this was the biggest tragedy of his life and that he would rather me date a black person than a fat person hes extremely racist, sexist, you name it, I dont know if it makes a difference but for context we live in an ex-soviet country, not USA, he told me many many horrible things, he begged me to not move in with him, told me that it will be a nightmare come true if I come home with a ring one day. And last but not least, that the children we would have would be degenerates. Out of all horrible things he has said to men throughout my 20 years of life he has said a lot, this probably hurt me the most. It is important to mention that my boyfriend and I go to the gym, in the mornings we go on a run sometimes, we do cardio and we have a very good diet. And I myself notice slow but steady progress and believe in him that he can become healthier. I wouldnt be with him if he didnt attempt to become the best version of himself because thats what Im doing as well and thats the kind of life we want. He hates my boyfriend only because of his appearance, well to be honest, my parents dont personally know my boyfriend very well, they have met my boyfriend only a few times, because I dont really invite my boyfriend over at my parents house. The reason for that is I was afraid of my parents judgement because I knew their viewpoint on overweight people. So I just avoided this. Maybe in a way, that was the culprit of all of this, since they never really got to know the real him, the him I fell in love. He treats me perfectly, I feel over the moon whenever I am with him and we both have the same goals. If soulmates exist, he is mine. So it is feels really troubling. All this has been going on since last summer, since we also got in a fight for a very very stupid reason, but then they told me their real feelings about my boyfriend. Ever since, my father has been dropping hints that I should find someone else, and whenever he catches me in a sadder mood, he always blames my boyfriend for it, when its not even the case. All of this only because I chose to love someone. As I am only 20 years old, and am a student living two hours away from my hometown every 2 weeks I come home to my parents but every time I come home, I regret it, I dont even feel good here anymore, but if I dont come home for like a month, my mom texts me, kind of manipulates me into coming home, because if I dont come home, I dont really love my family. I respect them for everything they have done to me, but they do not understand that they are pushing me away and also growing hatred inside me towards them. When talking to my friend about this, she suggested me to make a dinner and invite my boyfriend so we could all have a dinner and get to know each other. And it probably would be the best idea in this scenario, but I feel like throwing up even thinking about this idea. I really feel like sinking into the ground rather than having dinner with my parents and with my boyfriend. How can I balance staying true to my relationship and values while managing the emotional pressure and manipulation from my family? Ironically enough, Fathers day is coming up and Im very much so not feeling it coming home to congratulate him, but I know I will still do so, no matter how it makes me feel.",

People actually want to give solid advice, but it would be best if it wont be a struggle, A few spaces here and there even if the thoughts are not or are wonky, It helps us the readers understand all the information youll be dumping/sharing which would help us collect ourselves, relate and share solid advices. Although you are in a tough position, youll get more engagement, this is the least, I or we could ask. Do you like reading lengthy history textbooks? Hope this is incorporated, its much appreciated and helps aid the cause towards our betterment as a community and as individuals.",

    "text": "Location: Alabama My husbands ex killed 2 people while she was driving under the influence at over 100mph. She has a fairly lengthy drug criminal history in our small Alabama town and when she finally went to court her lawyer advised her that if she didnt accept a plea deal for 15 years she would most likely end up with two life sentences so she took the deal for a 15 year straight sentence with no parole. Now shes serving her time at the womens prison here in Alabama but has been telling their children that shes going to get into a program that will help her come home in 3-5 years. My question is with the fact that she signed a plea deal for 15 straight years with no parole we saw the paperwork for the deal is there a way for her to not have to serve the whole time? I was trying to make this as to the point as possible so if there are any clarifying questions please feel free to ask. Thanks in advance for any answers I may receive.",

Planned date nights and things were going well. Until they werent I found out he was planning a vacation with his best friend for June. He also put in zero effort while im our trying phase so I confronted him and said I think you were right. You dont have it in you to get back to a good place. I hired movers and left. This was about a week ago that I moved out. It sucks its tough. But what sucks more is NOW he is like wait you are the one I want what was I thinking I fucked up. And im sitting here like it took me to hire MOVERS for you to say this? I believe thats what hes feeling now that im gone but I dont think its the overall truth. He wouldve known like I did that it was worth it before I literally left the house and our 3 year old dog. It almost hurts more. And what sucks is I so badly want to be like yes lets do it ill come back but for what. I wasnt loved back.",

    "text": "Location: Manchester, UK Im looking to buy a flat in Manchester city centre, UK, and a post came up on my Facebook feed advertising a flat for 500 in Salford which I thought was quite surprising so I messaged the poster and asked for a viewing. She said she had previously rented the room and sent me the email of the owner, I sent her an email where she provided me more photos of the flat and explained her life story a bit which I thought was a bit weird. I asked about the price of bills and council tax with no reply, the only reply I got was that she handles her rent through VRBO and that I would have to send them money so that she can register the flat and enable the listing. Its only then that once I send the money I can view the flat which I thought was a bit sketchy, I had never heard of this before. Later in the email she says if I agree to sign the contract then the payment would be forwarded to her which makes me think she wants 500 up front before even viewing the property. She did mention in the email that if I choose not to proceed then a refund is guaranteed but who knows how true that is. Thank you in advance for the advice Some added information, I just searched the flat online and the building is in Affinity Living which via their website seems to go for 1300 per month for a similar room, can I be safe to say this is a scam?",

    "text": "I have been in a relationship with my bf for about a year and a half now. Recently, i discovered he was making highly sexual comments on reddit pornstuff like complimenting their bodies, penis, saying theyre his dream guys, he wants to be their husband. I confronted him, and he explained that it was just for Reddit Karma as he was trying to grow attraction. After that, i told him to stop commenting but could still continue to use the internet. We talked for a while, he seemed very apologetic and sincere. For context, he always talks about his sexuality being weird at times and that there is always something he is interested in sexually. While also noting that we have great sex and he is very full-filed. The next morning after i left to work, i creep his reddit account and see he is making back and fourth comments with an OF creator and then procedeed to comment on more pages. I lose my mind and send him a paragraph saying im ending tbe relationship because of it. Our relationship is great, we have so much fun. Its just this one thing, regarding his sexuality. I dont know what to do? When he apologizes, he seems so sincere and i dont even know if im being manipulated at this point.",

    "title": "Je me suis fait arnaqué par VTOOLS : 50 partis dans le vide, et je ne suis sûrement pas le seul",
    "text": "Je pose ça ici pour prévenir, alerter, et peut-être réveiller dautres gens qui se sont fait plumer comme moi. Parce quà un moment, ça suffit. Le 3 avril 2025, je paie un abonnement à VTOOLS venture inc., un outil dautomatisation Vinted censé permettre le repost automatique de mes annonces. Fonction ultra mise en avant sur leur site. Ca nest pas la seule fonctionnalité mise en avant, néanmoins cest celle qui mintéresse. Je paie 19,99 . Problème : la fonction nexiste pas. Littéralement désactivée. Aucune info avant paiement. Service payé service jamais livré. Cest une pratique commerciale trompeuse. Je contacte le support. Après plusieurs mails, ils reconnaissent que la fonction nest plus disponible mais refusent tout remboursement, en se cachant derrière une prétendue renonciation au droit de rétractation. Service non livré, argent gardé. Quand jai signalé leur pratique à la DGCCRF, bizarrement leur ton a changé. Là où je navais droit quà du silence ou des réponses vagues, ils se sont mis à me répondre plus rapidement, à sexcuser vaguement, et à parler de résolution sereine. Dans leur réponse officielle à la DGCCRF, ils reconnaissent même que le service nétait pas disponible et disent quils vont me proposer un avoir ou un remboursement. Résultat ? Encore une fois : rien. Le 3 mai, malgré le litige en cours, ils me prélèvent à nouveau 29,99 . Reconduction tacite automatique, comme si de rien nétait alors que mon abonnement était pourtant résilié. Je les contacte immédiatement pour signaler labus. Leur réponse ? Vous navez pas résilié votre abonnement. Sauf quils savent parfaitement que : - un litige est ouvert depuis un mois - le premier service na jamais été fourni - la DGCCRF est déjà saisie. Cest totalement inacceptable de leur part de se permettre de me prélever une seconde fois alors quils sont pleinement conscients quil y a un contentieux non résolu. Ils nont rien fourni, rien réglé, et continuent malgré tout à encaisser. À ce stade, ce nest plus une erreur de gestion : cest un mépris clair du client et de leurs obligations contractuelles. Et ils le savent. Leur comportement est révélateur : silence quand ça les arrange, engagement oral jamais tenu, puis tentative de culpabilisation quand le client insiste. Classique, mais inacceptable. Donc : 49,98 envolés, pour du vent. Leur site est un sketch : - Aucun moyen de laisser un avis pourtant, plein de faux témoignages positifs affichés - CGV incomplètes pas de médiateur, pas de droit de rétractation mentionné - Pas de gestion des cookies ni politique RGPD visible. Jai donc : - Signalé deux fois à la DGCCRF service non fourni faux avis, - Prévenu UFC Que Choisir, - Créé leur profil Trustpilot le premier pour que ça commence à ressortir sur Google, - Construit un dossier PDF complet avec preuves, captures, factures, mails, et tout ce quil faut, - Et là, je prépare linjonction de payer. Même si ça me coute autant, leur manière de faire est inacceptable et ça doit cesser. Je sais que je ne suis sûrement pas le seul. Je veux juste : - Que dautres personnes témoignent si elles se sont fait avoir, - Et éviter que ça continue en silence. Leur réponse : rien. Pas un geste. Pas un mail depuis. Juste un système bien huilé pour encaisser et disparaître ensuite. Si tu veux mon dossier complet ou les modèles de courrier, je partage tout. À un moment, faut que ça se sache. Marre de voir ce genre de plateformes profiter de la confiance des gens. Voici leur Trustpilot nhésite pas à liker ou commenter : https://fr.trustpilot.com/review/v-tools.frhttps://fr.trustpilot.com/review/v-tools.fr Merci à ceux qui liront, relayeront ou témoigneront.

    "text": "Hey redditors, Fed up with manually prepping code for LLMs, especially on big projects? I built Lumen, an open-source CLI tool that auto-scans your project, creates a structured overview, and formats it into an LLM-ready prompt. It respects .gitignore, skips common clutter, and runs 100 locally. The goal is to give your AI deep, contextual understanding for better analysis, debugging, and refactoring on complex codebases. Early traction is exciting: 1400 downloads and 47 GitHub stars in two weeks! As LLM context windows grow, tools like this will be even more crucial. Check it out if this sounds useful.

    "text": "So, im at the unfortunate point where im thinking of breaking it off w the the guy im dating. We r both in our 30s and i want to know how i should. He has said a few things like why should the man have to win over the woman and hes not a big texter. I dont feel super pursued even though he has made time for me and we have gone on some fun dates. Its a bit on and off w him tho, periods of busy-ness then a really nice date. I do think he is actually busy and not lying about that, but im a stongnbeliver in if he wanted to he would. Hes not exactly inconsistent and i can tell he is putting in effort but its only when he isnt busy, once every 2 weeks sometimes. I have a little text written in my notes that explains this. It is not an ultimatum bc i am not trying to change him. I think a girl out there would love his dating style so im not trying to change him. Best to cut things off early. Im wondering men care to hear why or if i should just hit him w the so sorry but we arent a match. Good luck out there bc it doenst ultimately matter since we wont be dating anymore. TL:DR: Men do you want an explanation or just cut n dry during a breakup????",

    "title": "When is a good time to have sex with someone?",
    "text": "Im a 29 year old woman and starting to feel weird and insecure about my body count 4, I know its technically low to some people but hear me out My first was a 5 year relationship, we didnt have sex until a year of friendship passed and like 6 months of dating passed. 2nd was a 2-3 year on/off situationship that never led anywhere and eventually he asked to come back into my life but when I asked for what reason he ghosted me. 3rd was a would be bf who admitted he had abusive tendencies so I left And 4th was a would be bf who was consistent and perfect for a month straight and didnt even mention sex finally! I thought, but we did sleep together after a month of knowing each other and me spending the night as his place, I shouldnt have slept with him so fast cus he started getting distant And basically, all it takes for me to want to be with a guy is good mutual vibes and consistent behavior, all of which the above minus number 2 displayed. Im going to start waiting months to sleep with men. But men treat me right, even the abusive guy admitted that to me himself he didnt actually ever harm me or anything. In my memory based on actions alone he still treated me extremely well. I guess Im trying to figure out, how can I keep my body count low if guys dont technically do me wrong they just disappear on me after consistent behavior? Its a struggle because its not like Im getting dogged out, so in my mind and in my heart, its okay to share my body with them. Because my barrier of entry is I guess low. I was looking for a boyfriend but do I need to keep them at a distance for a year like I did with my first? That relationship turned out to be awful and life changing for the worst so its not like it personally yielded a better outcome, it just lasted long enough and was far past its expiration date to feel like I got all the clarity that we werent meant to be without feeling used. Its starting to get to me because now that Im older, men expect to move at a faster pace and admittedly I have a higher sex drive, and I thought I was better at reading people so thats why Ive been a little more comfortable sexually whether it be talking about sex or having it. Im thinking waiting 2-3 months of consistent behavior would help me FEEL better but even at that rate, a guy acting right for even 4 months straight and then is breaking up, its easy for my body count to rack up with that type of pattern. I know its all in my control but I like dating, romance and sex. And men tend to pursue me very strongly, and very consistently to the point where I dont notice many red flags. I think maybe I dont know my worth as a woman or what I truly deserve? Idk Any advice? Also, men always tell me Im perfect/theres nothing wrong with me and the one who recently got distant literally told me he wasnt being distant because I did anything..so wtf. The only thing a man ever told me is: Im too skinny and he need a thick woman the 2nd guy I gained weight since that comment And sometimes guys will ask me why my nails arent donecus they hurt my nails lol, but I paint them sometimes Also guys always tell me how much they like talking to me. So someones lying or I just have terrible luck or Im just bad at reading people? Also, Ive been told Im the best sexually by 3/4 of the guys the 3rd one I didnt do a lot with because something held me back, I guess the underlying intuition about him hiding something - his abusive ways Im attractive to where people assume I always have a bf but honestly Im humble and chill, and a homebody. I dont date a lot or meet people a lot so I usually think its fated when I do finally meet someone and we click.",

My credit union debt, from a few late payments during a rough patch, was sold to this deplorable company, and they turned my life upside down. Under the so-called oversight of Chief Compliance Officer, they showed no mercy or professionalism. Instead of offering reasonable solutions, they aggressively drained my bank account, leaving me with nothing to feed my kids or pay bills. Next, my car was repossessed, stranding us because I couldnt keep up with their relentless demands. Their website, is a jokezero help. Its like they thrive on ignoring people. Credit Management Corporation preys on struggling families like mine, using predatory tactics without a shred of empathy. Theyre a disgrace to debt collection. Stay far away from these heartless vultures.",

    "text": "Trigger warning : might be some details in here that are relevant to the story but might trigger some. Growing up I always knew that some of the things that happened to me were a little odd and maybe part of me knew they were wrong because at the time I knew I didnt want to tell my parents. I was only physically molested once by a male family member while playing hide n seek with my cousins. I was 4 and he was finishing high school or college. But since he was a family member I had to see him around a lot after it happened. also as I mentioned we were playing a game so he had taken me to hide somewhere dark where I couldnt see what was going on, I remember feeling weird sensations all over my body and my sense of touch was activated due to being in the dark so i could feel things I had never felt before but had no idea what was going on. Plus I was a kid so my biggest concern was not being found. As the years went on I thought of that moment constantly, slowly trying to piece together what had happened. I was able to do so by being in similar situations with other people or witnessing other adults that are family friends try to isolate other children in my family and then those children telling me what happened to them. It was quiet horrific now that I think about it to know how much sexual abuse went down in my house as a child due to my parents lack of boundaries and their inability to allow us to say no to people which only led us into pedophile traps. Anyway. Years passed and Im still terrible at saying no so I find myself in situations where I dont want to do something but if someone asks enough Ill do it just cause I feel like I have to. Sometimes that meant being 12 and video calling adult men even tho Ive very much only been attracted to women my whole life but due to that first initial interaction with that man I always felt a little confused. Ive tried to hook up with men via grindr and I hated every single hook up, in left feeling violated the first time even tho I seeked it out for my own curiousity as I found myself thinking and getting aroused by men but only in positions of power. After feeling violated I said Id never do it again but then I did it again with someone else and still felt violated. It was strange cause the first time I was molested or all those times I couldnt say no, I never felt violated, mostly cause I didnt know what was even going on but this time since I knew what was happening I felt gross. And still I cant stop thinking about it. Its like Im going out of my way to violate my body because of this some thing that happened to me when I was a child and Im an adult now who can accept it was wrong but still the thought of me getting abused again still arouses me even tho when its happening in the moment every part of me wants to run. Why do I keep doing this to myself and how do I stop ?",

We were madly in love for the next 4 years till it ended because of a misunderstandingsomething I dont feel like elaborating. But since then, I have felt kinda emotionless or cold hearted towards anyone coming in my life. Yes, I did manage to have feelings for other people afterwards but they were fleeting. Now, I just dont seem to care anymore if my current relationship lasts or not, I dont even put in the same amount of efforts like I did back in the day for that girl. On a side note, I dont even miss that girl, I dont even feel like talking to her but I mentioned her because It was only with her that I felt to be truly emotionally involved. Is this some sort of trauma of mine that has led me to become so indifferent? Kindly Share your views please as to what I should do. p.s I do have someone in my life rn and they are perfect in everyway but I just cant seem to reciprocate the same love to them and I know thats so unfair. I wanna better myself and could use some help. Thank you.",

We were madly in love for the next 4 years till it ended because of a misunderstandingsomething I dont feel like elaborating. But since then, I have felt kinda emotionless or cold hearted towards anyone coming in my life. Yes, I did manage to have feelings for other people afterwards but they were fleeting. Now, I just dont seem to care anymore if my current relationship lasts or not, I dont even put in the same amount of efforts like I did back in the day for that girl. On a side note, I dont even miss that girl, I dont even feel like talking to her but I mentioned her because It was only with her that I felt to be truly emotionally involved. Is this some sort of trauma of mine that has led me to become so indifferent? Kindly Share your views please as to what I should do. p.s I do have someone in my life rn and they are perfect in everyway but I just cant seem to reciprocate the same love to them and I know thats so unfair. I wanna better myself and could use some help. Thank you.",

    "text": "I met a guy through my online coaching classes. From the beginning, he was sweet, respectful, and kind. We helped each other a lot during tough times, especially emotionally. He always checked on me when I was low and supported me in ways that truly mattered. Somewhere along the way, he told me he liked me and I liked him too. But we made a promise: wed only talk about our feelings after our exams. There was just one thing that always stayed at the back of my mind his name. It was quite unique. Im not into novels or movies much, so when he told me his name was inspired by a novel, I believed him. I did ask about it once or twice in the beginning, but he was confident in his answer, and I trusted him completely. Later, my friend looked into it and told me the name was actually from a movie. Thats when I started to feel something wasnt right. Eventually, after a small argument, I stopped messaging him out of hesitation. My friend suggested I should at least talk to him once. So he texted him on my behalf. At that time, I still didnt know the full truth. My friend confronted him about his real identity and instead of explaining or clearing anything up, he just said he didnt want any mediocre people around and that he would talk to me himself. But he never did. He blocked my friend and then blocked me too. Even after knowing he lied, I cant bring myself to hate him. He never treated me badly. He helped me, listened to me, and was there when I needed someone. Thats what makes it harder. I trusted him fully, and now Im left with all these questions were his feelings real or was I just a joke to him? Why didnt he talk to me before leaving? My friend showed me the proof from his social accounts, so its clear he wasnt honest. But the strangest thing is he also stopped attending classes altogether. His last activity online was a long time ago. Sometimes I wonder if he might come back after exams maybe he will talk to me then. But I dont know. Its just a possibility not a certainty. And Idk even at that time I should talk to him or just leave like he left me confused and hanging. I didnt deserve to be left like this, without a goodbye, without an explanation. I still think about it more than I should.",

    "text": "Ive been thinking about this a lot lately after watching some friends come into money inheritance, crypto gains, promotions and... well, lets just say it didnt go how they expected. Heres the brutal truth nobody wants to hear: If you overspend when youre broke, youll overspend when youre up. I watched my buddy Jake go from living paycheck to paycheck to landing a six-figure job. Same guy who used to blow his last 50 on DoorDash instead of groceries? Yeah, now hes blowing 500 on experiences while his savings account stays at zero. The numbers got bigger, but the pattern stayed exactly the same. If you avoid accountability when things are small, youll avoid it when the stakes are real. That coworker who never admits when they mess up small projects? Theyre not magically going to own up to major failures when they get promoted. The person who cant have honest conversations about splitting a 40 dinner bill isnt going to handle transparent business partnerships worth thousands. Heres what really gets me: Wealth doesnt fix the gaps. It magnifies them. Money is like a spotlight. It doesnt create character - it reveals it. All those little habits you think dont matter? Theyre going to scale with your income, your responsibilities, your opportunities. The good news? This works both ways. If youre disciplined with 100, youll be disciplined with 100k. If you can handle feedback on small mistakes, you can handle it when millions are on the line. Start building the right habits now, when the consequences are manageable. Because if you cant survive the pressure of less, you definitely wont survive the pressure of more.",

He had some weird comments some times and was really explicit but i thought it was cool cause I didnt want anything serious. He told me he was looking for something casual and we agreed. We shared some photos and videos and everything was fine. Some days later he stoped texting me for some hours and when i ask he said he was not looking for anything right now, so I just told him that it was fine, i wasnt looking for anything either. We agreed again and he started acting normal again. Today he stopped following me on instagram and i asked about it. He said that he was not looking for anything, not even intimacy now. I asked some thing and he told me he didnt wanted to involved me emotionally and i was still confused cause we already agreed on not making things emotional. Now he seems really sure about his decision and he does not want to have intimacy, but he still ask for videos cause he says i really turn him on and my videos are the best I only sent them cause i knew i was gonna get something in return his d but now that i know im not, Im just confused. I dont wanna say no cause hell stop texting and not even reconsider having intimacy he said that he would in a future I might sound desperate but honestly i dont have a lot romantic or intimate life cause im pretty shy, and i really like this guy physically of course",

    "text": "I 28M live on the West Coast, my girlfriend 26F lives in Europe. Together for 1 year. We met up in NYC for memorial day weekend and its been great up until last night. The last time we saw each other was Christmas, and we didnt have sex because I couldnt get hard. I wasnt sure if this was because of a lack of sexual chemistry or a potential hernia Im dealing with jury is still out, MRI scheduled soon, but when Im alone for example, I can still get hard. Im attracted to her, yet sexually, were not on the same page. While engaged in whatever sexual activity, it feels one sided and she wont touch me unless I ask her to, and I feel like having to ask defeats the purpose. Last night, I made her cum with my fingers, and she asked what she could do for me after the fact, and has made it clear shes willing. This is still a turn off for me and I let her know that maybe the sexual chemistry isnt there. Im a pleaser for the most part, but Id still appreciate some simultaneous reciprocation. The fact that I couldnt get hard while making her cum is slightly worrying. Weve had great sex prior to this, despite me usually doing most of the work. Telling her that I think it might be due to lack of sexual chemistry lead to a short argument before going to bed. This morning, I woke up to her kissing me on the cheek before leaving to a different hotel. She left me a note saying Thank you for everything. I tried chasing after her but by the time I got dressed and got downstairs she was gone. It seems like shes made her decision, but Im still willing to fight for the relationship and work through the sex stuff, seeing as were compatible in every other way. TLDR: Is it worth ending a relationship over the potential lack of sexual chemistry?",

    "title": "Husband m40 does minimal chores and I f30 am tired.",
    "text": "3 years marriage. No children. He works 35hrs a week 7 hr shift and no nights. I work 48hr week. Sometimes I do 60-72 due to overtime as need money. I work 12 hour shifts mixed with day and nights. Now I have no issue doing more than 50 of the chores as I do like the house clean. However, I have asked and do expect husband to do some chores at least. First it started with him just washing dishes occasionally. Nothing else. Told him, it wasnt good enough. Eventually he started to occasionally hoover once a month and putting clothes in washing machine occasionally. When hed take the clothes out he would just dump them on the floor. Again I said he needs to step up as I cant be working more hours, bringing more money home I earn double his salary, plan holidays and outings and be expected to also do nearly every chore. I also have to sometimes go care for my elderly mum and do her chores for her. Hes on defence. Lots of arguement. Eventually, he start to do a little more. Maybe 10 more. He starts saying how I didnt fold my towel once so Im also messy. But its not the same. I do many others chores that I forgot to fold the towel as I was rushing to work. We are not the same. Yet he tries to use that as defence. And hes arguments are always Im tired. But how can be that TIRED all the time. I mean I get tired too, sometimes feel under the weather but as an adult still have to carry on. But what frustrates me is he is an adult and not even doing the minimum. I am tired of telling him what needs to be done coz Im not his mum. Its like he has eyes, he can see. Eventually I got fed up. I moved out and was ready to file for divorce. I lived alone for 3 months. He begged me to come back in that time. I didnt listen initially. Overtime, I could see when I visited him, the place was tidy. I noticed he had been cooking. So he always had it in him. I said I needed more time to think about it. Continued this for a while then eventually I moved back thinking he finally gets it. I moved back, and slowly could see he was reverting. However, there was definitely a remarkable improvement. So I just focused on the positive. But over time, I was once again starting to do more and more. Most recent example: He was off two weeks from work. I am still at work. Despite this, he only managed to cook once. Only when I asked him multiple times, did he dust and hoover. And even then half the dusting of vacuuming wasnt done, so I had to end up doing it. He spent most of his two weeks off vegetating. I still managed to do the rest of the chores. Eventually I had one day off after working 3x 12 hour shifts. My next stint at work was going to be 6x12hr shifts on nights. Yet on my day off, I managed to clean the bathroom, dust the whole place and hoover, do laundry, clean the rest of the house, wipe mirrors down, change sheets, iron etc. The next day before Im due to start my night shift, I managed to cook, clean the kitchen, plate his food, take rubbish out, do laundry etc. I sent him a message when he gets back from work if he could just do a quick hoover in the living room as I ran out of time. Thats ALL he had to do. He said no problem. I came back from work this morning, he hadnt hoovered. I was upset but thought its best not to react. I sit on the bed for a bit and just start thinking to myself what am I doing with my life? He wakes up, sees Im a bit down. I try to diffuse situation as I dont want to argue as I know if I mention it, hell argue. Eventually, we were having a conversation about work and finally I said btw why didnt you hoover? His response was he had a headache and was tired when he came back from work. I said okay, if he could later do it in the evening. Few hours later, I hear hoovering. Its still early afternoon. Whilst all the bedroom and living room doors are wide open. He This is where I kinda lost it. I said why would you hoover with all the doors open knowing Im sleeping and have night shift. Straight away he start arguing back saying he will hoover whenever he likes. I said but now I got a headache and this is why I asked if you could have done it yesterday whilst I was at work or even do it later in the evening. He yelled that he will do it at a time it suits him. I genuinely feel he did the hoovering at that hour and with the doors open on purpose. But hard to prove. Why does he act this way? Ive tried to do more than 50 chores, I even moved out, I even thank him for doing chores when he does do them, I even have compromised more than half way in the sense that I dont expect the house to be clean ALL the time when I was alone my place was clean all the time and thats what Im used to. But it seems his compromise is 5 and such a battle to get even that. TLDR- husband does minimal chores. Leads to statement. Dont know what to do.",

And IF20 was so done with himM26 and I told him yea I am why? And then he started crying saying why? Why? We used to be together all the time and I dont even talk to anyone because I only want you and I felt so sad for him because for me its always been him so I explained to him how I was feeling that I wanted to be more than a b0oty call and he said he was gonna change for good because he was sure about his feelings for me so and he did change for good on June he asked me to be his girlfriend and we been good we fight very often but we always reconcile at that moment I know he loves me I love him but recently thoughts about my boyfriend and my sisters situation have come to my mind and that torments me, he already apologized he said he wish he could go back in time to change it but I wish everything was different... my sister and me are good we are good sisters and we would never fight over a man, but I hate this feeling...",
