Everything kinda fell apart in my life. Im not sure when, its been a series of mishap after mishap. I try my best to stay positive because it could always be worse but man Im tired. I got dumped by an immature boy who used me for sexual experience and it wrecked my nervous system in ways I didnt know possible. He wasnt even a bad person, we just werent a good match but Ill be damned if I let my own naiveness hustle me like that again. Damn do I miss him. Id never been treated as nicely as he treat me sad thing to say. Heres my issue. I have major work to do on myself. Major. I need intense therapy. I need to focus on my health and get into the gym. I fucking hate myself I cant stand to look at myself. I self harm regularly and I cant stop. I will forever be wearing long sleeves and pants for the foreseeable future. I just. really fucking hate myself. So how the fuck do I move forward? How to I get out of these terrible spirals? How do I get over my ex who was no good for me? The pain is unbearable some nights. The memories of our good times haunt me. That river is going to carve just an inch deeper into my cliff side and collapse everything if I dont do something soon. Im scared man. I dont know what to do anymore.",

    "title": "Im facing some very serious domestic violence charges, but Im innocent.",
    "text": "Location: Kentucky. So this is a very long and difficult story to tell. I was engaged last year and it was a toxic relationship. I caught her cheating by messaging other guys and even a girl on her socials. I kept forgiving her mostly because I didnt think she got physically involved with any of these people. But we still fought about it. In the middle of October we had a really bad fight. I tried forcing her to leave. We broke up for 4 days. She posted about the fight on her facebook. But we ended up getting back together. Things went ok for a while. But she exaggerated the story so much that her ex put an epo on me so I couldnt be around his kid. Which caused us to fight and break up again. All of this happened thanksgiving day. I thought things were fine when we went to bed. We talked and said we could work through it. I woke up the day and She had left in the middle of the night. I tried to talk to her but she ignored me. So I decided to give up. I started talking to a new girl maybe 3 days later. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY my ex got jealous and pressed some really horrible charges on me on December 12th over the fight we had in October. With nothing but filtered pictures she had taken herself and with the txts we had sent each other. She just went down to the police station and lied. Now Im looking at felony charges. Im wanting to take the case to trial but Im scared. I dont trust my lawyer. He was supposed to get the pictures thrown out because she added a filter but Im not sure he will. Ive sent him these photos 3 times already. He emailed me Monday and asked if I could go to Walmart and have them printed showing the timestamp and what phone they came from. My question is: is there metadata embedded in a non digital copy of a picture? The Da has the same pictures, why could he not see that they are filtered? None of this seems fair. I feel like Im about to get railroaded by my lawyer and the Da. I need some advice! Please?",

    "text": "My 19F boyfriend 21M just graduated university and moved back to his home country due to family obligations. We planned to do long distance while he figured out how long he was staying there and where hed go to grad school and such, but since he moved hes been really depressed. It isnt an incredible place to live and hes living with his family, who he has a strained relationship with. He says he hates it there and I would too, but due to certain family obligations it looks like he might be stuck there permanently. Now hes saying we should maybe break up because he wants me to be happy and doesnt want me to end up stuck there like him. He keeps saying we should be friends and that he loves me but he doesnt think he/his circumstances can make me happy. Im just so lost. We had a plan to stick together forever and hes going back on all his promises. It isnt an objectively bad country, I think I could like it if I eventually lived there. I feel like hes making this decision so rashly due to his mental health being in such a poor state. He says he loves me and he wants me to be happy, and that he doesnt think I could be happy there. But I know I could, as long as we were together. I know were young but I consider him the love of my life, hes my person and I dont want to lose him to this. I hate seeing him miserable and I hate being so far from him. I cant imagine just being friends with him, but I also dont want to lose him entirely. I dont know if I should just accept the breakup and try to stay friends, or somehow try to convince him that we can get through this. What can I do to not lose him?",

Now, he refuses to get a job, doesnt care for the way he looks and overall is dismissive about improving aspects of his life. We have talked and discussed that we would like to move in together soon. But, this still isnt a motivation for him to get a job. Instead, he stays home while I work trying to save money for many things one being our first place together. Ive started to notice that Ive grown to be irritated at times around him. The conversations, the foods, the activities its just all the same. Ive tried brining up new activities to try together and he just flat out refuses. Has no interest and doesnt even want to try. Hes a sweet guy, hes very patient and understanding with me and I truly do love him but I just hate this new version of him. I cant tell if my relationship has come a dead end or if Im just too comfortable and seeking more",

I myself finished school with some hefty student loans and am trying to help shoulder/alleviate some of those burdens for my daughter. I have found that my budget will allow 700/month with an initial investment of 5000. My household income is roughly 200k a year and we live in RI. I know RI has a 529 plan set up with collegeboundsaver, but based on my household income the overall tax benefit for me isnt necessarily a big pro provided I did my math correctly I would get like 50 back in my state refund, which means I am free to pursue other 529 plans was considering a Vanguard plan but admittedly I am having some issue selecting a plan -- open to suggestions to research if anyone has any! However, given my daughters age, I was wondering if maybe this wasnt the best route? Would an acceptable approach be to invest in an ETF for the first 5-10 years and then shift the funds into a 529 plan? Also open to any other recommendations to look into!",

    "text": "My girlfriend is fairly insecure and I want her to get therapy so she can be the best that she can be but she refuses to even accept that. I dont want to overstate it, but her insecurities give her anxiety and she struggles with some basic things. She had an eating disorder as a teenager so she is still very insecure about how she looks. She was also bullied as a child and is insecure about looking stupid in front of other people and that really limits her from doing basically anything new. She gets anxiety when eating out in public alone, sometimes to the point that she will cry or simply just not go. All of these things combined means shes not very independent. She finds it difficult to make friends and she relies a lot on me for fulfilling her social needs. And furthermore she has very little ambition, I assume because she is worried about failure and looking stupid. This wasnt the best move by me, but I did try to sit her down and get her to at least admit shes insecure to the point that it affects her daily life. My thinking was that by having her admit it, she will then seek therapy to address these and be more independent. I wont lie, her lack of independence and reliance on me does wear me down. Im literally the opposite of her. Very ambitious, outgoing, high social drive, I make a point to step outside of my comfort zone all the time. But I think she is such a good person, and I care about her deeply. Which is why I really want her not to be shackled by her insecurities. I know she has desires, but she just does not have the drive to chase them and seize what she wants. I feel like Im her crutch, and I dont feel like I can be that forever. Its exhausting. So I either need advice on how to address this, or I need someone to tell me Im looking at this the wrong way.",

He was super controlling and my siblings are not the biggest fans because I aired it to them. Fast forward several years, we reconnected and dated for about 6 months. Was way better and seemed wed both grown up a lot, then he slowly started acting childish again in situations, we would talk about it later and he would be way better about communicating but couldnt own up in the moment on his actions. Finally he acted like a fool when we ran into his ex dated her after we broke up the first time. Ended things once and for all after that. We ran into each other recently and ended up chatting here and there after that for the last several months. We met up for coffee a few months ago and it was just nice to catch up. The problem is we have really strong chemistry. I want to try to be friends but whenever Im around him or talking to him I find myself wanting more, and we are very obviously attracted to each other in a I cant stop touching this person way. We met up again recently just to catch up again and he wants to get back together. Essentially told him we cant do that and that theres no way that would workbut then saying our goodbyes, ended up making out in the parking lot in a really hot way. Then texted him days later reiterating that we cant get back together and he was cool about it but clear that he does want that. My family and friends are REALLY over him at this point and cant see why I would ever give this guy another chance. Their opinions do matter to me which is why I havent done anything with this situation and we are super social so if youre gonna date me you have to vibe with my people. Im afraid theyd never approve. I worry that I will never meet someone Im more compatible with. The good parts of our relationship are of the same intensity as the bad What do I do Reddit",

    "text": "26 F. Sometimes I feel disgusted over my past relationship with my ex boyfriend. I felt like I really did settle to the lowest point at that time in my life even tho I did love him at some point. I feel disgusted mostly because he was cheating on me almost our whole relationship even tho it wasnt physical cheating till 1 year and 6 months later, I still feel like I wanna throw up and cry, and scream because I dont know what I was thinking..I get flashbacks of having sex with him sometimes and Im over him, I have had sex with one other guy since we broke up 7 months ago but I feel ashamed because Ill think to myself: how could I have been so stupid and naive? Has anyone else felt this way with an ex or person?",

    "title": "I dont want to grow up. I always feel sad in the moment because I know the future wont be the same.",
    "text": "How do I live in the moment and enjoy what I have without thinking about what I wont have in the future. I am f15 years old. I miss my childhood, I miss every memory I have. I know people say that its normal to not want to grow up, but I feel like my life is over. My childhood dog, my best friend we got when I was 3 years old. He is 12 now. He is still healthy, but I can tell he is slowing down. I dont know what I am going to do when he dies. I miss the memories I have with him when he used to still play with toys, and when he could still hear. I miss the times before covid, when life felt perfect, my dad was still sober, my mom still seemed happy, and when my brother and sister were still young and innocent too. Now that I am older, I always worry, think, and stress about the future and things that will happen. I always wonder when my dog is going to die. Some nights I have to put my hand on his belly to see if he is still breathing because I am scared he will die in his sleep. My dad is a bad alcoholic. He was sober for many years until covid. Now he drinks every night, and tries to hide it from the whole family. We know but cant do anything. He refuses therapy and we cannot afford rehab. He drinks and drives, has even driven me while drunk. I love him so much but I also HATE him. I miss my childhood, when he was fun and seemed happy. We played tennis together, played sports outside, got icecream, or treats from a store nearby our house, you name it. Now i dont even see him all week because he comes home from work extremely late every night I am already in bed for school the next day. Whenever I am with him, silence. No conversation. I can tell he is tired. I never do anything with him anymore. I feel like he is my dad but at the same time I dont. I want to become close with him again and do the fun things like we used to, but it just wont be the same. I dont feel comfortable being around a liar, but I want to help him. Sometimes I wonder how old he will live. If he will get sober and live a long life. Or if I am going to be in my 20s getting a phonecall that my dad is dead at the age of 60. My grandma, I love her so so much. She has picked me up from school once a week for years now. I love bonding with her. Recently, I have now been the one driving home in her car for practice to get my lisense when i turn 16. I miss when I didnt have to have responsibilities. I miss being the little kid that sits in the backseat of the car. I always stress about her too. I love seeing her so much. Just today, she didnt let me drive home from school which I thought was odd. When I got in the car and sat down she told me My ribs hurt too much I just cannot get myself to get out of this seat and walk to the passenger. I know pain everyonce in awhile is normal for old people, but this just concerns me. I genuinely dont know what I will do without her. The most heartbreaking thing for me, I think about it everyday, my sibilings. I LOVE my brother and sister with my whole heart. I am much closer with my brother2 years older, we have more in common and get along better. My sister is awesome too but she is 5 years older so we arent as close. My brother and I used to fight a lot. I hated him sometimes. He ate all the good food in the household and made so many messes. But now, I miss that. He is 17 now and more obsessed with himself than ever. He freaks out over food with carbs, only eats eggs and meat and other shit that people eat to try and build muscle and stay lean. Last year he had a horrible eating disorder, got bullied for his acne. His girlfriend at the time was being bitchy to him and he got depressed. He started smoking weed to cope and help him fall asleep. He got out of that toxic relationship now. He gained back all that weight. His acne is better. But hes different. He cares too much what people think. He still smokes all the time now. Some days I will just be in my room doing my makeup and next thing hes in my room blowing smoke in my face. He got caught once last year but hasnt been caught again. I dont know what to do. I cant snitch on him because 1 Hes my bestfriend and if I snitch he will never trust me again. 2 If I snitch on him he will snitch on me for things I shouldnt of been doing that he knows about. I hate seeing how he is. I miss when he was innocent, even if we did not get along at all. He is a junior so I still have another year with him, but at least a few times a week I think about when he will move out for college. He always talks about how excited he is to have a fresh start, get away from our dad has been very verbally abusive towards my brother, and how he wants to start a new life. As selfish as it sounds, I sometimes hope that he doesnt get into these colleges, or that they will end up being too expensive. My sister is in college in state still living with us but will move out sometime in the next couple of years. I dont want to be left behind in the house. I dont want to be here feeling, empty, in and empty home. My brother and sister gone, my dog dead, my dad always drunk and never there, my mom sad and unmotivated. I want my childhood back when I didnt have to worry about being the last one. I miss my middle school. I went there my entire life, it was everything to me. I had so many friends and I was surrounded by people i knew my whole life. I wasnt the cool or popular kid, but I was happy and surrounded by so many familiar faces. Now, I am in a highschool, the highschool I didnt want to go to. Its and AMAZING highschool, and I am unbelievably grateful for the opportunities I am given, but its not the same. The highschool I wanted to go to my whole life I didnt get into, simply because I didnt have a legacy there and that is all that highschool cares about. Majority of my middle school got into that highschool and went. Everyone got to move onto the next chapter together, while I had to start fresh. I HATE change so much. I stand by tradition. I have so many new and amazing friends at my highschool, but it will never be the same and I have this missing piece from me knowing thaf I will never get to be that kid at her old school ever again. I miss family vacations. They arent the same anymore. Not me and my brother picking on my sister in the car, laughing, driving her crazy and my dad yelling at us to stop, us giggling in the backseats. Now its silence, us with our airpods connected, music blasting. My brother texting away with all of his jerky friends. My sister, completely zoned out in her own world. My parents, silent in the front seat. Me, in the middle of everything, where I like to be, sitting there, realizing nothing will ever be the same again. My childhood show, is Stranger Things. I was rewatching it for what, the 4th, 5th time? Ive lost count. I remember Summer, Maybe 6 or 7 years ago, being in the living room. It was another sunny, innocent happy day. My mom and sister started to get really excited about something talking about a season 2. They rewatched S1 for me, letting me see it. I watched S2 with them after that. I became obsessed. In 4th grade I had a poster in my wall. I know its a popular show and its everybodies favorite, but no one will love that show the way I do. It makes me so sad watching it now, thinking back to the times when there were still more seasons coming out. Now all the characters in the show are grown up, and so am I. It will never be the same again. I get too emotional watching it now. I saw someone on instagram say I was in middle school when it first came out, now I am married with a kid. That broke me. I hate nostalgia, it makes me sad. I hate feeling happy because I know the moment wont last. You never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory is what people say. No, I do know the value. I cant stop thinking about it. I feel like my life is over. Everyday, things run through my mind. Knowing, that in 2 years my dog will be dead and my siblings will be gone and im left behind literally kills me. I always say I am excited for college and to move out and fresh start, but i am not. Life will never be the same again and It is ruining me thinking about it over and over and over and over. sorry that this was unbelievably long and probably boring, but I needed to get it out, whether people respond or not. Anyone else understand or relate? my friends say they feel sad too, but I can tell its not the same. they arent the youngest child being left behind. no one knows what its like.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend have been in an relationship for the past 6 months. I got introduced to her by our mutual friend who lets call alex. My girlfriend is an extrovert and is really nice to everyone and is really sweet, I also am pretty sure that she has ADHD that she refuses. Before i asked her out i was friends with her for almost 2 months and before i made the move i made sure that she was single at that time , i confirmed it both by asking her and also by asking alex. When i asked her out , her response was that she wasnt sure that she wanted to be in a relationship. We still kept in contact after that since we are in the same class. A month after i asked her out , we got into an relationship. Ever since that its been good, But there are some problems with this. Just yesterday when we went out as a groupsince we are in the same friend group , one of the guy from our group who came with us was asking her to come for a drinkthis guy has already asked her out and got rejected, happened before i came into the picture, but she is doesnt know that im aware of the fact that he asked her out, to this she said okay because the drink that he was planning is like a month into the future. Just yesterday when i was speaking with alex about this he told me that she and her ex were still in an on and off situation when i asked her out. I just feel so confused now , please help me. Ive decided to break up with her. I just wanna know whether the decision that i made it correct or not.",

    "title": "My 18 F dad 45 M is trying to get back into our lives, but my mom 43 F doesnt want him to, so hes asking my opinion. I dont want to choose sides, what would you do? LONG",
    "text": "Im making it sound like Im fatherless, Im not. I love my parents whole-heartedly, my parents love me with their life, but do they love each other? Absolutely not. Heres the story: For as long as I can remember, my mom and dad would have heated arguements in front of me and my little brother who is oblivious to all of this because they would argue in Tagalog, and he doesnt understand it at all, so I have to bear the brunt of this mess. It got so much worse when we moved from the Philippines to Canada 2 years ago. My mom is taking a college course, so she and my dad had to work part time jobs because they couldnt work full time without a work permit the process is long and complicated and caused my parents to stress which added fuel to the ongoing fire. My brother and I were both still in school help out around the house, but I too have a part time job coffee shop barista 14/h which wasnt a lot but was something. While my mom was juggling college, kids, a job, cooking all the food, and managing the household chores in general, my dad couldnt even keep a stable job, and he barely helped with the housework. He was still in charge and would boss around my mom almost all the time. Clearly, this frustrated my mom and their arguements would get louder and longer. But it all came to a point when my dad quit his most recent job. The reason being the work construction/installment was too much and was too heavy on his body which I find a little strange since hes really athletic and in shape basically since I was born. But its his back and joints that were too painful due to early arthritis apparently from his body coming from a tropical country with 40 C summers not being adjusted to the ridiculously cold weather of Canada. When he came back from a business trip, we found out that he had quit his job and doesnt want to work anymore at all. Words cannot describe how frustrated and stressed my mom was at this point and started arguing again the day after he came back. In the end, she gave him an ultimatum: its either you find a job and support us or leave this family and go back to the Philippines not exactly what she said but it was smth like that. Obviously, he chose the sensible decision of going back because apparently, he would rather leave his family than to get a job. Dont get me wrong, I love my dad, but this is just ridiculous. So for one long month, he has been lazing around the house while my mom was the one doing the work again and making arrangements for him to head back. During this time, I was actually dying inside, and my mental health was struggling. My parents have been together my entire life, why fall apart now? This was very difficult for me to process and go through especially when the people who raised you, cared for you, and loved you are now basically going at each others throats. And I actually cried a lot the night before he left. Whats worse is that I didnt even get to see him off at the airport because I was at school. Its been a month since that happened, its just us 3 in my family now. But for the past couple weeks, my dad has been secretly texting me because my mom doesnt want us talking since she blocked his number on my phone and blocked him on my Facebook. We had been chatting through Instagram then and would check up on each other sometime. Recently he asked me a question, I miss all of you, dont you want me to come back? Im afraid to answer, I havent answered yet, because I think that whatever I say about this is going to affect what happens in the future if Im not careful. I dont want to choose sides, I dont want any part in this, this shouldnt have even happened in the first place like wtf. I just need these two to make peace. I dont care how, and I dont care if its on good terms or bad terms, I just need all this to stop. But first I need to answer his question, but I dont know how to without choosing any sides. So Id need some opinions or suggestion first Anyway, could you tell this is my first time posting here?",

    "title": "My relationship with my dad and stepmom has deteriorated to the point giving me flashbacks. How do I still have a relationship with my baby brother with everything going on?",
    "text": "To say my stepmom and I dont get along is an understatement. Theres a lot of history here, and you can read the full version here https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/ntDReWeT0y. But the short version is that she was originally my dads affair partner and I was the one that found out about everything at like 12 years old. I was caught in the middle of all the drama and sort of de facto in charge of keeping my abusive bio mom from killing herself. Because of the affair, what it did to our relationship with my dad, and continued accidental exposure to sexual content like nudes, my bio mom got full custody of me and my siblings. The court documents are incredibly damning against him. He was only allowed supervised visits - that cant be attributed to court bias as my dad likes to say. It was an absolutely horrific 3 years that gave me PTSD. I have been diagnosed by 2 different clinicians. We finally got taken away by the state and had to have a guardian ad litem. Who told my dad she wrote the most 1 sided, scathing report of her entire career to remove custody from bio mom. While I dont fully blame my stepmom, I think shes a bad person for not giving two fucks about how her affair would affect innocent children who had a mom she knew was deeply mentally ill. Like you couldnt pay me enough to do what she did. Im equally pissed at my dad, but at least he didnt abuse me after getting custody like she did. After we came to live with our own father, this woman alternated between treating me like a romantic rival and ignoring my existence completely. The other post goes into more detail, but I think she crossed the line into abuse. My therapist agrees. I feel like she always hated me for now reason, and if you ask my dad, he says that he doesnt understand why. She entered the lives of 3 deeply traumatized children in the worst possible way, and then acted like it was our responsibility to build bridges with her. But no matter how much we tried, it was never, ever good enough. I feel like a victim of actual, clinical gaslighting with the way everyone pretends everything is normal. I know my narrative is colored with a lot of emotion, but every behavior described and incident in the other post is true. I am not just making this up or misreading the situation. Fast forward to now, and I see her way more than Id like I visit my baby brother her son about once a month. Hes showing someconcerning signs of having very anxious attachment and he feels like everyone is mad at him all the time. He is constantly managing the feelings of the adults around him, and its horrific to watch. So I go there to try and give him a steady, non-reactive, safe adult. Plus I just really like seeing him. I love him so much and hes just a really great kid. Anyway, Ive been promising him for a while that we would go on a trip together because we havent been on one for a long time. I decided to plan my own trip to Punta Cana. And I invited everyone but her. Im paying for myself and my baby brother, and my dad and other brother are paying for themselves. Its not even to be vindictive, even though I hate her. Its more because I dont want to pay 4k and have the vacation ruined because we didnt dance around eggshells in the right way. She has a history of either sequestering herself in a room or outright leaving over the dumbest things like when I said I hated her college town - not even to her - which was where I lived during the worst of the abuse. So I just dont want to deal with all that, and she probably doesnt want to go anyway. But I know shes mad that my dad and brother are going. She told my brother it was inappropriate I didnt invite her, even though Im a grown adult and do not have to invite someone Im not even on speaking terms with. She has always hated when my dad chooses to do stuff with me and not her. My brother is reporting passive aggressive behavior. Hes trying to manage her emotions and is my stepmom is now taking just him on a spite trip to Iceland without inviting my dad. My dad told me that he made a deal with her to let her go on a trip with my brother alone if they got to go with me. Im not insane that this is extraordinarily manipulative, right? I feel like this has turned into yet another stupid competition over my brothers affection when all I wanted was to have fun with him. I feel so gaslit by her entitlement to be invited that I am having legitimate flashbacks. Shes just like my mom and I feel absolutely insane because I dont have a fucking clue why she would expect an invite. It wasnt even malicious intent - I genuinely cannot handle another time where I have to literally beg her to participate or watch her abandon us when I say the wrong thing. We literally dont talk when I visit my brother, like sometimes not even hello or goodbye. She has hated me ever since I sent a mean email to her during the affair. My siblings have all confirmed that she has been cold, unloving, and emotionally abusive to them to and they see it done to me. So I just dont fucking understand why this is pinned on me. Now, I feel so destabilized that I dont know that I can continue to maintain relationships with these people. Its not about the trip so much as it is the 10 years of pretending everything is normal and that if Im good enough, she will finally love me. Its about having someone abuse me and no one care. But I desperately want my brother in my life. How do I even begin to navigate this? I have been begging my dad for family therapy, but he is dragging his feet.",

    "title": "School refusing to return my husbands pocketknife claiming they can hold it for 3 years. Is this legal?",
    "text": "Location: Louisiana Five months ago, my 6-year-old son noticed a pocketknife clipped to the outside of his mesh backpack at school. It had been accidentally left there by my husband that morning while packing his bag. He typically clips it to his jeans, and it mustve caught on the mesh when handling the backpack. My son never noticed it until lunch, when he reached into his backpack and saw the knife hanging from the side. He immediately told his teacher and she told him to bring it to her, which he did right away. She asked if he recognized it and he said no and later we realized it wasnt the usual knife my husband carried, which added to the confusion. The teacher brought it to the principal and confirmed it was not inside the backpack, just attached to the outside, sort of just hanging there. Instead of being praised for doing the right thing, my son was pulled from lunch and questioned by the principal alone, with no attempt to contact us. He told the principal he had no idea how it got there and even asked her to call his dad. She didnt. To make matters worse, our 9-year-old who attends the same school was also pulled from lunch and made to eat in the principals office while being questioned for 40 minutes. She pulled out the knife and held it in front of him while interrogating him and asking him personal questions about our home life. Again, no parental contact. He has PTSD, anxiety, and ADHD, and is medicated under psychiatric care due to past neglect, abandonment and witnessing his biological mother being arrested and taken to jail. Hes also been on a 504 plan due to his ADHD and anxiety with this school since 1st grade, which I feel was violated as well. This experience triggered intense fear and confusion because he thought someone in our family was going to jail. I only found all of this out because my 6-year-old casually mentioned it in the car after school. I was never contacted by the school. I spent two agonizing hours calling to get answers and didnt hear back until nearly 5 p.m. My husband immediately took responsibility, explained the situation, and confirmed the knife was his. Even the assistant principal who spoke with our son said, Poor baby, you could tell he genuinely had no idea what was going on. And still, they insisted on punishing him with a full day of in-school suspension. Because policy is policy. A 6-year-old child. Who had never been in trouble, who followed the rules and was honest with his teacher in a scary and confusing situation. I refused to allow him to be punished for an adults mistake. More importantly, I refused to send the message that if youre honest, youll be punished. His honesty that day might have prevented that knife getting into the wrong hands and a much more dangerous situation from occurring. Because they refused to backdown on their punishment, I withdrew him and began homeschooling. The emotional toll this took on both of our sons was enormous. Our younger son already struggled with school anxiety, and this completely shattered the fragile trust we had helped him build. We submitted formal complaints and an appeal to the school board, the superintendent, and the Louisiana Department of Education. We were ignored. We asked to see the video footage of my son entering the school that morning and we were given the runaround for weeks and then told we couldnt see it. At the time, they also told us the knife would be returned at the end of the school year, which I could not understand. With school ending next week, I went today to try and retrieve the knife. Instead, I was informed they will be keeping it for three more years under some vague claim of statute of limitations and evidence despite the fact that: No one was harmed. No charges have ever been filed. Weve received no notice of any investigation. There is no documentation, no policy, and no written explanation. Ive now contacted the districts Director of Child Welfare and Attendance, who supposedly gave this directive. Im waiting for a response but wouldnt be surprised if it goes unanswered again. My questions: Can a public school legally hold our personal property not part of any active case or formal process for three years? And what do they mean when they say theyre holding it for evidence and due to statute of limitations? Do I have any grounds for action based on how this was initially handled.. especially the lack of parental notification and emotional impact on both children? This entire situation has caused my family months of anxiety and distress. I know this post is long, but if anyone has insight or advice, I would be deeply grateful. Thank you so much.",

    "text": "I am on a throwaway account because I am out of options and out of the fear of judgment. I, F18 have been in a relationship with M19 for 2 years. This relationship is the most healthiest and secure it can be aside from a few issues. I have emotional needs that arent being met and as an extremely sensitive person, its really important that I get these needs being able to be comforted when I cant self regulate at the moment, being able to talk to him with seeing evident annoyance or irritation on his face when Im acting childish. Ive communicated how much it hurts me to physically and emotionally feel his distance and absence during those times and even as we talk, we never come up with a solution or compromise. Nowadays Its just him waiting until Im over something for us to move on. Of course, we can talk things out verbally, but this has been a constant subject in our discussions since almost the beginning. My friend group has introduced a new guy. Well call him Jake. Jake, M20 is sweet, funny, and extremely attentive. Hes eager to speak with me despite my soft spoken voice since often and intentionally my friends and boyfriend speak over me because they dont really notice Ive spoken in the first place. He doesnt find my excessive rambling annoying and theres no moment where hes thought I was being childish. Hes also eager to talk to me and has made me laugh more often than before. Maybe its because Ive been emotionally isolated but these actions are making me fall for him slowly. No matter what I do, even if I ignore him, he finds a way into my thoughts. All I feel is guilt. Ive been told not to tell my boyfriend, Ive been told to break up with him, but honestly Im afraid of hurting him or making a big mistake. How do I move forward from this?",

    "text": "Hi everyone! I 21 F just need some advice on how to process this I guess because 2 of my friends may end up dating 21 F and 22 M. Recently I started talking again to a good friend of mine M and we have been hanging out both with my friends and alone. One of my best friends F who I introduced to him liked him and asked him out because they had been talking a lot and she did end up getting rejected. Things have changed though and the guy now seems to be interested in her and asking her on hangouts. I started thinking about it and need a way to process if they were to date because at the moment Im hoping they dont so my friendship does not change with any of them which is one thing Im scared of. I had just regained a friend whom I had talked to a lot in middle school and talk a lot to now too and this would be my best friends first relationship too and Im nervous if she will switch up when it comes to our friendship. How can I process this in a better way?",

    "title": "Lawyer didnt show up to victim hearing following a domestic violence case?",
    "text": "Location: Florida A friend of mine is involved in a Domestic Violence case. The way it all went down, she nearly died. Lost consciousness. These injuries are documented. Both her and her partner ended up arrested and due to the nature of my friends injuries, she does not want to drop the charges. That said, she had officers arrive at her door fairly late one night to let her know that they were having a hard time reaching her over the phone that she had a victims hearing scheduled for the next day. They did find a physical copy of a piece of mail that I suppose had gotten misplaced that verified that the victims hearing was scheduled for that date and time. She showed up at the time dictated at the correct courthouse and they refused to allow her to give her testimony because her lawyer was not present. Which in an ordinary circumstance I would imagine the lawyer would be aware of and then reschedule as this could change the trajectory of the charges. However, the lawyer says she was never informed and is basically refusing to communicate about it. Ive seen all of their correspondence in text. All she keeps repeating is that the next court date is scheduled for _____ date. But thats not a victim hearing. Thats a court date. Neither of us know how this works so I figured I would ask if any of you have been through this? Is the lawyer being negligent? And what would you recommend so that my friend can seek justice and be able to tell her side of the story as the victim? To give more context, the lawyer she has was appointed by the court as a pro bono attorney because 2 public defenders in a row were excused due to conflict of interest as they had both also been chosen at one point or another to represent the other party in this case. So I cant say for certain the lawyer she has now would treat the case any different as shes not being paid, but she seems very cold and unwilling to give any information or guidance that my friend is seeking from her regarding the victim hearing. Tldr Lawyer is avoiding any conversation about a victim hearing instead of rescheduling. Is there a way around this and is this negligence on the lawyers behalf?",

Our cash buckets is for things like trips. We add a couple hundred a month to it. We struggle with the balance of adding to our retirement/investments as a priority and also saving for the down payment for the next house. When we sell, we want to also add cash when we upgrade so our mortgage is similar to our current of 4500 PITI. Thats what our cash savings account is for right now. With this goal in mind, what advice would you give us on balancing this? Addiitonally, any tips on retirement/investments? We currently max 403b/401k and contribute around 10.25 to calstrs pension. Thanks! Any feedback is appreciated.",

    "text": "Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post and I need some brutal honesty from the guys and the gals. I 22f and my partner 22m have been together 5 and a half years. Weve been through some shii together. I once caught him receiving pictures of his girl best friend that he would game with and sometimes late at night. When I confronted him about it he said they used to talk about being horny together and she just sent them to him and he never sent any. Trust gone but I decided to try and forgive as this was just before our 5 year anniversary if known for a year before confronting him. He made the decision to stop talking to her, I never asked him to. Turns out he made a fake Snapchat account to talk to her, there was nothing inappropriate from what I could see but he was still hiding it right!? Not only that he had messaged a sex worker asking how much her services were. I confronted him about it and he said he was just curious and that he would never physically have done anything. He did though seem genuinely sorry about the situation and said it was stupid. But is it only stupid to him because I found out??? Also he pays for pictures of women to be sent to him on Telegram and probably only fans too. Now Ive never had an issue with him watching porn or lusting over girls on Instagram, because I do it too. But paying for it just seems that bit too far. But is that my fault for not setting the boundaries at the beginning of our relationship? Ive put on a lot of weight since we got together, I guess I got a bit too comfortable in the relationship so sometimes I think its due to me not looking good anymore. But we still have sex, but since I confronted him weve been having less sex but hell still get off to girls hes paid for on telegram and often in the bathroom in the morning before work. Were going to be moving in together next month so I need some brutal honesty. Is my relationship just doomed? Is he addicted to the thrill? I feel like Im constantly waiting for the next thing hes going to do and I feel like the next thing would be him physically cheating. Am I the problem? Im I over thinking? Am I too forgiving? Please Help Me!",

    "text": "Me 25 F and my now ex fiancé 31 M have been together for almost 5 years. When we were first started dating I was fresh out of an abusive and just overall toxic relationship, I was maybe single for about 3 months until me and my ex fiancé officially started dating. He was aware of all the trauma I had gone through during my prior relationship and promised me that he wouldnt be anything like that. I was going through ALOT of depressive episode at times as well. Of course things were fine at the beginning of the relationship until I started noticing some qualities about him that I did not really like. Here are a few examples, he was very aggressive to strangers especially at the gym when someone would get too close which really put me in an awkward spot the way he spoke was almost very stern and kind of like a its my way or no way type of thing. And this really caused me to feel almost unsafe to communicate with him because I didnt know which personality I would get. And throughout the years, the outburst got worse and worse. To the point where it was happening in public, he would say something in a certain tone and it would ultimately cause me to cry, which would really piss him off even more. Its happened infront of his family multiple times and bless them for always taking my side. Because they know how he is. My reason for staying is because I truly love him, and the good moments we shared when he wasnt a complete dick. And I thought maybe he was just misunderstood and could be fixed or changed. But what really caused me to leave was the back to back events that happened within a 3 month time span ONTOP of previous blow outs weve had throughout the years.The biggest thing was when he yelled at me Infront of my entire family.. and a huge blow out we had on a trip with his niece and nephew over something stupid such as sunscreen. He always told me my communication was not the best and but I really think it stemmed from him speaking to me in a tone and me always scared to talk to him. I have communicated multiple times on the way he spoke and he just says its his personality. So I made the decision to leave for my own mental health because I then started to become mean towards him and basically looked for any excuse to be by myself and not around him. I was hurting him too by doing so. I took a 2 week break and found myself at peace but at the same time oddly enough its hard to let go of someone I was with for so long and tried my best for, especially after being disrespected on multiple occasions. He decided to go to therapy after I left and kept telling me he wants to work it out between us and Im just so scared to go back and feel the same way about him. It almost like I cant unsee the way hes acted towards me and hurt me. Watched me cry and beg him to change his ways. Its been a month without him and I feel lost ?",

He will make comments about how all I want to do is eat. Yet I only have 2 meals a day. A light lunch and dinner. We are on our honey moon and have been eating 3 meals a day. He continues to make comments about how much I eat and doesnt see how its hurtful it is. I will bring it up and tell him how it makes me feel and his response is Im sorry the truth hurt or Im sorry you took it that way. And couple therapy according to him is a bad idea and we shouldnt do it because that just shows we wont make it as a couple.",

    "text": "Location: New Jersey Hey Reddit, I need some legal advice. My internet provider, Altice formerly Optimum, just notified me about a legal request for information related to a list of IP addresses. This is concerning because my account with them was closed back in November 2024. The legal request seems very broad, asking for all sorts of documents related to these IP addresses, including subscriber info, usage details, and even application data. Im also really worried about just how much information Altice will end up handing over because the request is so broad. My main worry is this: Does this list of IP addresses mean that all of them belonged exclusively to my internet account? There are multiple IPs listed, and Im worried it might include IPs that were never mine or were used by other subscribers. I tried calling Altices records department directly to ask if they could confirm which of these IPs were even assigned to my account. They told me they cant disclose that information to me directly. Now Im trying to figure out what this all means for me, especially since my account is closed. What kind of information would Altice even still have from that time? And does this legal request automatically mean all those listed IPs were mine? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated",

    "text": "Warning: a lot of context. A while ago i M21 went to a volunteering camp. Apparently we werent allowed to keep ahold of our tents. We had to lend them to the club who transported them in a separate vehicle to be distributed at the site, then picked up after the camp. Now at the camp i was approached by one exec who asked me if i had any because i had gotten drunk at the camp two years ago. He asked me if i had threw up that time, i told him no. He told me to hand over my bottle and that i could drink from it but just a little that night. Another exec was extremely condescending to me the next day. He would loudly and insincerely praise me for cutting cardboard a task we were supposed to do to make trap boxes. When i had volunteered to place said boxes on a ten minute walk, he singled me out and said oh, realname might not want to do it right in front of everyone. This was when we had already gotten from the carpark to the front of the walk. We about to start. I was on two hours of sleep and could barely feel anything. Please note I didnt tell him, but i have autism and i think it shows. So i just said Ill go. They told me to meet this guy, and when i asked where he was, one of them told me he had gone to sleep. And it turned out the apparently sleeping exec was right there. He told me i had lied, that I had vomited two years ago and that i wasnt allowed to drink, period. I dont know about you but id be pretty sure if i got drunk and threw up at a camp. It also happened two years ago. Two years. But I didnt even bother arguing at that point. One of the execs told me Look, if you dont remember, then it probably happened. That guy wasnt even there. The next day the exec I mentioned earlier kept showering me with fake praise for basic tasks, and made sure to say my name as much as possible, touched me on the shoulder when i told him not to, said cmonnn lets be best friends when we were about to take a group photo... you get the idea. I didnt feel unsafe. I was just extremely annoyed and uncomfortable. I have no clue why they acted like this, but if it was because of what i did two years before then i could probably understand. The thing is, most of them werent even there back then. Needless to say, I didnt want to deal with these people. Now this was very stupid of me but i didnt collect my tent for a while partially because he was there. But later they sent a message out saying they had found a tent from the camp. I asked them if they had mine. They said theyd search. No reply. I asked again the next week. The message got viewed. No reply. I asked again. No reply. I got the student union involved, sent an email, and finally I got a reply. Apparently they couldnt find it. I asked again, this time in a facebook group for uni lost property, apparently their system worked so well they still had two or three peoples tents in storage. Do you guys think it would be pushy or petty to ask to see the tents in person or nah? The tent cost me 200.",

    "text": "New to Reddit, so sorry if this isnt the best formatted post. Me and my sister F 20 have never gotten along. Ever. Shed argue I was the golden child while Id argue I was just trying to get attention. We have different dads. Hers took her for the week while mine just completely abandoned me. All that to say that maybe I have always been jealous of her. But shouldnt younger siblings always be at least a little jealous of their older siblings? To actually give context, I used to have a Tumblr blog. It wasnt at all popular, just random posts here and there. But when my sister started dating her now boyfriend M 19 he started interacting with my stupid posts. So we started bonding. When my sister was gone hed come over to hang out with me. It made me feel special that this older guy is just coming over to hang out with me. One thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. I didnt feel bad, he did. Im a guy so I just thought it was that stupid oh my parents are gonna kill me if they find out Im queer! Kind of freak out but no he was too busy feeling sorry about himself for not being loyal. If he actually felt bad he wouldve created boundaries and stopped sleeping with me. But he didnt. I feel like I treat him better than she ever could. Whatever, anyways, recently my sister has started talking about marrying him. Even went looking for rings. Im almost even mad that she would do this to me. I talked to him and he only said that we cant let this keep happening! But he doesnt stop. So should I keep seeing him or just stop entirely?",

    "text": "Wont go into too many details cause wife may go through my phone, but its getting increasingly harder to go on. One day I was some kid having a great life, next thing you know Im in my late 20s and life has never felt so challenging before. Theres a million things I feel like I should know by now that I dont. Still trying to figure out how to be a good person, and what good even means. I feel no wiser, stronger, braver or smarter than years past if anything I make more mistakes now than I did before. The only difference is this time I seem to be alone. I was never too close or comfortable with my parents so I never go to them for advice. My sister was never the best sister and though were trying to start again I still get an off feeling. To make matters worse my marriage has put a severe strain on my friendships, causing all of my closest friends to distance themselves greatly -one cutting me off completely as of recent. There are things my wife will not talk about, or I know its best not to bring up for whatever reason. So Im I to keep all that within from now on? Theres a lot more nuisance to this and A LOT more depth but the concept is the same how can I go on forever when there are things eating away at me I cannot let out of my mind anymore? I dont wan the answers, I dont wan a guide, I just wan to be heard and to have someone try to figure things out with me. No judgement, no letting my fears and insecurities feed into theirs, just listening and offering perspective and whatever advice may be available sadly the older I get the harder it is to find this and Im scared of the day its no longer available it feels like its closing in fast",

    "text": "Location: AZ, US Hi everyone, long time reddit lurker and first time account creator. I might have fucked up today. I went to target to pick up some groceries and browse, and I picked up some little potted flowers that were near the front of the store and put them in the cup holder in the cart and did the rest of my shopping. I went to self checkout and went to put my groceries in my cart when I noticed the flowers in the cupholder. I double checked my receipt and sure enough, I didnt pay for them. Ive never shoplifted before but I sort of panicked and put the cart back in the cart return with the flowers inside and went home, and I did that because I didnt want to bring the flowers back in and just set them down. Am I cooked here? Is there any reason Target would prosecute over flowers I didnt technically steal? I paid for all of my groceries and never took the flowers home but now Im scared that theyre going to be monitoring me in stores now when it was completely accidental and the flowers didnt leave the parking lot. If someone else stole the flowers from the parking lot, would I still get in trouble for being the one to leave them in there? Im sorry if this is silly but Ive never had this happen to me before and Im not quite sure what to do or if Im overreacting about this",

    "text": "So for context my 19f younger brother is about 10 years old. This might seem like regular sibling fights but i think theres a lot more to it. Theres times where I dont say much to him or make a joke which leads to him blowing it out of proportion and crying to my parents. My parents obviously take his side and end up shouting at me for no reason. Ive noticed my brother gets a lot of joy and validation from it to the point where he instigates fights or straight up fabricates a fight to see me get shouted at. This also is normal kid behaviour but my question is how to bring him out of this validation mindset? How do i change our relationship so he doesnt feel the need to be the good child in front of my parents?",

    "text": "Location: India I worked as a freelance data analyst - full time for a US-based NY company from March to November 2024. I was laid off after I asked for my October month salary in November 19th, My contract clearly outlined monthly payment terms. I worked for 19 days in November, but they never paid me for that month, even after repeated follow-ups. They also owe me two separate 50 stipends for language learning support agreed beforehand - not written. Despite over half a dozen emails and professional communication over the past few months, Ive received no resolution or clear timeline. I finally sent them an invoice and set a payment deadline, mentioning that Ill consider formal recovery channels like the NY Department of Labor or small claims court if unpaid. What are my actual options to escalate this? Im based in India, so how would enforcement work if I need to go legal? Has anyone dealt with something similar? Would really appreciate advice or steps that worked for others in similar cases.",

    "title": "Conveyancer failed to register my property for 4 years and missed a management company/ service fees leaving me with a bill.",
    "text": "Location: UK So as the title suggests, 4 years ago I brought a leasehold property, conveyancer at the time charged me all the relevant fees and I paid, including land registry fees. They also identified the landlord and associated ground rent, 1 management company and associated service charges which I have been paying. Fast forward, Ive come to sell the property and discovered it wasnt registered, went back to the conveyancers asked them to sort it out. Having already got a buyer lined up, I was under time pressure, this was back in November. Im still not registered with the land registry, delays being caused because another management company has to provide a certificate of compliance. Its cost me 250 for a certificate of compliance from the management company I knew about, 250 250 210 to the company I didnt know about for compliance certificate, notice of registration and deed of Covent, 820 in unpaid service fees over the last 4 years, and 650 for a legal pack from the management company I didnt know about in order to sell. My question is, can I claim all this back from the conveyancer? The additional fees I wouldnt have been able to afford at point of purchase because I was a first time buyer stretched to the max with no spare emergency fund, so had I been told about them at the time of purchase I would have had to pull out and find somewhere else. The service charges I knew nothing about and had I been told about, I would have had to consider other properties. I understand if Id known I wouldve had to pay these fees anyway, but am I entitled to some form of contribution? The other element is, If not for these delays in registering, which I paid to be done 4 years ago I wouldve completed before April, meaning my stamp duty liability for my onward purchase increased by 1400, could I claim any of this back?",

    "title": "I 40M Broke up a week ago, ex41F wants back.",
    "text": "Throwaway account since my ex knows my real account My ex41F and IM40 had a toxic relationship, we were basically fighting several times a month, sometimes several times a week, over really stupid things. One time a month ago, right before going to bed on her sofa we sleep separately due to my snoring, I see some dental floss where I am about to put my phone and a glass of water. I take some tissue paper and pick it up, and when I start walking away, she asks what Im doing. So I say that Im taking out the floss because I think its nasty and I wanted to put my phone and a glass of water there. This turns into a fight. First, she tells me Im calling her nasty, which I wasnt, and she says she uses it twice to save money. The fighting lasts like an hour over a damned dental floss. Another time, I do the dishes at her place, shes sick, so I fill her dishwasher full and about to close, and she gets mad. She says I can fill it even more and overfill it, which turns into a big fight since I didnt do it her way. However, at my place, all I ask for her to do is to put the dishes in a specific place since it speeds up me doing the dishes significantly. Its been almost 2 years, and she still doesnt do it, and when I bring it up, she says its hard to remember. It feels unfair that I have to do things her way, but she does not do the same thing for me. Two weeks ago, she says it was long since she took a swim, and I invited her here since I live near the ocean. She says she doesnt want to swim here because theres oil on the beach. I get defensive and dont believe her because theres 0 chance there is any oil there or it would have been removed or the beach would have closed down. This turns into a fight, because I didnt believe her and her story. After some time, she changes the story, saying beach for her is also coastline it could be similar in our language, and eventually she says it wasnt the coastline nor the beach, it was at a small harbor. I had to say Im sorry for not believing her, and she didnt take any accountability. A couple of months into the relationship, something happens, I bring groceries home from the store, and she empties them into the freezer. When she takes the last item, she leaves the door to the freezer open and goes back to the empty freezing bag. I tell her, Why was going to say, why didnt you close the door. Then I realize it could come off the wrong way, so I dont say the rest, but she insists I tell her so I do. I ask, why didnt you close the door before going back to grab the bag When I speak it out, I realize Im criticizing her and with total regret and feeling ashamed. She then tells me that didnt happen, she did close the door before and telling me I am gaslighting her. I never been in such a situation before, so I stood my ground and claimed what I saw was real, and things escalate. It turns into a fight, and she says things like, Is this worth breaking up for because I dont tolerate such behavior like gaslighting? I eventually lied 2 hours into the fight, telling her I must have seen wrong. When she feels ashamed, like with the dental floss and the freezer, she turns that shame to me. Im not perfect, I admit I can get defensive, and its not good, i have other flaws too. We broke up 1 week ago, Its been really tough. Right now Im in a phase of What if and this morning she contacted me. I havent read it all but it starts with her saying things like I was nothing to you and later turns into I love you about 5 A4 pages of text in between. What do i do, can this be worked out and is it fixable? When we have good times they are really good, probably the best times of my life but lately its just fighting and its so draining of my energy :",

    "title": "Newlywed in a Long-Term Dead Bedroom: He Just Admitted Hes Never Been Attracted to Me. What do I do now?",
    "text": "Reddit community, help. Please. I love my husband. Truly. We had an incredible emotional connection when we met and a very loving relationship since. Mostly My husband 30 and I 25 recently got married, but weve been together for a few years. Even in the early days of dating, we never truly clicked sexuallyand I thought it was just me. I assumed my inexperience was why things felt off. But even when the sex was enjoyable, it always felt disconnected. There wasnt any real intimacy. He was rough, rarely wanted to do foreplay, and would only ease up if I raised my voice or said ow. He gets in the mood when Im not in the mood. He kisses and hugs very aggressively. This was confusing because outside the bedroom, hes always been a gentle giant. I also like a dominant man, but this didnt feel right. And it was always on his termspositions, frequency, timing, everything. Still, I thought maybe wed find our rhythm. At first, we were sexually active often, but within a few months, things dropped off dramatically. He told me sex felt like a burden. That hurt, but we had a good conversation about it. He said it wasnt about meit was physical. We tried vitamins, lab work, exercise, diet changes. For a moment, I thought wed turned a corner. But a week later, he quit everything and said it was too much work. He chalked it up to low libido LL and told me maybe I just had a crazy high libido. He also started blaming our five-year age gap. I didnt want to pressure him, so I backed off. He asked me not to initiate because it made him feel emasculated. That rubbed me the wrong way, but he was setting a boundaryand I respected that. I havent initiated since. I never want anything between us to feel non-consensual. Now were four months into marriage, and he wont touch me at all. He even flinches when I go to hug him, like hes afraid it might lead to moreeven though I never initiate. He also wont take pictures together, hates leaving the house, and doesnt want us to show our wedding pictures on social media. Ive pushed for communication, encouraged him to see a doctor, talk to a therapist, try marriage counselinganything. But he shuts it down every time, saying he just needs to work through it.Umm yes! You do! Thats what Im trying to help you do!When I bring up my needs or how Im feeling, he tells me Im overreacting or blowing things out of proportion. Despite all this, hes continued to say he loves me. Hes called me beautiful, sexy, hotand assured me its not me, its him. I believed himuntil last week. We finally had a truly honest conversation. It started off hopeful until he said:I dont know how to tell you this I just dont find you attractive. I havent for years. Apparently, its been that way since shortly after we became official. Over. 3. Years. Ago. I was stunned. I asked why he never told me, and he said he didnt want to hurt my feelings. There was no apology. No real acknowledgment of how deeply his confession might affect me. Since then, Ive been spiraling. I feel like every compliment, every hug, every kissit was all a lie. Now when he calls me beautiful, it physically hurts. When he touches me, I flinch. I havent brought up any kind of intimacy since. I avoid the topic. Hes initiated sex a couple of times only now that I dont want to have sex and Ive made excuses or pretended not to notice. I agreed onceand felt absolutely disgusting afterward. And now Im stuck: I want to appreciate the effort and his honesty but Im so hurt and Im not sure where to go from here. Telling him I want to pause sex would only make the original issue worse. And honestly, hes barely initiating anyway, so maybe it doesnt even matter. My libido is less than zero. I dont even want to take care of myself anymore. I know Im not a supermodel. But Ive never had issues like this in past relationshipsnever felt this unwanted or heartbreakingly insecure. Im not ridiculously skinny, but Im not overweight. Im active and fitmy job requires it. Ive gained a few pounds during the relationship, but nothing major or even that noticeable. Trust me, my mother would tell me if I had. I dont want to make any big decisions while Im feeling this emotionalbut I dont know what to do next. If we could fix things I would like that. I want the life we dreamed of building together and I know hes capable of it if he would just put in the fing work. But if hes not willing to, then shouldnt I respect myself enough to go? I dont know if I have the inner resilience to leave even if I did decide to. I do really love him but something has to change before I lose my mind. TLDR:My husband and I have never had strong sexual chemistry, but I thought wed grow into it. He recently admitted hes never been attracted to mesomething hes hidden for years. Now, as newlyweds, he wont touch me, wont communicate, and refuses to get help. I feel shattered, unwanted, and unsure what to do next.",

    "title": "Do I 21M need to continue with my relationship with my 21F gf?",
    "text": "For a bit of context, my girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. Early in the relationship, I made some mistakes not cheating that really hurt her. At some times, she wanted to break up, but we worked through it. I took responsibility and changed. She had some toxic behaviors too, but shes also worked on herself. Weve both grown a lot. However, ever since those early mistakes, shes taken the stance that any problems in the relationship are mostly my fault because I was the one who messed up first. And yeah, I get it. I did hurt her. But it feels like Im the only one whos expected to keep improving or making things right. There have been times where she told me not to do certain things because they would upset her but then she goes and does those same things herself. The only big thing she has done was that I accidentally came across with the conversation she had with her best friend where she was talking about other guys calling them cute, saying they smelled good, giving them compliments. That really hurt. I confronted her, and although we talked it through, that was probably the moment I started feeling differently. At first she seemed sorry and tried to fix things, but eventually she got mad at me for being insecure and not being able to move past it. Since then, Ive pulled back emotionally. I stopped being the super loving boyfriend I used to be. But time passed and were still together. Lately though, Ive been feeling weird. I enjoy spending time with her and we still have some good moments, but somethings missing. For one, physical affection is really important to me, and shes not into it much. She doesnt say a lot of loving things, and we havent been intimate in about 6 months not even making out. I miss that closeness. Shes beautiful. At times, I wonder if it would be better to end things, but then I think what if I regret it? I also miss just being with my friends because other circumstances I distanced myself from them, especially my childhood friends a lot of them are girls, but I dont feel anything romantic toward them. I just miss having fun and hanging out with them but I dont want it to be weird. Lately, my girlfriend and I have been fighting a lot. Theres a possibility we might start living together part-time soon, which could be a new chapter but I dont know if thats a good idea. Right now, it feels like the only perks I have in the relationship are some hugs and kisses, a few dates, and someone to talk to. But honestly, I feel like I could have that with my friends too. I want to go to parties and hang out with people I care about, but while Ive always made the effort to spend time with her friends, shes never really tried with mine. Also at some times I feel like we should break up but then magically she starts being lovely and we have some intimacy and I feel like Im so in love. I dont know what to do, I still have feelings for her, but I feel like Im settling for less than I need. I dont want to hurt her or make the wrong choice, but Im not in the best spot either. Maybe I just to used to at her that I dont want to end things or are we doing the things wrong and we can change for the best of us?",

    "text": "For context I 13f like my friend cash 14m. We have been friends for a month or 2, but Ive known him for three years. Ive had a crush on him for 3 months. Ever since we became friends, I noticed that he seems very interested in our conversations and hes always paying a lot of attention to me when Im talking. Which I know sounds just like what a friend would be, but its different. Like Whenever were in a group conversation with his friends, he always finds a way to include me. And A lot of my friends noticed that whenever were in a room together, he seems to be turned more towards me or like always facing me. And One time when we were with his friends someone had brought up his ex. Which obviously is probably a pretty touchy subject. but he mostly kind of like downplayed the relationship saying stuff like it wasnt that serious or I didnt even really like her so Im not sure what that means but??? Idk. But weve seemed to get pretty close after the past month to the point that people keep asking if were dating. A lot of people have told me they think he likes me back but Im not sure. I hope you guys can give me advise on what you think or advise on how to tell him. Maybe I should wait? Idk. If you have any follow ups, just ask. And cash if youre reading this, I really hope you like me back cause itll be pretty awkward at school.",

    "text": "My F friend M and I live together and spend lots of time together. Early on into meeting him he would let it rip. I would ask him to excuse himself to go to the bathroom or say I found it gross the farts were frequent, long, and wet sounding. He would make comments like its not disgusting, my butthole is singing to you - which would make me a lot more uncomfortable and feel disrespected. Lots of time has passed and he STILL frequently farts in front of me at least 15 times per day. Even his chiropractor suggested him cutting out dairy, but the same day he bought a cheese platter. Everytime he farts he looks at me and smiles, and just before he does it hell freeze whatever hes doing and put his arms up in the air over his head and scoot his butt out like hes blasting off or something. It gives me the biggest ick Ive ever felt, literally makes me want to gag. Ive asked him so many times to not fart in front of me on purpose, and have even expressed that it makes me sad because I feel like when he laughs about it its showing me that he doesnt respect that it makes me uncomfortable. When he sneezes he also does the loudest most earth shattering sneeze and refuses to cover his nose/mouth, and Ive asked him many times. How do I get him to stop farting around me and thinking that its all a joke???",

    "text": "Hello, I really didnt know where to go for this. So for context, I have a next door neighbor who is 66 years old I will call her R and her mom M. She has a severe lung disease so who knows how many years she has left on this planet. I take her to get groceries and other stores because she cant walk anywhere without feeling winded after a couple steps so she vents her frustrations to me because she doesnt have any friends and only really talks to her son. She lives with her mom who is obviously older who stresses her out and doesnt give her any privacy. She writes down every number that calls her, times how long she was on calls, has to have every single door in the house open so she can watch her at all times, doesnt allow the ac to be turned on or even have the windows open. The mom is constantly breathing down her neck. In fact R sleeps in a tub in a separate bathroom because its the only room with a lock on it. And on top of that M wont let anyone but R bathe her. R has already told her its hard for her to do so because of her lung disease having her out of breath constantly. R is afraid to properly stand up for herself because the house belongs to M so she has the threat of being kicked out. So about the son well just call him S, she doesnt want to live with him because one day his dog attacked her and shes been scared ever since to be at his house. And accord to R, S will never give up that dog because it saved him from a breakup. So I was wondering should I report for elder abuse? How does that even work when the mom is way way older. Id also be afraid that they would know who called because R only really gets to talk to me when Im able to take her to get groceries. I feel awful for her but I kind of feel helpless in this situation. Sorry if I worded things weird Im very tired right now.",

    "text": "Ok, so first off Im 21f, and recently started dating my bf again after like a six year break, where we mainly chatted and saw nobody else. We both had super busy work schedules. So thats why, but we werent official, but still dated. So you get the situationship it was. Ok so we got back together last year in September, so its been like 7 months dating again. Since we new each other for awhile we hooked up like January and February, and havent done much since. Well now I been noticing some changes, and I know not to get too much in my head about this. So I learned from reading advice and tips on when to test, and test after like 4-5 weeks,because Im irregular on cycles. Now to my main point, apologies for the lore, but context on why Im iffy about telling him. Given thats how our relationship is, my BF is 23m, and well hes stated despite what we did the beginning of year he wasnt ready for children. Mainly because he wants us me to be financially stable.. which gets me on edge because I have a full-time job as an income nurse, and I do part-time elsewhere. He completely ignores my caregiver job as a job.. So its iffy, and ta this point I took some tests and its very faint. Personally, Im ok with if I am pregnant or not, Ill wait at a later date to test again, to see if it changes or not. Im neutral on that, but I know his opinions so Im low-key expecting to break up with him if Im pregnant and if reacts negatively to it, but if he wants to be supportive as he stated he will be if I turn out pregnant then I will do my best. Sorry, I just dont know if I should tell him?",

Im not the type of person who likes to be comforted when crying I wanna get everything out first and then be comforted so when he tried to hold me I gently said no, he understood and pulled back Not even 10 minutes later were chilling on my sofa hes scrolling on his phone Im scrolling on mine and he asks me to give a blowjob I dont even know how to feel right now except hurt and maybe disgusted? Idk Im just so in shock. I asked him why he would think its okay like what on earth could have possessed him to ask me that when I just finished crying and he says I have no idea I asked him to leave my house because I felt like I couldnt be around him or rather I didnt want him to be around me.",

    "title": "Small Claims Case - Breach of Contract Conversion: NYS",
    "text": "Location: New York. Im suing my ex in small claims court over a car. We financed the car in 2011, her responsibility was 100/month out of 400, I paid the rest and insurance and most of the repairs. Car still has a lien, so the contract trumps the title which only has her name on it. She made six total scattered payments. Ive been paying the car ever since. breach of contract in 2024, We broke up, but still shared the car. Then one day this year I texted her that I was coming for the car. She told me the plates were off, that I was a co-signer and that she was keeping the car. Next day, she had the title reissued with only her name had to be illegally. The plates arent off the car i have pictures and she is still driving, I am not a co-signer contract says co-buyer and since were co-owners, Im assuming she cannot do this without reason conversion. Her defense will be that I did not have a driver license at the time of the purchase and that I moved out of the apartment, like the car is a part of the amenities. What are my chances of winning, getting compensatory damages loss of use and punitive damages?",

    "title": "Mom is spiraling through depression",
    "text": "Hi, this is going to be a really complex thing to describe, but its gotten really tough lately in the house. So basically, a few years ago my grandmother fell and ended up paralyzed from the neck down, this was awful for our family as we were so close. We took care of her at our house until she eventually passed away around 2 years ago. Since then, my mom has gotten worse and worse by the day. She spends every day chainsmoking cigarettes and looking at and adjusting her tax documents she became obsessed with taxes? Somehow?. She does it ALLLL DAY. She became agoraphobic, she hasnt left the house in 2 years. She hasnt renewed her license or anything either. I hate to say it, but Im starting to build resentment, especially because my dad is doing quite literally everything, he works, comes home, cooks, does the laundry, he does everything for the house I help out where I can, but I work nights and long hours so Im gone from like 6pm-6am and need to sleep on mon-fri. She doesnt do anything productive at all and we cant even hold conversations with her anymore. Not to mention she doesnt even show appreciation to my dad at all for what he does. She hasnt gotten him a birthday gift or Fathers Day gifts and it just hurts my heart for my dad because hes the best man on earth, hes so kind and Im seeing him being worn down by being in this 100/0 marriage. Hes spiraling into depression too. I hate walking down the stairs and seeing him sitting at the kitchen table and just staring off into nothing because of how miserable he is doing all this work. Im also worried for my moms health, this might be TMI but Im 90 sure she has a severe UTI or something. This morning she used the bathroom and I went after her and the smell was so bad I threw up I havent thrown up in 5 years and I used to be a plumber. Ive already tried talking to her and I get brick walled out of it or she just isnt listening at all. Sorry if this is so jumbled, its just getting unbearable and I really miss my mom, and dad. How things used to be when they were happier.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are turning 4 years together this year. I have a stable job with good compensation, and he also has a stable job with a higher salary than mine. We already live together. The thing is, hes still legally married and has a childa special needs childfrom that marriage. Theyve been separated for almost 7 years now. The separation happened because his ex had an affair, and he was the one who ended things. When we met in 2021, they had already been separated for nearly 3 years. Hes a good provider for his child, which I admire. But sometimes, I feel its too mucharound a quarter of his salary goes to supporting his child. Meanwhile, at home, we split everything 50/50rent, car, groceries, bills. Im starting to wonder if I can still keep going with this kind of setup. When we met, I had just finished chemo and was bald, a cancer survivor. I cant have children, and he accepted me completely. In return, I accepted his situationthat hes married, has a child, and carries a lot of responsibility. But now, Im feeling torn. Part of me wants to be married someday, to feel secure about our future. But how can that happen when a large portion of his income goes to his past life? His ex already has a rent-to-own house and previously got a car through installment. Meanwhile, were just renting. And to be honest, Ive never received anything financial from him to feel pampered or appreciatedas his partner now. When we travel, I often shoulder most of the expenses because he cant afford it. He has loans to pay off and ends up with just a little money left. Even our dates are rareonly a few times have we gone to a nice restaurant. We dont celebrate monthsaries or anniversaries. Hes a good man and a good fatherbut here I am, still feeling like somethings missing. I sometimes question if I can still bear this. Because at the start, I told myself I accepted him as he is. But now Im wondering: is accepting everything the same as being truly happy?",

    "title": "Is college really worth it?",
    "text": "I 20F have been struggling with the idea of going to college for a long time. Its pushed down your throat from the beginning of high school that at the end of your 4 years, youll have to go to college, but the idea never really excited me. From the time I started showing interest in what I was going to do after high school up to now, every plan I ever got even the tiniest bit excited about got laid to rest very quickly. In middle school, I wanted to be a veterinarian. My mom said Im too sensitive for that and I wouldnt enjoy it as much as I thought I would in her defense, she was probably right. My freshman year, I wanted to be either a childs psychologist or a substance abuse therapist. I was told by many people they dont make money and that I should aim high financially speaking. My senior year I REALLY wanted to become a journalist after I had become the editor of the news section of my school newspaper and even had an editoral published in the city newspaper people even wrote into the newspaper about and complimented it! and the same they dont make a lot of money speech reared its ugly head once again. My senior year pasted by before I knew it and I still had no solid plan for the future. Two years have passed since I graduated high school, and I am still in the same place I was back then. My old school friends are moving away, renting their first apartments, one of them has already had a children, anothers gotten married, and here I am, in the same town i started it working a shitty part-time, feeling like ive just been stagnant for the past two years. Recently though, Ive started to notice something about myself. Since I was a child, weather has always fascinated me. Im talking tornados, hurricanes, windstorms, sandstorms, stuff like that. Since its tornado season, my sort of weather fixation has come back around and it got me thinking. Ive been trying to teach myself these weather terms, really diving deep into how tornados works, looking into atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics, and stuff like that. I truly think, if i really wanted to, I could be a meteorologist. From what Ive read they pay quite well, so that shouldnt be a concern at all. To finally get to the main point of this post, I guess Im just worried that Ill be stuck with debt for the rest of my life. College is expensive and I wouldnt say Im financially comfortable in the slightest, especially recently, but I really dont want to live in this state of waiting for something to happen anymore. So, to finally get to the point. Is college really worth it? Especially now since everything damn near costs an arm and a leg? Any advice would be appreciated!",

    "text": "My case: Street dog licked on the healing ulcer wound. Condition-III rabies exposure Its day 6 today after my 1st anti-rabies vaccination. I had never been vaccinated for rabies before this. I went to my nearest government hospital and told these things to two different doctors, one started claiming that this comes under condition-I rabies exposure and go home while the other said go home and sleep. They are just arrogant and taking it lightly. Then I asked them both to write the declaration that why HRIG isnt being given to me with their signature, but they both refused! WHO organisation strongly recommends to get HRIG along with the ARV in my case. So what to do now? Location: Rajasthan",

I have so many problems that weigh on me heavily and is completely avoidant of any of it. He tells me I can talk with him, but when I do, he talks over me, avoids the conversation, or he will listen but I can tell he really doesnt want to hear it. He has every right to protect his peace, but I feel so deeply alone, it breaks my soul. Im really going through a hard time, it feels like Im always going through a hard time because problems just keep coming. Ive lost interest in conversation with him because whats the point? If he cant be present for me at my worst, I really dont want to pretend to be happy for his sake. Im tired of pretending to be ok just to keep the peace. I dont want to have another conversation with him about this because he will say he is here for me, and I can talk to him and just kind of gaslight me or make me feel like Im being silly or that he will change. Why cant I see through it all in the moment? When we talk, when I hear his voice, Im washed over with warmth and love but I still feel this deep loneliness. I feel like I am in internal turmoil because I love this man but I dont know why I want to stay even though he is emotionally and physically unavailable. We dont do anything. We barely talk. Even our sexual preferences are different. But I love him. He isnt a bad person. Right now I am painting him in this negative light only because I feel hurt. He has his good qualities just like any other person. I just dont know what to do I know we need to break up, but everytime I think about doing it, I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like my body is under attack and I start to panic. I believe that is due to my previous relationships ending so traumatically one would attempt to end his life anytime I tried to leave and the other hated me so much by the end of it they wanted to burn me to the ground. Im mentally unstable, I stubble with severe depression, I have self image issues, I have low self esteem and struggle to keep my head straight. Im flawed Im sorry this is all over the place. I want to be honest and clear that we both are imperfect. He isnt a villain. I want to leave but it breaks my heart to know that I will be the reason he hurts. Or maybe he wont.",

    "title": "Is it normal that my 25F bf 29M doesnt buy me anything?",
    "text": "My 25F love language is gift-giving. Its how I show love and it comes naturally to me. Even when I dont have much, I still find ways to make the people I care about feel special. Im unemployed right now, but that hasnt stopped me from putting effort, thought, and whatever money I can spare into meaningful gifts for my boyfriend 29M. He knows this about me and he definitely enjoys receiving. But what hurts is that he never really gives back in the same way. Not even close. I dont expect expensive things. I dont need grand gestures. I just want to feel like he thinks about me the way I think about him and that he notices the little things, that he cares enough to try. But Im starting to feel like Im the only one in this relationship who actually goes out of my way to make the other person feel seen. Were long distance, so I try to close that gap with effort. Whether thats sending gifts for special occasions or no occasion at all, styling him, shopping for him, remembering everything he says he likes or wants and I love doing those things. But the lack of reciprocity is starting to feel less like a difference in love languages and more like he just doesnt care as much. There was one visit where we spent six hours shopping for him I helped him pick out all his clothes like I always do. And the whole time, he didnt once ask me if I wanted or needed anything. This was right before my graduation, which he knew meant a lot to me, and hed promised to get me something for it. He never did. For Christmas, I gave him designer shoes, new clothes, and covered his annual gym membership. He said hed give me my gift the weekend after the holidays and then gave me a bottle of perfume that I had literally bought for myself in front of him. He had a full week to come up with something thoughtful, and still gave me something I neither needed nor wanted. Valentines Day? I shipped him a coffee machine in advance so it would arrive in time. It ended up making it there a day early. So he definitely knew that it was for valentines. He had an extra day to plan something or arrange to send me something. He gave me nothing. Not even flowers, something Ive told him multiple times would mean a lot to me. And anytime I bring it up, he makes me feel like Im being materialistic for wanting stupid things. I cant even remember if he texted me saying happy valentines For his birthday, I booked a weekend getaway, decorated the hotel, paid for everything, and spoiled him the whole time. For mine? I said I just wanted to spend the day together. He planned a double date with his friend and his friends girlfriend even after I asked multiple times for it to just be us. Im not looking to keep score. But when someone knows exactly how much effort you put in and they still choose to do the bare minimum, it just starts to feel really lonely. Like Im constantly pouring into someone who doesnt even try to refill the cup. I dont know. Im just feeling kind of hollow about it lately. Has anyone else gone through something like this? Am I the problem?",

    "text": "Hey Reddit back again with a stupid question. Ive been in two real relationships and Im 20 years old. I was with my ex for a year even though he hit me and cheated on me all the time. I dont know why I stayed or even why I still think about him sometimes, about why he did what he did and how we mightve been different if he hadnt. Ive been really struggling with my current boyfriend. In February, I dont really know what changed but my boyfriend started getting in my face. Just pushing and pinning nothing too bad, but as of this last month its been getting a lot worse. Last weekend he really hurt me, bite me, hit me, pinned me, choked me. I know Im stupid for even considering staying but literally a day later Im snooping through his phone which I dont usually do unlike with my ex cause after I caught him cheating once I found out the more I looked the more I found and he wrote me a note in his notes. Telling me how he sexted with this girl a month back and he felt terrible about it. I confronted him were still together cause Im a moron but thats not the issue Im having. I mean its an issue but not the one I want to address. I dont remember when it was but he once told me that Im the reason he does it, not cheating but hurting me. That hes never done it before and my ex hadnt either which he knows and I know for fact cause I texted his ex after we broke up trying to build a case against him which is a whole other story so I must be the problem. He said I drive people crazy, my friends, my family, and especially my boyfriend. That any boyfriends after him will ultimately end up hurting me too because I make them. Theres something in me that drives people insane and makes them want to hurt me. Is there any thing I could be doing? I just dont understand. Im a really good girlfriend. I celebrate every holiday I spend hundreds of dollars on thoughtful gifts and presents. I plan dates, I have sex regularly including oral. I pay for most things. Im always doing something sweet or thoughtful always thinking of them. My current boyfriend loves stuffed animals and Ive bought so many for him I have to contain myself at the store cause there just isnt room lol I just dont understand what Im doing wrong to make them hate me so much.",

    "text": "Me 25F and my boyfriend 27M have been together going on 4 years. We are very happy and have never had any huge problems in our relationship. When we met he had recently been overseas for work and had picked up a habit of using chewing tobacco every day but this switched to nicotine vapes once he come back to our home country. I also vaped when we met because I was an ex tobacco and marijuana smoker. About a year into our relationship we came to an agreement that we would both quit smoking vapes because of financial and health reasons. I thought it would be easier if we did it together also. I followed through on my end and over the course of a few months managed to kick the habit. It also seemed liked he had quit for the most part also. However I soon found out that he was still smoking at work and hiding it from me , when I asked him about it he said that because of how stressful work is he needs it and he is also constantly around smokers all day so he had been unable to willpower his way into quitting. Fast forward a couple years later and he is still vaping except now he doesnt hide it from me. I have tried to compromise with him, saying if he is going to continue then he should at least not do it at home because he claims the nicotine helps with work stress. If he is relaxing at home why does he need to use it. This worked for a while but he has gone back to his old habits of using it all the time. For the record , I dont care about him using nicotine products like mints or patches, I just dont like the health concerns of vaping and thats why Im upset he continued. If we switched to something he did not inhale into his lungs I wouldnt care. Am I justified in being mad about this? Its not like having the vape around me makes me likely to start the habit again, I hate the taste of them now so its not an issue in that way for me. I understand that it is his body and he is allowed to make his own choices but I also feel that he should respect my wishes to some degree and at least make some sort of effort to uphold our agreement and try to quit. What would you guys do in my situation? I think I need some perspective on this.",

    "text": "Location: Arizona Hello, I have a lease I signed on tonight electronically, 5/15/2025, but after considering it, I dont know if I want to move forward. I havent gotten the keys yet, that happens tomorrow in person during the walk-through inspection. I wanted to see if I could void or not be responsible for this lease before the hand-over of possession of property, in the lease it states: 2. TERM. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on 05/16/2025 and continue through 05/31/2026 this ending date of the lease shall be referred to as the initial termination date. If either party chooses to terminate this agreement at the end of the lease term initial termination date that party must deliver to the other party a written notice of intent to vacate or terminate no less than thirty 30 days prior to the initial termination date of the tenancy. Otherwise, the lease terms shall continue thereafter, after the initial lease termination date on a month-to-month basis without further notice, until one party provides the other party a written, periodic full monthly period, thirty 30 day notice of intent to vacate. 2.1 If the Landlord, for any reason, cannot deliver possession of premises to the Resident at the commencement of lease term, as hereinabove specified, this Agreement shall not be void or voidable, and shall not abate, nor shall the Landlord be liable to the Resident for any loss or damages resulting therefrom. In such event, Residents only damage shall be a prorated deduction of rent, or an abatement of the rent, covering the period between commencement of said term and the time when the Landlord can deliver possession. The lease shall otherwise remain enforceable. Does this just mean that I would be liable for 1 day of prorated rent if I decide to cancel before the delivered possession of the premises, aka the key handover?",

    "text": "Problem/Goal: I want help/clarity regarding my situation. I am a resident physician as well, working 36-72 hr shifts and this has honestly taken a toll on me Context: Two years ago, I met my girlfriend through Facebook. We chatted for around three months, getting to know each other. During that time, I told her about my previous relationships. I had twoboth were situationshipsand I had sexual experiences in both. On the other hand, my girlfriend claims she is a virgin. However, throughout our relationship, she has constantly judged me and reminded me of how dirty I was and how wrong I was for my past experiences. I genuinely tried to listen to her and reassured her multiple times that it was all in the past, and that I am fully devoted to her now. Despite this, she frequently says things like, I can never overcome your past. This issue has come up repeatedly in our relationship. She sometimes tells me shes gotten over it, but whenever shes triggered, it leads to conflict. She tells me her flings were better, that her ex wouldve been a better choice, etc. Ive been trying very hard to understand her and be as patient as I can. But Ive reached a point where I end up shouting out of frustration over her constant pettiness regarding my past. A few days ago, she brought up a story about someone I had communicated with three years ago. She told me that person was involved in a scandal. Then she said she was glad I chose her. I replied, I love you and thats why I chose you. For some reason, this made her angry. She then said things like, Youre the same as that person slut, It wouldve been better if I chose person A, and I could NEVER accept your past. After that, I went to her house and tried to calm her down. She once again promised that she would change and that a therapist would help her a promise she has made several times before. Previous Attempts: I accepted that maybe my past has caused her some distress. However, I told her its not fair or rational to keep blaming me for things I cant controlespecially events that happened before we met.",

    "title": "Can I alter this landlord tenet agreement.UT",
    "text": "Location: Utah I am a Host Home foster but an adult. The company that I am an independent contractor for recently sent me a lease agreement that they want me and the person who lives in my house to sign. He has lived with me for six years and this is the first time they are making us sign such an agreement. They have listed their rent as 624.75 but that is not just rent, it is room and board. I asked them to change it to reflect room and board and they emailed me back a breakdown of the 624.75 payment. I then said I would sign the agreement once they changed it to reflect the breakdown of the costs. That was when I was told they cannot do that as it was written by a lawyer. This makes no sense to me but I am thinking I can just cross out and change it myself and then sign the altered document. I cannot seem to be able to post a picture of the agreement but here are the two paragraphs I think apply to my issue. 4. Lease Term and Monthly Rent. The term of this Lease shall be for one 1 year, beginning on January 1, 2025 and ending on December 31, 2025. The Tenant agrees to pay the Landlord rent in the amount of 624.75 per month for the term of the Lease. 14. Modification of Amendment. This Lease may not be amended or modified, nor may any right or obligation hereunder be waived orally, and no such amendment or modification shall be effective for any purpose unless it is in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement thereof is sought. I am wanting to do this as I believe that I might have to start to put this on my taxes since it is now listed as rent. FYI: when you foster a client you do not pay any taxes on the income they give you per state law. I literally do not get a I099 or W-9. What do you think about my issue? Can I amend the document then have us both sign it?",

    "title": "Job is keeping Accumulated Sick Time hidden away from employees? Location: NY",
    "text": "Location: New York State Previously, for all people in our positon, our unused Sick Time was rolled over to the next year. To be clear, I am NOT talking about Vacation or Personal time, only Sick time. Recently, they have changed our policy. Now, our sick time still rolls over, however, when viewed online, it is now in a seperate file. NYS Sick vs NYS Excess. The rollover time in the Excess file is NOT accessable. Not now, not later, not in an emergency, NEVER. We have brought this change up in several work meetings. Our bosses have no answers. We asked if we could apply somehow to access this time. We cannot. We asked if we could access it in a medical emergency, we cannot. There is, according to our immediate supervisors, NO way, under ANY circumstances, to access or use this time. Yet, it is recorded yearly and available to view on each individual employee profile. It is not just time lost as dictated by the employer. They are still keeping track of this time and keeping the number accessable to the employee. We dont care if the company policy has changed to cause employees to lose yearly sick time although its a crappy move. Were just confused about why this time isnt being LOST, it seems to be being held in limbo, still recorded and accounted for, yet away from any access to employees. We have asked several times for our supervisors/HR/anybody to come to a site meeting to explain why this change was made. First, we were advised that they were thinking about it. Then, they missed two meetings where they promised to come and clarify the issue. Now, we are told they we company is in discussions with it lawyers about it. It has now been 5 months since we demanded clarifications about the issue, and 3 months since we were told the lawyers were in talks about it. I understand this is vague, but this is the only info the employee have been given. Does anyone have any insight on the possible problem? Why has it taken over 5 months to answer this? Why are lawyers involved?",

    "text": "This past week has been extremely stressful. My dad is in the hospital, and Im the only one taking care of him. On top of that, its finals week at school, so Im juggling a lot mentally and emotionally. Throughout everything, my boyfriend has shown little to no care. He hasnt checked in on me, hasnt offered help, or even just emotional support. Today, I had an emergency and needed to call my aunt, but I didnt have any load credits on my phone. I asked my boyfriend if he could help me out. Instead of helping, he just said a bunch of vague stuff that didnt actually offer a solution. Thankfully, a stranger helped me instead. I texted my boyfriend after that and said, Never mind, I just needed a bit of help but its fine now. And his response? Okay, Im just gonna rest here. That was it. Im exhausted, overwhelmed, and honestly, heartbroken that someone who claims to care about me couldnt even be there for me in a moment of real need. Im seriously considering breaking up with him because I feel like Im in this relationship alone.",

    "text": "Location: Wisconsin Hi, I got a non-moving citation in Wisconsin yesterday for expired registration. The ticket says I dont have to show up to court, but I plan on going anyway because Id really like to try to get it dismissed. The officer who gave me the ticket was really respectful and cool about it. My registration had been expired for six months, and I fully understand that I shouldve stayed on top of itbut Ive had a lot going on with school and work. Ive never had any prior run-ins with the law. Is there a better way I should be going about this, or anything I should expect when I show up to court?",

    "text": "This is going to be a bit of a long one so brace yourselves Im at a crossroads with my boyfriend. For context, weve been together for a year now and have always been long-distance about a 2/3hour car ride away. At the beginning, seeing each other was a lot easier because my boyfriend was on holidays so he had the time to come see me basically whenever we wanted. With time however, this has become more difficult due to work commitments etc. So normally we would see each other maybe once every two weeks. Recently however weve been seeing each other once a month and I mean for literally a day. Im finding this really tough but I honestly feel like it doesnt affect my bf. Hes a lot more of the loner type than me, but hes always been a bit emotionally distant and its something weve already talked about, and he said he would put in more effort. But I always seem to be the one saying when are we seeing each other next time? because he doesnt seem to think about it. This makes me feel like Im the only one who is invested in the relationship. And when we do settle on a date, he doesnt seem to be excited or anything, it just seems like hes doing it to make me happy. Ive also started thinking long-term, and Im aware that for at least the next couple of years we will be long-distance, which is honestly depressing to me. I think that he lacks attentiveness towards me, not always but quite often. For example, I had a very painful period once so I took a day off from work, and when I told him this he didnt really show me much empathy or seem to care that much about it. I do want to add that my bf does have many qualities and he does treat me well, I just feel so alone in our relationship sometimes and I dont know what to do. Anyways, Ill stop now but my question is what can I do to remedy this, seeing as Ive already talked about this with him once before ?",

    "text": "Hi everyone, Ive 28f been with my boyfriend 39m for a bit now, but from the very beginning, hes always been pretty distant. Even on our first date, he didnt really open up much. Over time, Ive realized we dont share the same spark or energy, and its left me feeling lonely and disconnected. I was in a tough living situation before, so when I met him, I was desperate to get out and didnt think much about the long-term compatibility. Now that Im out, Im starting to see that what I want and need might be very different from what hes able to give. When I try to talk to him about it, he says things like Were fine, tired and just worried about you, which feels dismissive and like hes shutting down real conversations. Ive expressed my needs, but I dont feel like theyre being met. Financially, Im stuck right now, which makes it hard to consider leaving, but emotionally, Im feeling drained and unsure if this relationship is right for me. I also recently met someone new who seems really compatible with me, and its made me question whether I should even be trying to fix things with my current partner. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you decide when its time to stay and work through things, and when its time to - let go? Thanks for any advice or perspective.",

Years have passed and Ive experieneced all sorts of negative side effects. From vagal syncope, to strokes as far as Im aware. Fatigue to just straight up weakness. Im tired of dealing with double vision facial pain, pressure on the back of my head. At any given moment, my neck could get cruxed into a position like it is at this very moment, that feels like its causing brain damage i feel like my brain cant breathe as well sometimes. Ive been waiting for a scan for almost a year now so i think that doctor is dead. I cant go to the ER because they always spit me back out and tell me that its in my head. What kind of doctor do I go to? How can i ensure i get healed, i also dont have health insurance anymore but i dont mind having debt that Im not going to pay so that doesnt scare me. Also, any advice for the mean tome when im just trying to straighten out my neck and relieve the pressure without hurting myself would be nice!",

Because her loans give her extra cash, she thinks she has money to spend and is spending a crap ton of money on different trips and using it to pay off her debt.

    "text": "Location: Johnson County, Kansas I received a citation for furnishing a minor with an alcoholic or malt beverage for context: this was a controlled buy retail situation - and it was an accident, so no, I do not have a habit of furnishing minors, willfully or otherwise. First offense. as in: first criminal offense /ever/. I do not feel as though my attorney is advocating for me. I hired a local firm my attorney is pushing pretty hard for diversion and basically shutting down my requests for alternatives. Thing is, all theyve done is call me downtown to their office to fill out paperwork that I saw prosecutors handing to other defendants in the court room. I know I could have filed this paperwork myself, and I knew this before hiring the attorney but believed that legal counsel would give me some better options than probation lite for a year. Considering this is my first offense, and the circumstances of the incident, I was previously under the impression that I might obtain a dismissal or other resolution, through lesser means, with the help of an attorney. The way my lawyer outlined it, my options are as follows: 1. Go to trial I will lose. 2. Apply for diversion, which will include a year of random drug/alcohol tests, check-ins with a probation officer, rehabilitative classes, and community service. 3. Take a plea deal, which will include a year of actual probation and, according to my attorney, potentially be somehow worse than the diversion PLUS, of course, include the criminal conviction. Am I missing something? Am I completely delusional for thinking that an attorney could help make this situation any better? I have felt totally brushed off and received a series of shrugs and ah well thats how the system works as an answer from my attorney. Is that true? Is every instance in Johnson County of furnishing a minor met with such stringent and harsh rules, or is my attorney basically taking 2k to be a glorified file clerk???",

    "text": "So we are in our late 20s and live in LA. When she was in college, she was in a sorority, but my parents wouldnt let me join a fraternity. My college experience sucked donkey sausage, like Donkey from Shrek. Anyway, she got invited to a Hollywood party and wants me to come along. I said absolutely not. If you didnt get to go to frat/sorWHORity parties in college, whats the point of going to other parties later? College Greek parties are the pinnacle of parties. I know many people disagree with me, but from my point of view, a consolation prize is worth less than nothing. I dont want to go. I didnt get to go to fun aka frat/sorWHORity parties back then, why would I want to go to a lesser party now? I missed out on the best parties And so now I dont want to go to some second rate parties. I choose to stay away from parties all together and do what I usually do when the scars of the past start hurting again - drink myself to sleep, alone. Im not even telling her she cant go. Id rather she didnt go, but Im letting her go because I know it means a lot to her. However, if shed rather I go but I dont want to, I shouldnt be compelled to go, just like Id rather she not go but she wants to, so it would be wrong for me to compel her to not go. How do I get her to stop trying to pressure me into going?",

    "text": "Like the title says, Ill probably need to cut ties with her soon.not because I want to, but because Ill be moving abroad like 10k kilometers abroad type shit in august and I dont think Ill ever move back after that. For context, weve known each other for all 3 years of high school and weve literally been everything you can ever be with someone. Weve hated each other, hooked up, dated some time, broke up, ghosted ourselves, gone back to friends, etc, etc. we stopped talking to each other for a while because like I just said, we dated twice, but somehow, life circumstances, luck?, and stuff in general have always found a way to bring us back together. Today, we are really good friends, we love each other as friends obv, although I believe a little bit of the other feelings have lingered on me and honestly, I wouldnt have it any other way. Her whole family also loves me, my family loves her, its like weve formed I dont want to say it like that but I cant think of a synonym rn a very family-esque relationship. Now that weve knocked all the context out of the way, heres the deal: today, she now has a bfunknown, maybe 19? that doesnt really like her having male friends for some reason, which I respect and as long as shes happy, Im honestly not complaining one bit. But now, in a bit less than a month, shell go work at a summer camp in the US and shell be back until august around the time Ill also have to start packing/leave. That means that Ill probably see her again once or twice since at that point, fuck the boyfriend, I need closure and I need to say goodbye to everyone since they all have been awesome with me. Honestly, I dont know how to deal with that. As you can see, weve been trough a metric fuck-ton of stuff together. Weve both been there for each other trough the good, the bad, the ugly, and the fucking worst. After I leave, well obviously end up having separate lives, grow up and shit, but honestly i dont know how to manage leaving someone that has been a fundamental part of my life for me family is moving out with me a year later so not counting them as leaving. More so because Ill leave having seeing her at most twice for the rest of the year when we had spent pretty much August trough March-April pretty much glued together. We spent an awesome time traveling trough Mexico with our friend group, went to every single one of her brothers games, etc, etc. it just feels like.its going to leave a whole in me for a while.. So yeah, kind of looking for advice into how to deal with this and most importantly, how to find a good side to this or at least, find the closure I want/need.",

It also bothers me even more because this guy brags about how he is the highest paid in the company when I see him lounging around, chatting to people while making big mistakes at contract award stage which I get stuck with during the project stage as PM while he admits none of the responsibility. I maintain minimal interface with this guy and dont actively report to him except when theres risk or a budget to approve, however, I want to also politely make him understand that he cant ask me to print a hard copy of a document that is his job to review and approve with his boss.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I arent a good match. We fell in love when I was going through a really dark place. He became my safe place, but now, I feel more alone than ever. I have so many problems that weigh on me heavily and is completely avoidant of any of it. He tells me I can talk with him, but when I do, he talks over me, avoids the conversation, or he will listen but I can tell he really doesnt want to hear it. He has every right to protect his peace, but I feel so deeply alone, it breaks my soul. Im really going through a hard time, it feels like Im always going through a hard time because problems just keep coming. Ive lost interest in conversation with him because whats the point? If he cant be present for me at my worst, I really dont want to pretend to be happy for his sake. Im tired of pretending to be ok just to keep the peace. I dont want to have another conversation with him about this because he will say he is here for me, and I can talk to him and just kind of gaslight me or make me feel like Im being silly or that he will change. Why cant I see through it all in the moment? When we talk, when I hear his voice, Im washed over with warmth and love but I still feel this deep loneliness. I feel like I am in internal turmoil because I love this man but I dont know why I want to stay even though he is emotionally and physically unavailable. We dont do anything. We barely talk. Even our sexual preferences are different. But I love him. He isnt a bad person. Right now I am painting him in this negative light only because I feel hurt. He has his good qualities just like any other person. I just dont know what to do I know we need to break up, but everytime I think about doing it, I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like my body is under attack and I start to panic. I believe that is due to my previous relationships ending so traumatically one would attempt to end his life anytime I tried to leave and the other hated me so much by the end of it they wanted to burn me to the ground. Im mentally unstable, I stubble with severe depression, I have self image issues, I have low self esteem and struggle to keep my head straight. Im flawed Im sorry this is all over the place. I want to be honest and clear that we both are imperfect. He isnt a villain. I want to leave but it breaks my heart to know that I will be the reason he hurts. Or maybe he wont.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, our apartment hired a third party to install ceiling fans in our bedrooms. They ended up leaving shards of glass everywhere in my room, likely from a broken lightbulb that I found left behind on my sink counter. They also left plaster and trash everywhere around the apartment and our rooms. My roommates and I cleaned up the mess ourselves, then talked to the leasing office. We were only given a verbal apology and 25 gift cards each. Today I was cleaning my room, when I noticed a nail under my bed. When I reached to pick it up, I also saw something shiny, but I thought I picked up all the glass before so I didnt think much of it. I reached for it and it turned out to be glass and it ended up stabbing pretty deep into my finger, causing blood to go everywhere. My roommates and I spent another hour cleaning up the blood but Im honestly still scared to go into my room in case theres still glass. I think theres still blood in the carpet. I am also worried because we have a cat that loves to go under my bed - shes been there frequently these past few weeks and Im just glad she wasnt hurt. We feel like they didnt properly follow up with us the first time, as they didnt send anyone to inspect to see if the glass and debris had been cleaned up. We dont really know how to go about this since they have already given us 25 gift cards the first time we talked to them for the inconvenience of having to clean everything up. Now that there is an injury, is there anything we can do? Should we talk to the leasing office immediately? Should we get someone to represent us? We dont know much about the law and are worried if we go to the leasing office well say something wrong or they will just dismiss us like they did the first time. Location: Seattle, Washington.",

    "text": "Hello. To clarify, this is my first romantic relationship with a boy so neither of us have any idea what we are doing and are trying to learn. I actually broke up with him in January but after having time away from each other we wanted to try and make things work out again since we both because genuinely I think hes a really sweet person. But the reasons why I broke up with him in the first place keep repeating and its not like I dont tell him how what he does hurt me. I am pretty open about boundaries. And yeah I know I am not in a relationship with him anymore, but if we both want to make things work out then he needs to try harder and do better. Its like he doesnt learn from what I tell him and I feel Ive allowed it to slide too many times. I think hes dense. I need space away from him, idk how long, maybe forever idk. However, I am really scared he is going to do something stupid and risky or harm himself. Im terrified of it. And no, he doesnt threaten me to do any of that if I leave for good. But we both dont have the greatest mental health and I fear if I am not there to support him hes just gonna spiral. And yea I know im not his mom but it doesnt stop me from worrying about him. I still really love him but my mental health needs to come first. Why are relationships so hard Any advice on how I can manage this situation better? How can I step away from this relationship for a moment without having that fear? I dont want him gone from my life forever but I also dont want the cycle to repeat. tldr: my ex and I really wanted to try and make things work out. They arent working. I gotta step away for my own sanity, scared he may do something risky and harm himself.",

    "text": "Location: Upstate New York I was terminated on November 11, 2024the day after returning from maternity leave-due to an alleged violation of company policy. Prior to this, I held the position of coach/ trainer within my department and had a strong employment record. I did not miss a single day of work during my pregnancy outside of scheduled medical appointments, which were properly documented and covered using paid time. I had no disciplinary history and was active in several in-store committees focused on employee satisfaction and safety. I was also recognized as the top-selling associate across my division out of 802 stores, receiving an Executive Award from the divisions President in person. I was never made aware of any investigation being conducted regarding a policy violation. When I returned to work on November 11, I was unable to clock in due to a system delay following maternity leave and was instructed to use a paper time slip, which I completed. Later that day, I was called into a meeting with my store manager and asset protection representative to discuss the violation. The asset protection representative indicated that, based on my explanation, they did not expert termination to be the outcome. I was sent back to the floor to continue working, but was later called back in and informed of my termination. At that time, I submitted my time slip to my store manager for the hours I had worked that day. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the matter-via corporate on January 31 and April 2, 2025, and my former store HR rep on April 3, 2025 I have yet to receive payment. My pay stub for the week of November 11-17, 2024, reflects a payment of 0. Ive been trying to do my own research and according to New York Labor Law, I should have received my final wages by the next regularly scheduled payday, which would have been November 22, 2024. As of today, I have still not been paid. It is now a single income household and my husband is doing everything he can, but we dont have the funds to afford a lawyer right now. I reached out to The Legal Aid Society to see if I would be eligible for pro bono because I feel like a lawsuit needs to be filed and I need to receive liquidated damages due to my pay not being received. I had a call scheduled for May 14th and havent heard from that law office. I even reached out twice to the contact information they provided me when scheduling this call to discuss my eligibility and havent gotten a response. What do I do? Im so lost because Im owed money and have tried seeking representation and now still havent received my final paycheck AND Ive been ghosted by an attorney.",

    "text": "Married and moved in since December of 2024. I have a lot of kids my husband has 2 they stay with us bi weekly on the weekends. Two of my kids live with us and our 2 year old. Prior to marriage we lived separately. We came together all of us sometimes over the 5 years of our relationship. And things where good. Last year towards the holidays my apartment flooded with sewage ruining almost everything I owned, and most of the things I had left my husband said to get rid of. He bought a sectional similar to mine just smaller and said I should get rid of mine. Told me to get rid of the bunk beds hed buy other ones. So through getting a place he was using his money his credit cards cause I was already low in money due to being out of work frequently with our daughters health, and mine after the flooding. Living together I get paid once a month I pay half of the bills including the credit cards the new things where bought on and the couch. I buy groceries and what we need with the rest of what I have. Lately I do have to ask for money to get gas before my next paycheck. On another note:We have to deal with our respective exes starting arguments with is via text, his kids mother calls cps and the cops on us, tells the kids that my kids take all their things, not to eat what I cook, to hide and take pictures of us. My ex has it in his mind that we take road trips to Mexico with my kids. And we are on a fast track to get deported. My oldest son is in a behavioral treatment center. My grandmother just died. With that my mother came into town after not seeing or speaking to her since 2019. We are dealing with a lot, I am dealing with a lot and my husband has continuously started arguments with me because I look sad, or tired, that buying me things doesnt make those things go away. And when the arguments happen he says the most hurtful things he can think of and then leads to counting all the money spent and telling me I need to pay him back. Tonight an argument happened he asked why Im in the apartment ,said he was going to put in the required 60 day notice and I needed to pay him my half of the bills for that time frame and half of the 7,000. To break the lease. That I needed to pay him on the first or leave by then. That everything is his and he will be moving it out within the next week. Told me that his kids call me a demon and an evil person. That his ex wife is better than me. I have no place to go with my kids but I have to find something somewhere. We will be left with basically nothing but each other, and our cloths. I hate that because of my decision to get married and how everything happened that my children have to suffer. He doesnt even really care about our daughter or understand that she has delays in development. He uses her against me. Saying she can live without me, he will hire a nanny. That I dont want to be a mom anyway and I dont love her like my other children. All I do is for each of the kids, I took a step back from his kids because he wanted me to. I work with kids and adults with developmental issues. I would be a horrible mom to not love her and give care to my clients the way I do. Im at a loss and completely broken with how the past few months have gone it is good when it is good but the bad times are breaking who I am. I have no place to go and limited money. I have no reliable family. And at this point I dont know what he will do to make sure I have nothing including my children.",

    "title": "Women of reddit, pls give me advice. Is this manipulation or is it my OCD?",
    "text": "24F here. I suffer from very severe OCD. I have been suffering since 2011. I have had multiple themes. So, I recently got into a relationship 1.1 years ago. Hes my first boyfriend. Smart, cute, very high EQ. Now, before we started dating, I had this criteria that I would only have sex after marriage. I thought I would do anything below the waist after marriage. So, when we started talking only, we kicked it off very, very well. And I didnt wait for long before telling him that I didnt want to have any kind of sex before marriage. He was taken aback. I told him that if it was a dealbreaker for him, then we could end the relationship since we were barely talking for a week or something. He said that it wasnt a dealbreaker but that he couldnt promise for the future. We used to have multiple conversations about what stuff is on the table and what isnt. I really liked him and he really, really liked me. So, while the right thing to do was to move on, we didnt want to let go. One day, however, he got annoyed and said that a relationship is about compromise and if hes going to compromise, then even I must keep an open mind. I found that red-flaggy, so I called him out and he accepted that I cant be expected to compromise on my values, and that too so early in a relationship. Then, well slowly slowly on the side I started keeping an open mind about other stuff like manual sex. Basically, I had these very elaborate timelinesthat Ill only let him touch my boobs by 1 year, etc. etc. I used to talk in these timelines and he didnt like it. He didnt like giving timelines to stuff, which is understandable. Anyway, the main reason why I didnt want to have sex before marriage was because my family put a lot of guilt inside me, and my OCD would make me confess it to my parents if I did it and that would make them hate me. Anyway, I talked to my mom and kind of indirectly got her permission to expand my boundaries. And then only I got okay with the idea of manual sex. But basically, I went through all this trouble because he wanted it. No, he didnt actively pressure me, but he used to send me memes and stuff about sex. I used to feel like Im being a bad girlfriend. On the side, we started doing stuff online... but that also took a little persuasion on his side. But mostly it was just him expressing his desire and me listening and then willing to go ahead. Sometimes I was uncomfortable and he asked me to stop but I only wanted to continue. I eventually got comfortable with it fully. Okay, fast forward 1.1 years, we did end up having sex. It took lots of breaking of mental blocks and lots of communication and a therapist too. At the beginning of the relationship, he did try to push my boundaries and he kind of succeeded in getting me to be comfortable with third base before marriage. However, we did it only when I felt like I wanted to. And even sex we did when I asked for it. Actually, I asked 3 months ago but he rejected and we went ahead now. However, what Im worrying about is whether him sending me memes and all those long conversations was good communication or was it coercion. He was allowed to express his desire, right? I felt pressure but I didnt feel manipulated by him. I did extend my boundaries for him but I dont know. Just adding this from my previous post. I dont know if its OCD thinking or if I should genuinely feel this way but I kept looking back at incidents in our relationship and thought that its sexual assault, and once the thought came into my head it played on loop. Little background: when we started dating, I told him that I would not want to have sex before marriage, so that was a source of conversation for long. We both kept contemplating whether we should continue the relationship or not. We are in a long-distance relationship. Were 24. Its our first relationship. --- 1. Incident 1: I look back at our conversations where he tried to initiate online sex stuff. It was mostly done very decently but sometimes his frustration would show, although I know he was trying hard not to. I would notice the change in tone and start overthinking and force a discussion out of him. He would tell me how he feels like its getting monotonous, how everyone has intimacy and how maybe I could start sending pictures to keep the fire burning so that we dont get bored. Valid, right? I heard him out and we did try this stuff and while I felt very awkward, I actually enjoy it a lot now. Yes, there were times when he asked too many times but I honestly didnt mind it or didnt find it coercive. But according to the internet, is it coercive, right? --- 2. Incident 2: We were making out in a room and I let us go to second base. We were making out for hours and his hand would periodically go between my legs and I would have to redirect it and say no. I would say sorry, no and he didnt like me saying sorry. Yes, I did say no multiple times but I know that things happen in the heat of the moment and I didnt feel uncomfortable or unsafe with him. --- 3. Incident 3: When we started dating, he would send me these NSFW memes which would scare me because I felt pressured but then eventually that stopped. I thank him for the memes because that made me open up to him as well. I never told him I was uncomfortable. So how is he to blame? --- 4. Incident 4: He once asked if he could finger me above my pants to which I said yes. This happened months ago. And one time, he was fingering me above my pants but it wasnt working out for either of us. He asked if he could do it under my pants and above my underwear but I didnt want that at first. Then he made some valid points which convinced me but I still kept saying no because I didnt want my brain to think oh no he coerced you into doing something. But then his eyes started watering and he said, I let you touch me, something something, so I said, Im not comfortable with this right now, you can ask me again later. Which he did and then only I said yes. He told me the tears happened at the wrong time and he sees which it might come out as emotionally manipulative but he cried because his grandmother had died the previous day. I didnt feel coerced but now my brain started thinking oh but he cried so its assault. --- 5. Incident 5: Whenever I rejected him, I could sense some tension. Now my brain thinks that it was emotional manipulation. He said it was all unintentional and he asked me to share these incidents with my friends and therapist to see what they say. I myself didnt feel violated but I only felt annoyed when these things happened because I was like oh shit now my OCD will overthink this. Help : What do you think? He did say some rude stuff very rarely like everyone does it, itll be difficult to find a guy who isnt into sex, were dating, how can there be no intimacy .. but he never said I owed it to him or was a bad gf for the same. --- Also, he once asked me to take off my bra on video call and I said no multiple times but then I was like okay youre going to have to seduce me. Which he did. And so I showed him. Is that consensual? Also, once he begged to see my face which I was showing but I was also saying Im not comfortable and he was still asking. Later I said I wasnt comfy and he said he didnt hear it. Tbh it was over video call. 24F. I have very severe OCD. I had told my boyfriend that I didnt want to have sex before marriage. He said it might become a problem for him at some point. I said maybe with time my views might change. We were making out. I gave him a handjob for the first time. He asked if he could finger me above my pants I was wearing thin shorts. I said okay. We tried. It failed. Then he asked if he could do it below my pants but above my underwear since we couldnt feel anything. I said no. He tried to finger me above my pants again. Failed again. Asked again, I said no. This happened a few times. At one point his eyes started watering and he said that he felt used because he let me touch him but I wasnt letting him pleasure me. I said Im not comfortable so if that means I shouldnt touch him, I wont. He asked again. I said no, not right now, but you can ask me after some time, Ill think about it. He asked after some time. I allowed. I enjoyed. We did round two also. Went home. Felt guilty and disgusted because a boy touched me down there. Now little back story: The previous date, my boyfriend had asked me something more than once and I said no, sorry. He said, Please dont say sorry, its okay. And then later I brought it up that if he asks many times then my head starts thinking omg what if hes coercing me, what if I say yes and this is assault. So he told me Okay, sometimes when Im horny I might not process your no, so you can keep saying no and I wont feel bad. Please dont feel pressured. Now when the next incident happened, when he asked me more than once, in my head I thought omg now even if I want to give in, my head will think it was assault so Ill have to say no. So thats why I told him to ask me after some time. Also later he told me the crying wasnt to guilt me I didnt feel guilty about it but it was because his grandmother had passed away the previous day. My friends and therapist dont think its coercive at all. Please note nothing of this sort has happened since I communicated that I dont like him pushing my boundaries. He has been more mindful its been 8 months now. We have a safe word. He doesnt ask more than once. Its going awesome. --- What about that incident where he would periodically try to finger me while making out and I would have to say nope and he would take his hand out? We were making out for 5 hours and his hands would do this once in a while above my jeans. Only one time he was touching my butt and I said dont go further down but his hand did go to finger me and I said stop and he took it out and we continued making out. Is this assault? --- This stuff.",

    "text": "Hi, Im trying to keep this brief. I met my 54M partner 54F 5 years ago and its mostly been like a fairy tale. When we go out, travel, chill out or eat, things are great. Shes lovely, really happy, supportive, beautiful. Love of my life. But, she has anxiety and PTSD from being cheated on in previous relationships. She feels I am flirting every time I am with a client I work in media, WFH. I am not. I have no interest and no intention with anyone other than her. I am not a cheater, will never cheat. I am friendly and like to laugh and generally joke a bit, but I am not touchy with people and when I have a client here we are focusing on the job. There may be chat but nothing sexual or anything like that remotely. But my partner feels I am being overly friendly ?maybe but has accused me of flirting everytime. It makes it very difficult to do my job and I feel relieved if I have a client who is a man so this wont come up. Recently weve had another argument regarding my son whose 21st is coming up and a party is being organised by his mum, my ex. My son isnt ready to meet my partner yet and she isnt invited. This sucks but Im, rebuilding that relationship so want to give it time. Weve been arguing around this for a week. No the arguments often start as conversations but rapidly escalate into a shouting match. I cant get her to understand my perspective about any of these big issues. SHe would say the same of me. I want to go to counselling. She wont. Were on the point of ending it. Im so tired of these circular arguments, I feel relieved but if I look at our photos of good times I feel terribly sad. TLDR: If everything else has been so good, but we have these 2 big fundamental problems, how can we make this relationship work?",

    "title": "How Can I Recover From Being Exposed to Explicit Content in my Childhood?",
    "text": "I feel like my sexuality is completely messed up, like my brain is wired completely different because of my childhood, and I dont know what to really do. Its severely messed up. I dont feel normal at all, and Im ashamed to talk to a therapist about it. Im 18 now, so I feel like I can talk about this NSFW topic without making other adults uncomfortable. I really hope someone can offer me any advice. This is a trigger warning for anyone who doesnt want to read about exposure to pornography, possibly sexual abuse incestual implications, and severe domestic abuse among and against children. I advise the reader seriously because this is very sensitive and uncomfortable. What I say here might not be believable, and it might just be my memory issues, but please believe that everything I say is real. I dont know if this is a common experience, but my earliest memory was my parents having sex a few feet from me when I was a very small baby. I remember the curtains, the walls, the bed I was sleeping in, who was sleeping next to me, and so on, so I know that its real. I assume that I was a baby because they probably thought that I wouldnt recall it or that I was asleep. Then, I was first exposed to porn when I was 3 years old. These events all happened before my 4th birthday which I remembered that I got a princess cake for, so I know that my earliest memories began between when I was 1-3, and many of them were sexual or abusive. I dont have a lot of happy memories from that age, aside from the occasional happy family moments and then when I first went to preschool at 3. My childhood wasnt great, and I dont have a good overall recollection of it, but I prefer it that way because it was very traumatic for me. Im a very repressed person, and I dont know when Ill be able to unpack all of my trauma because its very painful for me to remember. My 2nd memory after the bedroom memory was my brother 12 drowning my sister 4/5 in the bathtub and forcing my 3 other siblings 7-11 to individually push her head in the water as well, but she didnt die. He was holding her head underwater long enough not to kill her and did it repeatedly. I remember that he grabbed my hand as a toddler and forced me to hold her head at some point too. At this time, I mustve been 3. Obviously, as a 3 year old, you dont have the actual strength to push anyones head down, so he was forcing it by putting his hand over mine to hold down my sister in the water. He wanted all of us to equally inflict harm. My younger sister was 1 at this time, so she wasnt involved in the initiation. I dont remember why my sister 4 was being hurt, but apparently, she was crying because she wanted to go shopping with my grandparents, and it pissed my brother off, so he began abusing her. I know that the way I talk about this directly seems too calm and strange, but the event has played over so many times in my head that I feel desensitized to it at this point. My family is bigger than the average family. I have 6 siblings, and I am the second youngest. My siblings and I are all very close in age. For reference, Im 18. My oldest brother is only 9 years older than me. My second oldest brother is 8 years older than me. My oldest sister is 7 years older than me. My older brother is 4 years older than me. My older sister the one who was abused in that memory is 2 years older than me. My younger sister is two years younger than me. My family comes from very conservative and ethnic values. Due to this, severe abuse was subjected to my father, especially as he grew up in the mountains and immigrated to California due to war. Throughout his childhood, whether he lived in the mountains, in refugee camps, or in California, he was repeatedly beaten with blunt objects and barbed electric wires. In the mountains and in refugee camps, theres not necessarily any police to stop child abuse, so this brutal form of abuse became normalized for him. As a result of the extreme abuse, my father became abusive toward his own children as well. I wasnt alive for the first 7-9 years of my oldest siblings lives, but they told me that they got the worst of it. My father repeatedly beat them, especially my oldest brother. To get you an idea of our family, we were the type of kids who showed up to school with multiple bruises and had CPS called on our family multiple times, but then CPS would just leave when everyone lied. There were at least 6 times that the schools had noticed the abuse and bruises on our bodies. When I was 6/7, my oldest sister punched me in the face so hard for being loud and left half of my face with a black eye, and my parents didnt notice for days because of how negligent they were. Until I was 10, the physical abuse began to stop because my oldest brother was 19, but there were occasional slaps and whippings when my father got very mad. For the most important years of my oldest brothers life, he was physically abused the worst, which is why, by the age of 12, he became extremely sadistic, abusive, and showed traits of sociopathy. My older siblings tell me that my brother wasnt always this way. He managed and coped with the abuse good and was very caring for a few years until one day, he returned from school and became a different person at 9 years old, like he had a different look in his eye. He inflicted severe abuse on the younger siblings and forced everyone to inflict abuse on each other too so that we wouldnt tell on each other. I dont know if anyone understands, but no one defied him or told on each other because when you grow up in an abusive state like this, it becomes something that you adapt to, and you become so deeply afraid of your abusers that you become complicit. If he decided to abuse one person, he made everyone abuse them too. If we didnt hurt them, we would get beaten up by him because he was the strongest physically and could beat multiple of us since we were all small children and literal toddlers. As we grew up and became more physically capable of overpowering him, we considered jumping him multiple times, but this power dynamic never leaves your mind when its been ingrained in your childhood like that. We were all scared of our oldest brother, even though he was only 12. The 11-year-old and 10-year-old couldnt stand up to him either. The point is that my father was abused, so he abused my oldest brother. My oldest brother abused my siblings and forced us to abuse each other. There were times my other siblings abused each other without direct influence under my brother, like my 11-year-old brother could beat my 7-year-old brother, and my 10-year-old sister would beat my 5-year-old sister. There was a system of hierarchy, and I wish that I could say I was never abusive, but I was extremely abusive, and I wont ever forgive myself for that. I was initiated into this cycle of abuse as a victim and perpetrator when I was 3, which was my 2nd memory after seeing my parents have sex. We were never sexually abused, but my oldest brother was also very messed up in the head sexually. He forced the two oldest siblings the 11 and 10 y/o to sleep naked next to each other multiple times to see if theyd have sex. When they didnt, he eventually stopped, but it messed my two oldest siblings the 10 and 11 y/o up very badly. I knew of it since I mustve been 3, so it messed me up too. By the age of 3, I saw my parents have sex, I knew that my oldest brother was forcing my other siblings to sleep naked to see if theyd have sex, and I was also exposed to pornography. One of my first times that I saw porn, I was actually reading comic porn with my sister, and we were laughing about it, but it was the first time that my genitals had physical sensation toward the content. It was definitely NOT toward my sister, but it was toward the content that we saw. By age 4, I began masturbating to pornography alone and since I was exposed to enough sexual content, I could use my own thoughts eventually. I dont think I knew that I was masturbating consciously, but I knew that it felt good whenever I touched it, but I also knew that it was something that I should do in private. From ages 4 to 7, I also slept in my parents bedroom. My dad slept in one bed, and I slept with my mom in a different bed. I dont know why, but they continued having sex in the room in my dads bed when they thought that I was asleep. I was desensitized to sexual content, so there were times that I masturbated to my parents having sex for a rush of taboo, and Im ashamed of it, but I was also a child. I feel like Im severely messed up from my childhood. Im not attracted to my family at all. I hope this doesnt sound racist to say, but because of my abuse and experiences with exposure to sex, I dont feel sexually attracted to people in my race because I perceive them to be one big family to me. It feels genuinely incestous and brings trauma to me if I try perceiving sex someone of the same race as me in a sexual manner. Since I began masturbating, Ive had an on-and-off relationship with porn and masturbation. I think its definitely an addiction that Ive had for the past 14 years, and I dont know how to stop it because its so ingrained in me since I was 4. There are periods of times usually months where I masturbate every day or almost every day, and then there are periods of times that I abstain as well. Ive been trying to stop watching visual porn and switching to erotica, but I think thats just another form of addiction. If you have any insight, thank you.",

And even though Im in a safe and healthy relationship now after leaving an abusive one, I still find myself grieving a version of life that hasnt happenedand might not. Theres no event Im grieving. Its not a breakup or infertility diagnosis or anything like that. Just this aching feeling that Im falling behind, that the life I was so sure Id grow into is slipping further away with each passing year. Has anyone else gone through this? Is there a name for this kind of grief? How did you cope? Any advice or even just solidarity would mean a lot right now. I feel so alone in this, even though logically I know Im not.

    "text": "Recently, my ability to get anything done has been steadily declining and its destroying me. I barely talk to or hang out with any of my friends after school anymore, because Im always either worried about homework and feeling guilty about not doing it, or doing homework and getting almost nothing done. Just last night, I tried to last minute finish an English assignment, and stayed up past midnight to do it. From my memory, I tried to work on it for about an hour, only wrote 12 words, then passed out with my computer still open. I checked today, and it was a bit more than that, and I genuinely dont remember writing those parts. But anyway, tried to do the same today, and here I am, 4 hours in, at 12:26. I have gotten a lot more done than yesterday, but I am still not finished this short story that shouldve been done two days ago. This kinda reflects a common trend among basically all my assignments. Not really sure whats causing it all these issues, my best guess is ADD inattentive ADHD, burnout, hormones, or maybe all of them tag teaming my ass. But I am absolutely miserable. Tired constantly. Unproductive. Never really truly enjoy myself anymore. Ive talked to my parents about this, and were secured a doctors appointment to help figure all this out, but Its literally two days before school ends. So Im kinda just strapped in for a really really horrible rest of the school year. I dont know really why Im posting this, I just kinda need to get this all out of my system. And Im sure my friends are tired of hearing my complain all the time, basically every and any time I see them nowadays working on that. So thanks, if you read this. Any advice would benefit me greatly, and be much appreciated.",

    "text": "Location: MI Hello. A few years ago my parents garage caught on fire and the smoke got into the house but nothing really burned, but everything had to be redone to get rid of the smoke smell. This happened at approximately 10PM and we had to evacuate and go somewhere else to stay the night. We came back at 9am the next day and immediately got a cleaning company knocking on our door. They said that they were here to take our clothes and wash them. My parents, who barely spoke English had assumed that they were recommended by their insurance company and therefore signed the agreement to have their clothes taken and washed. The clothing items were mostly all super cheap and old besides a few brands here and there that they convinced my parents would rip up with normal washing and need professional washing. We also had an electronics company come in, and a construction company. When our insurance gave my parents the money to hand out to these companies and gave company involved a split amount, this construction company claimed that they never got their earn and were never paid for the work that they did. We contacted the insurance company and they claimed that this company never contributed nor did anything at all. With the limited amount of money the insurance gave us, we decided to let everyone settle with each other and claim their earnings while also giving some money to that company that claimed they never got their share. The companies kept going back and forth and never decided on anything and most of them stopped responding to us. A few months later, the clothing company started threatening us to pay them or they would file a claim against us. So now, they are taking us to court and demanding more money than the insurance gave to all the companies involved. What is there to even do in this situation? Please let me know I really want to help my parents out. They barely even speak English. Thank you in advance.",

When I was 12, my mom also left to be with him. Since then, it feels like I lost both parents. They talk to my brothers regularly, laugh with them, stay connected. Me? I only hear from them if I make the first move. If I dont reach out, its like I dont even exist. My older brother is now in Japan, supporting them financially. And here I am struggling to survive on a call center salary, barely making it. It makes me think: maybe they just dont see me as worth it. Maybe in their eyes, Im just nothing. Not successful enough. Not lovable enough. Not enough. I try so hard to understand, to give excuses for their absence. But honestly? Im tired. Im tired of feeling like I have to earn a place in my own parents hearts. I didnt ask for this life. I didnt ask to be born just to be treated like an afterthought. I dont even know if they would notice if I just disappeared.",

    "text": "Ive been in a relationship with someone that started about 4.5 months ago. It started off really great, lots of texting, facetiming, etc, and over time its died off, like to the point where we barely text each other once a day and shes extremely hesitant/resistant to facetime. This came to a boiling point last week where I confronted her about it, and she said it was because shes getting really tired of texting/facetiming all the time and shes realized she prefers in person interaction. While I feel the same, that doesnt mean I gave up on the long distance stuff because I know its not permanent. We agreed to do better and resolved it, and things were better for about 3 days and now theyve gone back to the same thing. We had planned to meet each other at the end of June, I was going to fly out to see her and its really not that expensive/disruptive to do so, but honestly after how things have been going lately im very unsure now. Im curious what people think, is it better to go visit her or just say F it and end things?",

    "text": "I 20M have been with my girlfriend 20F for about a year now. By no means am I perfect but throughout our relationship weve have many fights over small stupid stuff. For example, one of our fights was about how I stained the ear muffs with drawing charcoal by accident, drawing charcoal is very easy to wash out and i offered to wash it out for her. We fight about small things like this every few days and it just sucks. She ignores me and treats me like shit whenever we fight. It just always feels like my girlfriend gets mad at me over the smallest thing, and the smallest thing can set her off. Shes very stubborn and very emotional, and shes never tried to resolve or end a fight. Every fights ends up with me apologizing even when i dont believe im wrong. The last big fight we had, we almost broke up. We had a serious talk about how we should communicate with eachother better and what we both need to work on. The fights have definitely improved, and weve had less and been able to communicate better. I love her so much and more than anything. The problem here is that although our fights have decreased in severity, we still have them. She still ignores me and doesnt treat me the best during arguments, but much less than before. Shes making progress, but sometimes its hard for me to stick with her. Another thing is that shes very closed minded. For example, if she has an opinion or point of view, its very hard maybe even impossible for her to change it. This becomes difficult in arguments. Sometimes, I just want to break it off, but i know ill regret it. I feel like im being impatient and expecting her to change immediately. I dont know what to do. I know how ive described her here doesnt sound very good, but shes an amazing girlfriend besides from when we fight, and shes made amazing progress. I dont know if its worth the heartache now. I need some advice guys, thank you",

    "text": "Im too lazy to type so Im gonna copy and paste what I shared to ChatGPT Imagine youre a 15 year old kid in 2016. Youre in 10th grade and youre thinking about your future. You think about what you wanna be, you have so many aspirations, you think about your future wife, kids, etc. You go on a social media platform popular at the time and one day, youre invited to a group chat with people youve chatted with, and then also a couple new people. One of them seems like youd wanna get to know them, but youre too scared to show yourself and talk on a call, but thats okay, nobodys pushing you to do any of that. But you start texting this new girl while youre in the car, bored at a party your parents took you to. You get to know her a little more and she seems like a really nice person. You do nothing but text her for an hour or 2 without realizing time passing. She talks to you about something shes been pretty sad about and you try to comfort her thats the first spark. Now all you can think about is this girl. Then, you text her the next day, and the next day. You text on the group chat, hoping to see her chatting in it, and you start talking to her in there. One of your friends who invited you, mentions Hey it looks like these 2 are gonna be together AND NOBODY MENTIONS THE COMMENT HE MADE BECAUSE THE GROUP CHAT ISNT FOCUSED ON HIM. Well, you and this girl talk and you finally get the courage to finally text her these couple of words or couple hundred Hey so I uh wanted to tell you something and she asks what is it.. AND YOU STALL THROUGH TEXT. Well you finally spill it out I kinda like you. Followed by a really?? And you reply yes and it feels like the whole world stops. Until she replied I like you too XD and YOU FEEL THE MOST HAPPY YOUVEE EVER BEEN IN YOUR LIFE. Well you talk to this girl for months, you get to know about her, she gets to know about you. You never showed her your face cause youre fat and youre scared to show her cause youd think the relationship would end. But she shows you her pictures AND SHES GORGEOUS!! You find out where she lives, you both live in Los Angeles, she lives in the valley and you live in south la thats too far for normal teens to go to each other. You dont have cars and your parents dont know about this. Well yeah, now all you wanna do is go to her. You imagine the dates you could go on. She tells you hey I was thinking if on the summer youd like to go on a date somewhere and this is the biggest fumble of your life you reply Id love to, but the thing is, Ive never shown you how I look like : and she goes oh okay, its alright : and she doesnt even get upset at you. She loves you, but youre so stupid, you dont realize her love for you is bigger than anything. Shell love you no matter what at this moment. Well, the relationship continues for more months, you go out of the country and you dont have signal for 2 WEEKS!! That feels like years as a teenager!!! You can text her every now and then when theres some signal, but you cant text her for hours anymore. You feel the relationship is starting to fade as soon as you get home. You text her and she texts you, but theres no more life. You try your hardest to keep it going and its basically beating a dead horse. Theres no point cause the relationship is dead. Well, she asks you for a picture of you, finally giving you the courage and you do it the relationship doesnt end right away, but it ends about a week into you showing the picture. She assures you thats not the reason. She just got bored. Well, you ball your eyes out and you move on after a while. This was 8 years ago. Now youre driving, you have your own car, youre working and you end up in Van Nuys. YOURE THROUGH THE ROOFS!! YOU FINALLY MADE IT THERE. IM GONNA GO VISIT HER. But wait, whats the point? Nobodys there. Nobodys waiting for you, nobody there wants you anymore. Theres no point in being there. Its lonely. Imagine this scenario. That was my life on October of 2024. I thought this feeling was gone I saw her profile again and shes engaged now. Look, I know I fumbled way too many times, I had no idea what I was doing back then, but I just wish I had some closure to this. Theres no way something 8 years ago should hurt this badly. I dont want her back honestly, but I wish I could have one last conversation with her, in person cause I never got to have that. I also never got to experience young love in person and that experience I had makes me regret so much. I swear I dont know what to do about this. I typed this into ChatGPT, but of course ai doesnt help. Can someone give me advice? Is it just something that attacks you out of the blue and it goes away again? But its been attacking me since October. I swear I feel my heart drop just thinking about this. Its like a what if, yknow?",

However, theres been one thought that has been bothering me, what if Im missing out on my youth? Hes dating to marry, but I dont know if I can commit to him. I feel as if Im too young to settle down and live with him, but I love him so much. Im gonna be turning 19 next month and hes expressed his concern of me getting into drinking. Even though Ive told him Im not interested in becoming an alcoholic, I dont like the hangovers. But Im more interested in meeting new people and gaining new friends. I dont know if Im setting for our relationship for failure, I love him but Im just scared to settle down. I just need help and advice. Like am I gonna ruin something good??",

Upon returning the car, I asked for an inspection but it was going to take a while and I was in a rush. STUPIDLY I had forgotten to take any photos at the start due to my excitement. 2 weeks later SIXT sends me a photo of the worlds smallest scratch 2mm asking for 1000. Mind you this photo was taken 3 hours after I had returned the car and it was in a completely different bay. I told them essentially and politely to get fucked not a chance. They first sent Riverty Debt collection onto me and after I told them I flat out am not paying they buggered off. 3 months later and Paris Contentiuex have just sent me a rather scary email saying I have 48 hours to now pay 1200 otherwise its legal action. Surely they wouldnt come after me through the Australian legal system and if they did what might happen? Any advice or similar experiences? Thanks. Legends.",

    "text": "Im 35, m from san Diego, ca. Currently reside in the Phoenix area in Arizona. So Im in a scuffle with my family, for good reason. Location: Phoenix area, AZ I moved to a different state to better my life from a troubled past, mainly drug use, never been arrested, record is all clean. I wanted to finally move out and be on my own, but my brother insisted I put down money with him to buy a bigger house, so I bought in. The very first paycheck I wrote, I wrote mortgage on it, because we clearly bought this house, not rent, my brother insisted I write rent on it instead, immediately I thought to myself this isnt a good start the reason he told me to do that, he said will qualify to get some food stamps to help pay for food my job wasnt a very high paying job, I was making 16 an hour working 40 hours a week. My brother makes a lot more, so I would qualify to put food on the table for us. So I bought in. Let me note, as I was growing up, I realized my father and brother have been stealing welfare for a long time, maybe even before I was born, but I didnt realize until recently. Right before I moved to Arizona, 4 years ago. My dad would work 50-60 hours a week, and only claim 10 hours on his paychecks so he would qualify for all government assistant programs. The thing that bothers me about this is how his employers would do that for him. Anyway, my family is very narcissistic, Im sick of living here because its impossible to be happy living here, constant arguments, constant unnecessary finger pointing, etc. its just plain ugly. So, now, when I tell my brother can I have my money that I put down towards the house so I can go live on my own 30k... Those are my life savings, and i cannot leave on my own without it. Now he says, what money? Youre paying rent .. I lost my mind. Now youre seeing how I claim these people narcissistic. It has been on going for about 3 months now, he still wont tell the truth and pay me my money. I threatened to kill his family if he doesnt end up giving my money back I know thats wrong and dumb, and I know that can get me in legal trouble to scare him and hopefully he would buy in, he doesnt seem hesitant, and I love his family I would never do that. What can I do here?",

I dont accept this kind of a language at all, even though I am 100 on his side that these people have done bad things. I still dont wish death upon anyone. He hasnt ever been violent towards me and overall I have tought that he is kind and wise man. But this is a huge problem for me We had a talk about this and he said that he has just tought they are words, he hasnt realized how brutal it might sound. He said that in reality he doesnt want to hurt anyone, but he is just used to make these kind of comments. And he said that he understand that I feel uneasy because of these comments.",

    "text": "We havent been together for very long, its been one month. Everything prior to us being official was amazing. We had no issues whatsoever. However, as soon as we become a thing, everything changed. She got a cold shoulder, she doesnt talk to me the way she used to, shes always putting off talking about problems or issues within the relationship. She also changed the password to her phone. I keep asking her to talk about the problems and at certain times when we finally do, it seems everything is fine and it all works out. But come the next day, nothing changes. Everything stays the same and its as if the conversation never happened. I feel like I keep chasing and I am getting no where. I really like this girl and I really want this to work. When we hang out in person, things are great. I have no complaints. But, when we go about our daily lives, we rarely text she doesnt text me and it feels as if we arent together in any way. Im fed up with feeling this way. Its been this way ever since we got together.",

    "text": "Right so, im not used to this. Anyways this is a throwaway account. Hi everyone Im 29F, married to 30M for 6 years now. Known them for 10. I want to start this by saying, that no my husband is not gay, and no he is not cheating on me. So, My husband and I were friends, then we dated for 4 years before he finally proposed and I accepted. He was literally a dream man, keyword here is Was. Granted i was a drama queen back then, and he was still patient and loving. If I was depressed, or had my panic attacks or PTSD episodes, he would drive an hour and a half to get to me. Just to take care of me. Because my family is toxic with capital T. Anyways, once we got married, everything changed. Over a year time, he went from being caring about every little detail, taking care of every little issue, taking responsibility of everything to just.. nothing. I was in my masculine era before that, since I was taking care of my large family, he literally took me out of that, loved me, and made me believe that there is more to this world than absive families and my anxiety. Then like a switch, he flipped. No longer caring man, no longer the loving, hugging, touchy-feely man. All he wants is to be left alone with his gaming, and the occasional chore hed do out of courtesy. I cook, clean, wash and even do financial management in the house. Keep in mind he is the sole bread winner, but when he has the money it is all spent on games, upgrades and everything else that could quite literally leave us with no food on the table. There is no real intimacy like it used to be, i even suggested to go to a couple counseling, therapy, anything to get us out of this. But he refuses saying and I quote There is nothing wrong with this relationship. Youre overreacting and overthinking it. Yes, I am hung up on him, he is the only man I actually gave a chance to. Specially since I was against marriage and love completely. Also, I am Bi, so I dated girls only before him. So, what do you suggest?",

    "title": "my 26f bf 28m is a stinky liar! how do i forgive him?",
    "text": "hi guys im posting in this subreddit for advice on how two youngsters in love can move on from this. as the title says, my boyfriend of four years has lied to me over the course of the last 8-12 months. If all came to a head today when i was looking for a usb and thought maybe it mightve been in his bag bc i was desperate to find this usb. in opening it, i found a pack of cigarettes and instantly fell nauseous because this meant that this year of sobriety was actually a lie and i had been the fool for the last 12 months. I sat with the feelings for a bit and realized i was more angry with the lying than i was about the fact that he was smoking again. i knew things had been tough for him lately and he had been mentioning how bad he wanted a cig and i have always been supportive and understanding and asked if he wanted to explore that more and hes denied it. i believed he wanted to be sober and i felt like a fool for believing it. there have also been other instances were hes come home smelling like smoke and has told me it was bc he was with friends who still smoke and i believed him bc my best friend is a heavy smoker and i always reek after i see him because of his chain smoking in his car. all of this made me feel insanely angry and upset. I confronted my bf when he was done work since he works from home and asked him firmly if he wanted to tell me anything at all and that i was just looking for the truth. rather than confide in me with his struggle to quit and be honest he lied right through his teeth and all throughout the night. his story didnt make sense though and i kept asking questions and poking through the holes in his story. the confrontation happened around 6 and after enough poking he finally told me he lied around 11pm because he couldnt keep up the lie anymore and i lost it and just broke down and cried. it felt like in that moment that if he could lie like that after i had given him chances to be honest then what else is he lying about. he swears up and down he hasnt lied about anything else and i believe him mostly because my instincts and intuition felt uneasy about his story immediately after i confronted him but i feel no ways about anything now and i truly trust my intuition. I know that hes an addict and that his lying stems from shame and guilt and he also very much handled conflict very poorly but man am i upset. i also know that couples fight and argue and that lies worse than this have probably happened in marriages that have lasted 50 years and the key is always something about patience and forgiveness but man sometimes i fear running is easier than forgiving. especially after the year ive had, running definitely feels easier. ive gone no contact with 2 siblings and low contact with another and i havent seen my mom in months because of my piercings so its gotten really easy to just. leave or walk away but i know it takes effort and energy in relationships for it to work and that love is an action and not just an isolated feeling. knowing all that doesnt make the running away feelings disappear though and thats where my plea for advice comes in. for those who have navigated lies similar or bigger than this, or for those who have navigated a partner than will avoid conflict at all costs even if it means digging a massive hole no matter what, what advice do you have for forgiveness and patience and working through it? would you have left or would u have worked though it? my bf has agreed to go to therapy for his phobia of conflict and adhd but what can i on my part to fight for this relationship and not run like i usually do because i really do love him but im just sooo angry.",

    "text": "So my bf and I both live really close to our parents/ families. We currently live in an apartment complex and his family mom, brother, and sister all live on the first floor and we live on the second. We also have a dog. My bfs brother has spare key to our place that stays on his key ring. He will occasionally come up and grab our dog for a walk if were both busy and both give him permission to do so. My bfs sister moved back in with their mom a few months ago and honestly, shes not that great. She would constantly say I was the reason my bf stopped giving her money and stopped caring for her. Shes 2 years older than him were both 21. My bf worked today and he always needs his headphones since he makes a lot of calls at work. I left our place later in the day, so after 5, no one was home. We both got home together and when we did, my bf was quick to realize some headphones were on our coffee table. They are the same brand just different model so he was confused because for a second he thought they were his but realized his were actually in his pocket. He opened them and saw that they were his sisters she has a different color but the case they come in are the same. I started to freak out a bit because right before I left, I was doing some exercises and I moved the coffee table and cleaned it up and didnt notice ANY headphones. And like I said, my bfs needs his headphones for work so if I had noticed them, I would have been quick to text him to let him know he forgot them. He texted his brother asking if him or their sister were up in our apartment and he said no but his sister called him right after and said that he grabbed them on Tuesday by accident when he was visiting their apartment. My bf started doubting himself but the thing is, if they have been there since Tuesday, how did we BOTH not notice? My bfs headphone case are very beat up because of how much he used them, and hers is the opposite. I also found it weird she didnt bug him about her headphones for two days considering how possessive she is over her things. We also ate on the coffee table this morning and didnt see any headphones. The only thing that makes my bf and I doubt she was here is because his brother has the key on him and he went to work and he also doesnt give her the key. I trust him because he is genuine so now I feel bad because I dont know what to do. His sister just has a history of being a bitch so I kind of already just want to put the blame on her. I suggested to my bf for us to just act like it really was our fault and we didnt notice the headphones until now, while also placing a camera and not telling them about it. Does that sound like a good idea? I can also just asks for the key back but I fear that would make it obvious we dont trust them, same if we just change the lock. Is there another way I should go about this?",

I instead messaged her saying Im going to mo you which is weird if you dont get the dynamic of our friendship. It was meant as a joke as weve often joked about touching each other innapropriately before but never actually done it. She sent me a screen record of her reporting me and I thought it was a joke or at least it wouldnt lead anywhere. Around 15 minutes later I get a suspension on my account and a way to appeal it. This was at night so I did the apeal in the morning, I was permanently banned. I dont know if theres any way for me to get that account back as it was my main one and the only means to message certain friends Ill probably never see again and Im devated. I tried to use my alternative account which I lit never touched after creating it and that was also suspended with the option to appeal but that just seems pointless. I made a new account and that gotinstantlyu suspended. I know it sounds childish to betworked over Instagram but I cant message my friends who I made over the years. That account was probably 10 years old and Im so pissed at my friend for reporting it as shes often said similar things to what I did and I never reported it. I dont know what to do",

    "text": "Ok so this is like a long one but Basically a bit before the spring break, all my friends were being weird with me and they made a gc without me. They would make plans to go out without me. So during spring break I decided to ghost everyone. For the 3 weeks I got msg twice. The first time the guy asked me about my sisters story cause he didnt wanna msg her, and the second time was my best friend asking me to go to his birthday. I decided to show up and they were all being weird to me and give my each other looks. So now were back at school and my best friend asked me to go out with the group. I told him no and that was the end of that. During this time, he spread rumors about my sister. Which is when I first started ignoring him. He apologized and I ended up forgiving him. We went back to normal for a week. This is when they all started being assholes. They started throwing stuff at me like 3 times a week. And they all decided to talk about there plans right in-front of me. Now that didnt bother me that much but did feel a bit annoying. I didnt care that much about them so sometimes I would talk to them. But when it came to my best friend, every time I looked at him I would remember and I would just ignore him. Its been a month and today he apologized. I asked him for what, he said and I quote for what ever I did I then explained it to him, that the reason I would sometimes talk to them and not you was because you were my best friend. He said what he did was wrong and how he was sorry. He then left. And now I dont know what to do. I want to forgive him but like he was a pretty big ass hole. And I dont know how to go back to normal. Please help",

    "text": "I, 20f and my dad 56m have always had this debate on if Im actually gay or not since I was in 6th grade. Ive always known I was pansexual. Ive really known since I was in the 3rd grade. But, when I figured out that girls could date girls, and there was other genders out there besides being a girl, or a boy I soon came to the realisation I just liked every one and really didnt have a preference thus, realising I was pansexual. When I came out to my dad about this, he flipped out on me. His reasoning, I was WAY too young to know what my sexuality truly was. He made a good point, but, Ive dated and have done other things with people that werent cis men, as well as been with cis men and felt no preference towards any gender. We got into an argument a couple nights ago about how hes still homophobic, and doesnt even understand what pansexuality means. I explained again, although there are more than just two genders, and that sex is different from gender, but he blew up at me screaming that I was just, bi and confused. This really pissed me off, because he doesnt know my sexuality because hes not me. I blew up on him, calling him homophobic and trans phobic because he wouldnt shut up about how much he disliked trans people which pissed me off even more because I have plenty of trans friends, and theyre wonderful! Plus, we werent even talking abt trans people! I was talking about MYSELF, and MY sexuality. He then continues to yell at me, bringing up stuff that I do that frustrates him, even though we werent even talking about that. All I wanted from this conversation, was for him to respect my sexuality and referred to me as pansexual instead of bisexual. I understand hes from a different generation, and I wasnt asking him to change any of his opinions or views on anything! All I wanted, was for him to respect me and who I am. I really need some help here. Im in a dark situation and Im not sure what to do.",

I feel like I know a bit about her, I know her interests and some of the ideals she has but the one thing Im really horrible at is care. When shes upset I cant do much to make her feel better. She says that if I understood her and knew her Id be able to help and I dont doubt that. I just dont know what Im supposed to do when she is upset. And usually when I cant help with the initial problem it turns into the bigger problem of I dont know what she wants. I also think because this has been such a major problem that Ive unintentionally conditioned myself to get anxious as soon as I get a hint of her being upset because Im almost never successful with this and then in my brain its like her upset day over which fucking sucks because she should be able to be upset and be able to rely on me. I just dont know what to do, how to be better. Ive fucked so so so much but I dont know how to be better. How can I be better at taking care of her? How can I start understanding her more?",

And i found one, I was given the opportunity to be eligible in applying, all i need is to turn in the requirements, theyll process it and if i pass, I will be interviewed. The requirements are easy to acquire, my real problem lies with the interview, as although it will be conducted online, Im too afraid that Ill mess it up. For context, Ive always been terrified of doing impromptu, whether itd be speeches, oral recitations or answering in professional setting, it would often turn me into a living dead literal brainless, could not think of anything. Sweats profusely and would turn cold like a literal corpse. I apologize if Im just blabbering and not going directly to the point, but I wanted to give you some context so I you wouldnt misunderstand. I did not know who else to turn to, so I instead figured maybe I can ask here. May you please give me advice or if you have even just a little bit experience in being interviewed for a scholarship, please do tell me what questions or anything I should for. Ps: The scholarship Im trying to apply for is called U-GO Scholar Grant, partnered by Ayala Foundation Sincerely yours, Ray.",

    "title": "Business Purchase and Discovery of Fraud",
    "text": "Location: A year ago, I purchased a commercial roadside tire service business for 1,000,000. The company operates as a licensed dealer for a national tire brand. Its primary source of revenue comes from the following model: The national tire brand has contracts with trucking companies across the country to provide roadside assistance. When a truck requires a new tire, the trucking company contacts the national brand, which then subcontracts the service to local dealerssuch as the business I acquired. The trucking company specifies that the national brand tire be used, and my company dispatches a technician to perform the installation. Shortly after the purchase, during the transition and training period, I discovered that the previous owner had been installing non-brand foreign tires instead of the required national brand tires. Despite this, work orders were submitted to the national tire company falsely indicating that national brand tires were installed. My company would then be reimbursed at the higher price of the national brand tire, even though a cheaper tire was used. After consulting with an attorney, I was advised that this constituted fraud and was instructed to stop the practice immediately. As a result of ceasing these fraudulent activities, the business has not been profitable. I have since filed a civil lawsuit against the seller. During discovery, it became evident that nearly 300 inaccurate work orders had been submitted in the 12 months prior to the sale, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars in misrepresented revenue. I am now a year into litigation, which has placed a significant financial burden over 100,000 on my family as I attempt to recover the purchase price. The seller continues to deny any wrongdoing and has made false statements in court filings. Im concerned that by the time this case concludes, legal fees will have consumed most or all of the purchase funds or the seller will stash away the money and I fear the seller may ultimately be judgment-proof. So far, I have not reported this to law enforcement, but Im strongly considering doing so. Im looking for guidance on: Whether I should file a criminal complaint based on what Ive uncovered Whether I should report this to agencies such as the state attorney general, a consumer protection bureau, or a fraud division What financial options exist, such as litigation funding or bankruptcy protection, to help me get through this process. I want to pursue every appropriate legal avenue but also protect my family from further financial damage. Any direction or advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": "Im a 19yr old f college student. I have never been in a relationship but Ive been in situationships and other stuff. I feel really fucked up. No relationship but 4 bodies. Its not that I regret them, I just feel like so lost when it comes to guys. One of the guys I met recently we are NOT talking or anything just syk Hes a great guy and accepts me for all of my past mistakes and issues. Weve met and hung out and I can say he is truly a good guy. Hes my age, in college too, and were only 45 mins from each other. He knows about how I was blackmailed, Ive sent nudes before, Ive had a sugar daddy, all of my insecurities and he still accepted me. - This was so confusing to me. Ive never really told anyone all of that, no one. But I told him and I got a reaction I never expected. It was hard to accept because by telling him that I thought he would be disgusted by me, block me, want to stop talking, etc. But he told me he understood, and while its not ideal, its not a deal breaker. After he accepted me after telling him about my blackmail situation I was still being blackmailed at that time, I was like surprised and things went on. But then I decided to tell him about how I had a sugar daddy before, thinking that would make him decide to go. Its not that I wanted him to go. But rather I didnt feel I deserved to be accepted for those things and Ive never met and never thought I would meet someone who accepted me even after. I told him and he stayed. He found it funny thank goodness lol and said he understood and that it was okay. Overall, he is great. The only thing is his height. We are the same height. But who am I to not give him a chance because of his height after he accepted me for everything I told him, he genuinely likes me, and he was willing to still peruse things with me despite my situation. Someone told me it could be something I come to really like about him and I think theyre right. But the reason I feel so fucked up is because of my other situations. First guy which I talked about here before has a gf now, so that kind of figured out itself. But with him, it would be 2 am and he texted me and I would go head Every time. I just wanted to see him, didnt matter why I was going. Thats hard to stop. The other guy, we meet for sex and head, okay. Then theres the sugar daddy. That I still have. I need him financially. I want to at some point pursue things with the main guy who accepted me but how? Overall, idk how to say it but I havent been in a relationship and I am scared to be in one because I have only had situations. I am not one for commitment, I dont even like the commitment of friendships. But I want to give him a chance. I just dont know what to do and I feel like shit. Why cant I be friends with guys without it being that. I find them attractive and I give in. I dont feel disgusting but I feel I dont know the word. I dont feel normal and I hate it.",

    "text": "I, 25-F, have been dating my GF, 24-F for around 1 year now. Shes my first serious relationship but I am her 4th. Things went really well the first sixth months, shes so beautiful and funny and I love hanging out, but she also has a lot of situational, family, and over all life circumstances that are pretty difficult. She struggles with her mental health and I try my best to support her. She has been in a sort of depressive episode for a while, but shes functioning to some extent. She has a job , she meets with friends. She just doesnt take interest in life as much anymore in general, constantly anxious , stressed, has a deep sadness in general. we stopped having sex, shes much less affectionate. I dont want to break up but I am feeling really ignored and forgotten about. Weve talked about it a couple times but i dont think either of us know how to move forward. Shes giving me all thats in her capacity but I dont feel loved, but I also dont want to break up just because shes having a hard time and cant meet my needs right now. What are some ways to move forward that dont entail us breaking up? TLDR: GF is depressed and cant meet relationship needs from my end. I want to be there for her but also dont know how to not feel insecure and unloved. How can I make this work?",

Leaving projects like always, Ive been so obsessed with structures its ruining the fun. Time blocking, todo, pomodoro, saying no, routines, journaling, 12 week year, cue and respond, and many. Ive tried everything yet it all overwhelmed me. Just do it? I did, and felt lost again. Its like I know bits and pieces of all my hobbies and interests. I want to learn about film, about design, about psychology, copywriting, about how the world works...yet what is piling up is not my notebooks/projects but plans and structures. What should I do? Edit: adhd? I dont know. Ive seen a doctor a year ago and all they said is youre stressed, try going on a vacation, do meditation. I also am going tight on budget to see another.",

    "title": "My girlfriendF18 is deeply hurt over old photos of meM18 hugging a female friend from before we dated feeling frustrated and confused. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",
    "text": "Hey Reddit, Im in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some perspective. My girlfriend and I started dating on November 27 last year. Before we officially dated, we were in a pretty serious situationshipstarted talking around August/Septemberand we were exclusive in the sense that we told each other we werent talking to anyone else. About a month before we started dating, I hugged a close female friend weve known each other for over 2 years. It was a close, affectionate hugher head on my chest, my arms around her. Nothing romantic happened, and this was long before my girlfriend and I were official. I didnt hide this from her, but I never showed her pictures or talked about it because it was before we were together. Recently, my girlfriend saw a post from this friend showing me hugging her. Since then, shes been really hurtcrying, taking medication, and even asking for a break. She said my chest was her safe place, and seeing someone else there triggered her deeply. She feels like I was giving affection to someone else after getting upset about her talking to a guy or taking another guys jacket, which feels hypocritical to me. Ive apologized and reassured her repeatedly that I love her, that those hugs meant nothing beyond friendship, and that I stopped hugging anyone like that a month before we started dating. Ive told her now those hugs are only for her, but shes still very upset. For context, my girlfriend grew up with less physical affection, while I was raised with a lot of it, so we perceive touch very differently. What frustrates me is that: This happened before we dated. I didnt cheat or betray her trust. Ive been transparent and never meant to hurt her. She had a sexual relationship 2nd base with her ex her first, Im her second. I was bothered by that initially because she was my first regarding sexual things, but I accepted it since it was her pasther relationship with him ended 8 months before we started dating which is why it hurt me more. I tried to be as mature as possible about it and I passed it off. Also, during the first month of dating that ex, she was coerced into something she didnt want molested, and later they were intimate willingly. I know her past is painful. She feels like I took something special from her, and I feel like Im being punished for something that happened before we were together. Our communication is strained because her pain is so raw and intense. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I help her heal without feeling unfairly blamed? How do we move forward? Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "We broke up over something unrelated. Got back together and I went through his phone. He had tiktok which is kinda weird to me because hes 32 and IMO that app is for teenagers and kids. He searched porn and all sorts, I dont care about that we were broken up its expected, but most disturbing was that he was searching school uniforms and school baddies. I just feel gross that he was masturbating to teenagers in school uniforms. Am I over-reacting? Is this normal? I just cant imagine ever downloading tiktok and searching school boys and masturbating over it like thats gross to me. I experienced a lot of sexual trauma as a teenager when I still had the mind of a kid, so shit like this kinda just makes me sad. When we drive past at school time and girls have super short skirts Im just gonna feel weird AF now. Hes pointed out girls school uniform in the past and said it was disgusting. But clearly he is attracted to it. He was actively searching short school dresses. Am I being dramatic? People say its normal for guys to like young women right. Idk this just feels wrong to me",

Probably sounds dramatic, but its real. Its weird because I do have strong beliefs and opinions, but when it comes to me how I see myself, how I carry myself I just really dont like who I am.Ive always felt like I was in the shadows of others. Like I shrink myself. And anytime I try to do something out myself, I just cringe. Compliments make me uncomfortable, I either deflect or laugh them off and I cant even say a thank you to a compliment without cringing Its tiring. Feeling unsure with everything I do. Im tired of feeling this way. Tired of letting this lack of confidence ruin different aspects of my life.So Im thinking what if I just start faking it? Like, fully pretend Im confident until hopefully it becomes real. Is that actually possible? Has anyone done that? Tips? Advice? Does anyone relate to this?",

We met in a random vr chat lobby in October of last year and when I asked him how old he was he said he was 18. For the first few months we were just friends we played games and hung out on vr regularly but I started to catch feelings around December and didnt say anything for a while. In mid February I told him how I felt and when he said he felt the same way I was really happy. On to present day we were in a call he was watching a show and I was playing video games when the topic of birthdays came up his birthday is in July so its a bit away but I wanted to know if he wanted anything I cant get him anything too crazy because we are long distance but I still wanted to get him something but during our idle talk he said the full date of his birth which I wont say for privacy reasons but I could of sworn I heard him say 2007which would make him 17. It didnt hit me at first because I had one headphone on and I was playing a game so I was only half listening but when I realized what I thought he said my heart sank. I didnt say anything because I figured I just heard him wrong and thought nothing of it but the last couple of days I havent been able to stop thinking about it. I afraid to ask him about it because if I was wrong then that would probably lead to an argument and due to past trauma I shut down whenever someone starts to get an angry tone to their voice but Im also afraid that if I was right that Ive been dating someone underage for the past 2 months and the thought of that makes me sick but at the same time I dont know how to feel because I love him. Please help and advice on the situation would be great and sorry for any typos or run on sentences my grammar isnt the best. Thanks",

    "text": "He has a Polish last name and I have a German last name. My last name comes from my paternal grandmother who was a refugee during WW2. I have a lot of pride in my last name and I took German for 4 years in high school and have tried to stay up to date in German since then. My fiance on ther other hand had no idea that his name ending in ski basically meant he was Polish. He had no idea what a perogi was and has never had any Polish family tradition. My main issue is that he is completely fine with other untraditional norms, but he has a hard time adjusting to the fact that I dont want to give up my last name that I have a great emotional tie to. He has a far less emotional tie to his own last name, but has an issue with us giving our future children my last name since its not traditionally how it works. Please give me some advice. Were both in the US and his mom and dad have been divorced for more than 10 years. He has no emotional ties to his last name. The only argument for me to take his last name is that this is the way things have traditionally been done. Were both in the northern US states, so none of these norms actually matter. Im having a hard time dealing with this side of him. When we get married in a couple months, hes fine with me making my last name phyphenated. But when we have kids, he expects them to all have his last name only. I dont know how else to navigate this",

    "text": "I have a friendgirl who i was very close with for 2 years and then she suddenly stopped talking to me , became distant and acted like we dont know each other , other than being colleagues. This really made me upset and i had hard time accepting this since she and i used to tell each other everything and call discuss notes and exam and everything. she would tell me all about her family friends bf etc.. i would listen and i have opened up to her many times. This phase of being distant lasted like a whole year and then we got close again, started texting and calling but didnt dicuss anything personal only study related and stuff like that , so i thought okay let it be i need someone to ask these things about. but now she started being distant again. i can see it in her face when she sees me she fakes a smile and when talking its only one word reply to whatever i ask .. texts wont get response for a whole day and the reply would be one word.. Does she hate me?? why?? i never did anything wrong to her.. i had confronted this behaviour to her multiple times and she denied its existence while doing the same. i could go on describing more and more about this if anyof you want but im really depressed right now . idk what to do .. whenever i see her irl and being distant i feel something in my body thats so wrong feeling neglected having to ignore her while she is friendly with everyone else , she talking to other people like she used to talk to me but when its with me she doesnt have anything to talk about - im so done idk what to do , and if i have the strength to do so? ig i have so little self respect , if anyone else be in my shoes they would have already stopped even looking at her i need some advice here",

Knowing she has been with someone, it did feel bad for a few mins then i was totally normal could be because ive dug into evolutionary biology and a bit of Ashtavakra Geeta Even though my partner being physical with someone else before me isnt a dealbreaker for me, i dont wanna get back to her neither do i wanna be with somebody else A bit about the relation: We met online. It was her who confessed it when things started, we had been really really good friends besties for over a year, we were together after the confessions for about 8 months and in all this time, i never really initiated the physical stuff sxt stuff, it was her. She asked me to meet and i couldnt for some time then when i would say okay, ill make a plan, she would say let it be for now. Then things kinda escalated downwards. we fought and things went south and then we just stopped talking and she had blocked me for a long time. Then she unblocked me twice and we just dig up the past and then nothing. Fast-forward to a couple of weeks back, she texts me normally, which was surprising for me, but it was just hi how are you kinda stuff. some days i happened to be in her city for some work purposes, so i dialed up to have a bit of convo and to meet her i just wanted to meet or rather see someone i once loved. the convo didnt go that well, she just said enjoy the trip before i could say anything and we hung up. Fast-forward to last night, all the talks i mentioned above happened. IDK if im looking for advices, but i am clear that i am not looking for anything more than acquaintance or even friends with ANYONE. but yeah the comment section is open.",

    "text": "Location: CA So long story short, my bosses split their company up into two LLCs back in January and now theyre completely publically splitting up and its super messy. They are arguing over whose employee I technically am and lawyers are now involved. I want to resign effective immediately and stay working for the other boss, but Im concerned that the litigious boss will retaliate by say going to IT and finding instances of me slacking off at work or anything else Ive unwittingly done wrong and then report that to the boss who Im choosing to stay with, leading to THAT boss firing me. Would that be considered unlawful retaliation in response to my resignation?",

    "text": "Location: Utah I posted recently on here but I have updates to the situation I was supervising the self check out lane at the Whole Foods store I work at, and someone comes over with NON-alcoholic wine, but it still asked me to ID him. But at my store I was trained that I dont have to ID everyone, I only have to ID people that look 40 or younger in the employees opinion, the employee is aloud to bypass the screen and does NOT have to scan/see the customers ID if they appear to be older then 35. Also for some reason non alcoholic beer doesnt require an ID, but non alcoholic wine does. This customer looked like he was around 40 years old or so, but I ended up asking to see his ID, but the rule is, once I ask for an ID, the customer than HAS to provide an ID, which I dont remember being told that rule during my original training. But anyway, he got a bit upset and asked if I could just bypass it. I did because of the other rule that if someone looks in my opinion 40 or older, I can bypass it without getting into trouble, But Because I asked first to see an ID and because he did provide it. I got final warning. I had no previous warnings and Ive been working here for 8 months, never called out once, and Ive been on time every single day. And it jumped straight to a final. Also, it escalated to HR somehow and it took them 5 days to come to that decision. So I was scared I was gonna get fired for 5 days straight while still having to go to work without knowing if Ill have a job or not the next day. Was I in the wrong here? I need a second opinion.

    "text": "I often heard people say that high interest rates are bad for this, bad for that... High interest rates make borrowing more costly but at the same time makes investing/lending much more attractive. For example, suppose you get a 300k mortgage, and you make 300k. Although the loan has 6.5 interests, you can pay off the loan in a few years. At the same time what you can do is to invest in bonds and stocks that will give you high return Why? If you buy bonds, the minimum yield will be 4 now, which is much higher than the yield when the interest rate is close to 0. For stocks, the required return is even much higher than 4 because stocks are risker than bonds. So if we can pay off our loans asap and invest aggressively which we should do, high interest rate is a very good thing.",

    "title": "M22 F23 I dont know what to do my ex ruined my girlfriends things",
    "text": "I have been dating my girlfriend for a month and a half and me my ex was broken up for a month. I know I jumped relationships pretty fast but I never felt love with my ex. It was watered down and been on the verge of disaster. I tried plenty of times to fix it nothing ever changed. She was moving stuff out and I had already began talking to a new person. Most can say Im in the honeymoon stage of my relationship and that I messed up with my ex but with my feelings I didnt have any only for my new thing I had going on. I found myself gifting and buying dinner all the time and I knew it was a matter of time before I fall in love. I feel this is where I made the mistake. I should have not have moved so fast. Because feelings were way deeper then I could ever imagine. My girlfriend came to my house for a couple days and on the last day we had got dinner and came back to all her things ruined and her car keyed by my ex. She had got into the house because my ex was a lock smith and she felt with locks her whole life. I would have never imagined she would do this. But she did. I have no feelings for her at all I didnt even try and contact her after. None of my things were touched just hers. She cut up all her clothes down the middle so they could not be salvaged. Pulled out each individual tampon she had and put them all over the room and poured out her prescription pills into lotion then poured numerous liquids on top of everything she cut up. She ruined my new relationship and now the girl doesnt want nothing to do with me. I just feel like if we were in-love its something we can get over right ? I really wanted this thing to work really really bad. N I had no control over the situation. I took her shopping right after we dissected everything that had happen. It helped but not completely. I didnt think it would solve much but its the least I can do , I ended up spending a big lump some of cash offered to get her car repainted. But now Im getting ignored and I must admit she has control of my emotions right now and I just want a response from her. I want it to work. She did mention she needs time to think and reflect on the whole situation, wondering if Im someone she wants to deal with. I get it but this is exactly what my ex wanted and she is winning this in this situation. So now Im by myself and hurt. Everyone is hurt in the situation. I just want my girl, my girl just wants time it feels like she might break up with me Im not sure yet but I have been getting ignored while she has time to think and my ex that probably feels 100x worse. Im in a fucked situation and I cant eat or do activities to get my mind off it nothing seems to help. Or to even think the girl I want doesnt want me when I didnt do anything wrong. Hopefully it works out. The time frame has been two days. Then my girlfriend hasnt replied to me in 36 hours the last thing she said to me was she still needs time to gather her thoughts and she will reach out.",

    "text": "My boyfriend 19M is the best thing that has ever happened to me 20F. We have been together for almost 2 years. When I think of all the things I want in a man, my boyfriends exact traits come up. On paper, hes exactly what I want. Almost 8 months ago, our sex life went down hill. TMIHe could never get hard or would go soft right after penetration. This is weird seen as we are pretty young and shouldnt struggle with this type of thing. I began to never even want to try and have sex with him because it would always lead to disappointment. In the past 8 months id say we have only had sex maybe 5 times Recently, i began to become super uncomfortable when hed touch me. Im not a touchy person in general, never have been, always have had boundaries in my relationship. My boyfriend has never crossed my boundaries or made me feel uncomfortable yet I never want him to touch me or see me nude. I kicked him out of my room the other night when I was getting changed and will sometimes yell at him for slightly touching me. I never want to kiss him and sometimes even struggle to say I love him. This is really weird because I do love my boyfriend. He is perfect in my eyes. The worst part is its not like i just dont want to be touched by anyone, its specifically my boyfriend who I dont want to be touched by. Not that I have been fantasizing about other men, but a part of me knows if I wasnt in this relationship I would be fucking some other guy. I dont know what to do. I dont know why I feel this way. I love my boyfriend and I dont want to leave him. I dont think I could find anyone better than him. Is my relationship salvageable? or is it time to move on?",

But we went out the night before and naturally kissed like always. She said I should watch out for signs and apologized profusely. We talked and I expressed that I wish she had told me about this sooner. Ive never dealt with something like this before, but I feel like this couldve been a conversation we couldve had prior. So its not as much of a big deal. Things have been going really well and I would love for us to move past this. I just dont know how to feel. How does one handle this?",

But we went out the night before and naturally kissed like always. She said I should watch out for signs and apologized profusely. We talked and I expressed that I wish she had told me about this sooner. Ive never dealt with something like this before, but I feel like this couldve been a conversation we couldve had prior. So its not as much of a big deal. Things have been going really well and I would love for us to move past this. I just dont know how to feel. How does one handle this?",

    "title": "My M19 partners F19 parents are causing trouble for us both, can I have some help on what to do?",
    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years now, starting in my junior year of school up until now. Ever since we got together, her stepmother and father have been incredibly abusive beyond what they were doing to her before. I happen to have relatively ill parents, one who has been hospitalized several times over the last year and the other who ended up having a mental illness that came and went throughout school and is now here to stay of course, to keep my parents and their issues separate from this, I wont go in-depth into that, and her parents go around and tell their families about my parents and their current issues, something they overheard at the start of my relationship with my gf and have never seemed to have let go of. The stepmother brags about everything to make her look good, from claiming she fixed my girlfriends depression, or that she fixed my partners brothers eating disorder when she pretty much forces the kid to eat everything she makes, even the stuff he doesnt like. She also gloats about how amazing her kids are and compares them to both myself, my girlfriend and her siblings as somehow all of us not being in a medical field makes us scum. Hell, she told my girlfriend while we were dating to cheat on me and sleep around to find the right guy instead of staying with one person. The dad is no good either, a military fellow who sucks up to her and agrees with everything she says, even when he doesnt want to. Hes also got anger issues and thinks Im an asshole who cant respect him for his service because I told him while he was yelling at my partner during dinner to knock it off and let her enjoy the day she had off. Anyhow, after high school the two of us moved out to get away from all of it and do our own thing together, essentially sharing an apartment while in college. Since then, her father has threatened to shoot both me and my dad for some odd reason for taking his daughter from him, and the stepmom has continued to harass and berate my girlfriend over the phone and through text. Ive told my girlfriend while Im not in charge of her and dont want to stop her from having contact with her dad, she should consider cutting the two of them off since they only ever degrade us both and they talk shit about my family especially my dad, who if he wasnt my dad would be my best and closest friend, but shes only ever been indecisive about it. Without them the two of us are inseparable we pretty much do everything together and essentially never argue, and when we do were very quick to come to an agreement or talk things through. Weve also both been supportive of each others studies in school and work and the actual relationship part of our time together is absolutely amazing, but then the parents come into the mix and suddenly I have to play a bout of title defense because she gets beaten down so easily by them and I have to end up arguing with them. I dont even want a problem with them to begin with! I guess what Im trying to get at is what to do about this issue. The relationship without them is amazing and we are practically perfect for one another, but when they come in things just get unbelievably stressful.",

    "text": "Me and my bf have been together for just over a year. Earlier in our relationship I found photos of other girls on his phone. The girls looked like they where screenshots from porn or random online girls. I deleted them all and talked to him about it telling him it made me extremely uncomfortable. I said I wasnt super uncomfortable with him watching porn because I understand a lot of guys do it but I dont want to know about it because it upsets me. He said he didnt want to do anything that upsets me and we kinda left it at that. Fast forward to today, I go over to his place after work and hes asleep in bed. I checked his phone for something and ended up on Google and found his most recent search was some odd porn thing. The other day we where watching something on Google and there was a bunch of weird porn searches that I quested him about but he just said he didnt know why it was on there because he didnt search that. I started looking through his history and found from around 8:25-8:45 he was searching porn but mainly anal including some trans porn and gay porn. We have had anal plenty of times and both enjoy it but the thought of being sexual with him at all now makes me feel kinda gross and foolish. I feel so disgusted and disturbed. Im questioning everything. I just got a job offer in a town 3 hours away and I mainly didnt want to take it because Id be so far from him but now I just feel numb. I dont doubt my bf loves me but this makes me extremely uncomfortable and I just dont know what to do. I also think its important to mention he texted me around 8:30 ish saying he missed me. Thats the part that hurts the most that he was watching that shit and then had no problem texting me after or hell maybe even during. Hes a lot older than me and Im sure has his own personal habits but the fact he denied it the other day and is watching gay stuff idk I just dont know how to feel. I never woke him up, I took most of my stuff and left. How do I go about this? I honestly just dont know what to do.",

Our relationship felt real and grounded when we were physically present in each others lives. But ever since I had to quit my job and move back to my parents homefar away and brokethings have changed, especially in my mind. Ive been desperately looking for a job so I can go back to her. I know its because shes deeply important to me, and that feels justified. But I also see how this desperation is affecting me. Its changing how I behaveits making me say insecure or hurtful things that push her away. Now shes started to take her space. I want to shift my focus back to myself and my personal growth. She once told me, In the end, were all alone in life. Only we can truly take care of ourselves, and our happiness comes from within. So please tell mehow can I reconnect with my sense of value, happiness, and effectiveness? How do I rediscover my identity and worth beyond the relationshipso that not only do I become stronger for myself, but maybe even save the relationship in the process?",

    "title": "I 17F still have feelings for my best friend 18NB whos in a relationship, and I dont know what to do.",
    "text": "So... Ive been holding onto these feelings for a while and I really need to get it off my chest. For context: Im 17, my best friend Ill call them J, 18, NB is in a relationship, and Ive had intense feelings for them for almost two years now. A while back, I was in a toxic relationship with someone Ill call them R. J was the one who helped me through it. They were there when I needed someone the mostcomforting me, listening to me, encouraging me to get out. After I broke up with R, J and I got really close. We would talk every day, call every night, stay up late just talking about everything. There was some light flirting between us, and honestly, those moments made me feel so appreciated and seen. I started developing feelings for J, but I never said anything directly. I think they kind of knew based on how I acted, but I kept it to myself. At the time, J was single. Eventually, we had a falling out which was my faultI wont go into the details here, and we stopped talking for a few months. During that time, I had a dream about J that hit me harder than I expected. I missed them so much it actually hurt. But I was scared to reach out directly... so I did something really dumb: I catfished them. Yeah, I know. I was still dating R again at that point a big mistake, and I just wanted to talk to J again, even if they didnt know it was me. We talked for a few months under this fake identity. Then one night, during a blood moon weirdly enough, J called me. I answered, tried to disguise my voice, but they figured out it was me almost instantly. We talked, cleared things up a bit, and started reconnecting. But by this point, J had gotten into a new relationship. A few months into our renewed friendship, R and I broke up for good. Thats when everything came rushing back. I realized I never actually stopped liking JI just buried those feelings because I was with someone else. J has always meant so much to me. Theyre incredibly kind, caring, supportive they were my safe place when everything else in my life was falling apart. At some point, I confessed that I still had feelings for them. J said it was okay, that they werent upset. I started complimenting them moreprobably too muchand the compliments eventually turned into flirtation. J didnt seem to mind. In fact, they said they liked it and that it made them feel pretty and appreciated. Heres the hard part: J is still in a relationship. From what I understand, the relationship is complicated. Its romantic but not sexual, and while J does love their partner, theyve said its not in every way. There are some things they cant really talk about with me, but theyve mentioned feeling kind of stuck. Lately, Ive felt like maybe the feelings are mutual. I asked J directly if they liked me, and they said they didnt knowthey werent sure. But I cant stop thinking about them. Literally every morning, every nighttheyre always on my mind. Ive tried dating other people, tried distracting myself, but no one feels like J. Im going to see them soon, and I have no idea how Im supposed to act or what to do. I dont want to be the reason their relationship ends, if it ever does. I want it to happen naturally if its going to happen. But deep down, I just want to be with them. I want to hold their hand and tell them how much they mean to me, but I also want to respect their situation. I dont know what to do. Has anyone been through something like this? How do I move forward when I feel so stuck on someone who might never be mine?",

    "title": "How can I 19M fix my relationship with my gf? 18F",
    "text": "I dont even know where to begin, I am sorry if the post gets a little long, so I 19M have been in a relationship with my beautiful girlfriend18F for 1.5 years now, its really not one of those toxic teen relationships and we both are committed, I fell in love with this girl hard, extremely head over heels type stuff when I was 17, maybe its a bit young to commit to something but I truly dont know. For context we started off seeing each other basically every day but then it turned into a long distance relationship due to college. Going into the relationship, I thought I could finally have someone to talk about my emotions to, to express myself to because growing up I always felt misunderstood by my mother, my older brother was dealing with stuff of his own and he did all he could to be there for me, and my dad passed away when I was quite young. So I never really had someone to talk to, in my head getting a partner was something that could fulfil that need of being able to express myself truly, and I did tell her all my feelings, all my problems, everything I wasnt comfortable with. But every single time Ive decided to express myself since the start of this relationship, Ive felt that it always somehow got turned onto me and I was the one saying sorry in the end for talking about the stuff in my mind, it always became the same loop of I say something but by the end I have to console her and make her feel better, so slowly I stopped expressing myself because it was never good for me, the outcome was always the same and I never could gather the courage and energy to deal with it, I even stopped talking about the problems I had with our relationship, nothing extreme just small things. And at this point, I dont know what to do, I never talk about those things to any of my friends because I feel like that would be disrespectful in a way to my partner. I dont even feel like I want to go into the details about everything because I dont want to disrespect her even a tiny bit, its small things that slowly grew because I never brought them up, at this point, I really dont even know what my girlfriend does the entire day, or what is coming up in her life, where shes going or what her plans are like, while earlier it used to be like we talked about every single thing and now I feel like she doesnt even tell me anything unless I explicitly ask for every little detail, on the contrary, I used to tell her everything but she completely stopped showing interest in my life decisions such as which college Id be joining, which I feel like is a big decision of my life considering academics is a huge part of who I am, shes completely disinterested in any conversation related to it simply because I wont be joining the college she is in, I took that decision because I really dont want to sacrifice my academics and future for anything. Other than earlier we used to text each other whenever we could but now a lot of the times its like shes active on social media but doesnt text me which feels weird. I cant control her nor do I want to so I dont think its my place to complain about it, but its the things like her doing weed when I had told her I wont be comfortable with that, again I cant control her but its fine. I also feels like she sometimes acts like a hypocrite, she gets extremely weird and non-verbal whenever I bring up even the topic of hanging out with my school friends, or giving my friendF a gift for her birthday, she gets extremely interrogative, and its not like she doesnt trust my friends, heck I made sure that my good friends should be on good terms with her and she trusts everyone, but even if I go to a concert with my cousin and her friends, she became extremely weird about it again, while Ive never had a problem with her hanging out with anyone because I trust her and her friends, she invited her friendM over for hanging out and Im chill with it because I know for a fact that theyre just friends and I trust them. But it just feels weird because due to her acting so awfully about it I cancelled plans with my friend thrice and just gave up on hanging out with her. She acts like a hypocrite in many other situations and her acting so awfully and becoming non verbal in situations has made me give up so many things, which I never had a problem with because I was in love with her and would do anything for her, but now I dont even know whats going on in her life and she doesnt even care about whats going on in mine. I have had a lot of small issues in this relationship that I just stopped bringing up because she would simply never change them and just make me feel bad about it, all she ever did was say sorry a lot and then go back to what it was like earlier, she has never changed a thing from her side while I feel like I have completely changed who I am as a person if she ever felt even the slightest bit uncomfortable with anything. tldr- Been with my GF 1.5 yrs, LDR now. Thought I could talk about my feelings with her, but every time I do, I end up comforting her and apologizing. So I stopped sharing stuff, even small issues in our relationship. Now I feel distant, dont know whats going on in her life, and she doesnt care about whats going on in mind. Feels like shes a hypocrite and Ive given up on a lot of things because of her reactions. I dont know what I can or should do. Need advice from you guys, do relationships get better? Will I ever be able to talk openly? Whats wrong and how can I fix it? is there something fundamentally wrong with me? Will the cycle of me bottling up my emotions, putting on a fake smile, and just bearing everything continue?",

    "text": "I interviewed at another company recently and got offered a new job it wouldve been a step up and paid over 20k more a year 25 more. When I told my current company about it, they asked me to stay, saying they value me and that there would be promotion opportunities down the line. They were so genuine and kind about it, and honestly, I wasnt totally sure I was ready for that next role anyway, even though I know I could do it. So I decided to stay. Now Im starting to wonder if I made the wrong call. The money wouldve made a big difference, and I think I could probably still get that offer back. I just cant decide. I really like the people here, Ive got a strong network, and I feel respected but part of me keeps thinking I mightve passed up a big opportunity.",

    "text": "i 21f have lived with my parents my entire life. this was a decision i made when i started college, as i got a scholarship and, if i lived at home instead of on campus, i would not have to pay anything. this arrangement worked out fine for the majority of my education because i did not have much of a lifei did not make good friends until the last two years of school, and thus wasnt going out much. however, recently, it has become a major issue. the last few months living with my parents has been rather difficult. they found out i was gay a few months ago, and while theyre trying to understand, it has caused a major rift between us. i also have spent far more time out of the house in the last year, as i finally have friends and a partner. my parents give me an ever changing curfewthey will ask me to be home anywhere between 5pm and 8pm on weeknights, and usually 12am on weekends. when i get frustrated with these rules, they get angry with me, and we seem to be constantly arguing. i understand i chose to live here, but now i am starting to feel trappedwhen i mention moving they get upset, and recently have started trying to scare me into feeling like i wont be able to afford anything if i move out. i have always been a good kid, i help with chores, i have a job, i graduated with a 3.9, i dont do drugs and rarely drink. i want to move out, and my intention was to stay in my hometown and work for a year before going to graduate school. now, my parents are saying that it would be stupid of me to move out and spend money on rent if i want to go to graduate school. im just frustrated because on one hand i would love to be able to save as much money as possible, but on the other hand im tired of feeling like a child, constantly fighting, and having very little freedom despite my age. should i ignore their complaints and move out anyways? i feel like staying here is detrimental to my mental health because but i am also terrified about money, even though i have a lot of savings and intend to save as much as i can while working.",

    "text": "Tw: incest So I found out I always noticed that my friend and her sister looked too alike the resemblance was uncanny but I never thought much of it, one day we were out with our friendgroup conspired of 6 people, and we always had a spot wed meet up at it was a abandoned vintage diner that we cleaned up to look brand new. So on a random Tuesday my friend chase says lets play truth or dare/spin the bottle so we play. And it lands on my best friend who we are gonna call Candice and Me and I asked Candice truth or dare? She told me truth and I told her randomly because the 3 minute think of a question time was up, jokingly how Olds your mom, it was very random and she told me 32 which was odd to me because I added up the numbers 32 - 16 16, so her mother had her at 16 okay and then I told her if your moms 32 then why does she look way older, and then she told me the person whom we saw every time we went to her place was in fact not her mother but her step mother which we all found suspicious. an hour later Candice leaves and me and my friends are together and then we said that woman who was 32 aka Candices mother we are gonna call Jaime told us the woman that Candice called her step mother was actually jamies mother. So we put the pieces together and Candices Dad has had affairs with his daughter and wife, and Candice was a result of the affair he had with her sister. But Candice doesnt know this so how do we break the news to her .",
