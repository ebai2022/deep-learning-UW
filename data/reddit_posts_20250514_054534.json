Due to her being in an abusive relationship before me she is a very, dont touch me type of person. I on the other hand though can be kind of clingy. She doesnt like cuddles in bed, doesnt like hugs, and well, as far from me on the couch as she can. I on the other hand love doing hugs and cuddles in bed and would like to sit as close to her as I can. We have been together for three years and I know it takes time to heal from that stuff. I dont blame her on that at all, but she still hasnt come around to any of it. Ive tried talking to her about it she tries for a couple days then it back to the same of dont touch me. I love her and dont want to break up our family. What are your thoughts on how I should handle things?",

    "title": "HOA says we cant live in our rental wifes devastated, Im about to leave for military training.",
    "text": "We just moved into a townhome 2 minutes from my work its our first place together, and a huge upgrade after driving over an hour each way. We found it on Zillow and signed a 12-month lease with a very nice landlord couple. The lease clearly says neither party can terminate early. But during the move-in, my wife and her grandmother were approached on two separate occasions by women from the neighborhood who were extremely rude explaining they didnt know we could rent here I found this odd. Then on Mothers Day day after moving in, the HOA president came to the door. He was polite, but told us in no uncertain terms that our landlord wasnt supposed to rent and that theyre taking legal action against him. He said in nice terms that well have to leave and that the HOA is going to fine him into oblivion. The HOA has a rental cap of 10 and a waiting list. We knew none of this. I called the landlord and he told me he does have a valid rental permit from the HOA, and that theyre harassing him and refusing to acknowledge it. From what I can tell, the HOA president and landlord are absolutely not on good terms. Landlord has told me he is retaining counsel. This home is not cheap were paying 3,500/month, and we just want to live here, pay rent, and be left alone. My wifes been crying non-stop this is the exact area shes always wanted to live in, and now we feel like were being pushed out for no reason. We feel like pariahs in this new place where we were hoping to make friends and get involved in the community. To make things more complicated: Im a commissioned officer in the National Guard and Im leaving for Title 32 orders for a month-long training cycle. Im worried about my wife being approached or harassed while Im away. Were a mid-20s couple, and most of the neighborhood seems older we havent exactly been welcomed. In fact, every interaction we have had in the first 48 hours has been rude. Im also a law school grad sitting for the July 2025 bar. Ive already consulted my legal counsel but we are essentially in a holding pattern until the HOA or landlord takes action against us. Were lawful tenants, not in privity with the HOA, and just want to stay and get on with our lives. My question is how would you handle the HOA, landlord etc. if you had to leave your SO alone? Im worried they will cut off the trash or shut off her key fob to the community pool while Im away. Honestly, we are normal people who follow the rules and this is just a wild situation. Further note, not many rentals in this location bc this area is popular. Would have to move quite a bit of ways out of town. Location: GA",

    "text": "My BF 28M went on a trip to visit his mom for a week. Over the phone, I 28F could sense he was sad, but he insisted the trip was fine. When he got back, I asked again, and he said it went well. Two days later at dinner, he suddenly said, I have a secret to tell you, but if you ever tell anyone, Ill break up with you. The secret wasnt about me or us it was something personal with his family. I was shocked because hes never threatened to leave me before. He said it clearly and repeated it three times. It really hurt. Weve been together 3.5 years, and it made me feel disposable and like he didnt trust me at all. When I told him how I felt, he claimed I misunderstood and that he just wanted me to know how important the secret was. But to me, it felt like gaslighting hed already said very clearly hed break up with me without hesitation THREE times. I love him, but Im seriously questioning the relationship now. How do I handle a situation where someone I love threatens the relationship like this over something unrelated to us?",

    "text": "So I am in a 2 year long distance relationship with my partner ever since third year of my college and ever since weve gone through several ups and downs together however in our 4th year we both decided to study for a competitive exam together, due to the job offers and placements going on in our college we couldnt give it our 100 effort but did our best, I had a pressure of getting a job from our home so I got one thankfully after some effort, but the thing is our college isnt that good and Im not satisfied with my current job and thats why I started studying for that competitive exam so that I can get into any of the best colleges in my country for Masters and get an amazing job offer. However I may have been putting up a lot of effort but shes not as serious anymore as she used to be before about this although she says that we have to be more serious but she doesnt show it in action. Previous year when we were in our respective homes during the winter break, we both were in the long distance so we used to have google meet in the night, it used to start at maybe 12 and we used to stay awake till 4 or sometimes even 4:40 in the morning, I remember one time the maximum time we were in meet till 5:20 AM and this greatly disturbed my schedule, I used to always be tired but still give my 200 effort everyday because I woke up late around 11:30 or sometimes even 12 AM everyday and it disturbed me so much I dont know why, however whenever Id talk about going to sleep early she would always agree however when in the meet Id say lets sleep its getting late she would get angry and upset and think I didnt love her and didnt want to spend time with her. Except for the meet we also used to text in the morning and sometimes even have a 1 or 2 hour meet during the day which greatly reduced the time I could study and left me even more disturbed. Shes a nice person and loves me so much however she cant seem to change this thing which is be disciplined for this exam because we both are still preparing for it, this year we both have our first attempt and I barely qualified but she performed very poorly and was disappointed. Yesterday we also had a talk about this and she says we have to be serious but she cant when the time actually comes. Can anyone more experienced give me any suggestions on what can be done to solve this problem?",

    "title": "Rejected again-losing hope",
    "text": "I 37F have been struggling trying to figure out what I want went it comes to my love life due to all of the rejections Ive received. Im losing faith that I will never find love I apologize for how long this is but Im tired of being rejected and I need advice on what it is Im doing wrong I am extremely shy and guarded and insecure so its a struggle for me but People say put yourself out there so I try to be myself and be honest but none of my love interests last more than a month and Im starting to wonder if theres something wrong with me? Here are some issues that I face when being open and honest Experience- Ive had a lot of trauma in my life. I wasnt allowed to date until I was 16yrs old and I respected my mother enough to listen to that rule. She ended up passing when I was 16 so I didnt end up dating. The loss of her was to much to focus on men or boys. I never got to experience high school love. By the time I was ready to date which was around 18 I put myself out there but not as much. I would go on small dates here and there but nothing long term until I met this guy via MySpace and allowed myself to get catfished for almost 3yrs. Never do that its not worth your time. This made my sexual experience physically non existent but we would sext so I was open to exploring my sexuality. I was finally able to wake up from the fantasy of him and had a few flings but I was shy when it came to sex because I was 22 with no sexual experience. I was sexually physical with two men but it never went further than 3rd base and I stayed a virgin until I was 24 because I was waiting for someone special. I felt worthy that no man touched me for that long, I was proud and never ashamed but I noticed that the men I told always had an issue with it so it took longer for me to find the right partner but I knew my worth and was not going to settle. Heres where it all went down hill I never lost my virginity it was taken against my will by a coworker I thought I trusted and confided in. He date raped me one night I was celebrating my promotion. To say that i didnt trust being near men after that is an understatement. It destroyed my self worth I stopped dating for a year. I decided to stay celibate again until I found the right person but I was lonely so I changed my mind and lost my revirginity to a friend I didnt enjoy the experience at all so it was a one night stand with a friend. We never had sex again. I became celibate again and met someone who made me feel so much attraction like I couldnt resist him. No one ever made me feel that way before and I was so sexually attracted to him but he sensed I was inexperienced and I felt like he was not interested in me enough long term so I ended things when he couldnt answer what he wanted between us after a month of dating. We never had sex I wanted to be sure. I was 26 by that time. I was so lonely but I still didnt give up putting myself out there. The trauma of the rape took a toll on me by this time. I started being wreckless and drinking and I was lonely. I wont get into much detail but I had 3 sexual experiences with strangers and only once. Im mortified to say this but Ive literally only had sex 4 times and was raped once. I have no other physical sexual experiences. Most of the time I just watch porn or sext online. Im now celibate another 5yrs. Ive tried not telling men because Im not an open book and Ive also tried telling them. Ive tried casual sex its not for me obviously. Ive tried the opposite sex Im not sexually attracted to them. Ive tried being honest and said I want long term. No one I speak with is looking for that or they gaslight me into thinking they want the same and go radio silent after really getting to know me. No good male role models- I was molested as a child and my father is a dead beat. Ive dated all different types of men but I dont know what a real man looks like. All of the male role models in my life arent great examples to base a romantics connection off of. I dont really have many male friend for traumatic reasons. I struggle with my self worth and value. I dont feel worthy of love. I feel extremely tainted and I dont value myself sometimes. Im getting better now but as soon as I put myself out there again I keep getting the same result. How I carry myself I feel like I give off this aura of damaged goods and sexual deviant and those are the men that gravitate toward me. Id like to believe I am very attractive so Im constantly over sexualized which makes me feel disgusted. Lastly I dont know what I want- I just know what I dont. I wrote down all the qualities and things I want in someone but since Im losing faith that will never happen for me. Im slowly contemplating whether I should just settle. I think sometime I should just meet someone and just have sex with no emotions or attachment but I know deep down this isnt what I want. I know I want a deep connection and friendship that leads to love I am a sexual person but I want to have sex with the right person and idk what to do anymore I need help",

    "text": "Im a 45yr old homeless addict, that lives in Daytona Beach FL. Ive been homeless for 8 yrs ,after a 17yr relationship falling apart. Can anyone tell me why our 711 Convience stores, and Sunocos think its ok to close the restrooms insides the stores. First, there has to be some type of big violation with a closed bathroom when the store servers food. Pretty sure they have to have a restroom for the customers to use. See we have a lot of homeless addicts that they want to blame for making the bathroom50,000 for someone overdosing in the bathroom? Because someone must have and ever since then, they have decided to completely close the bathroom , Out of Order and its never been fixed, well where do the employees use the restrooms? OurLocation:nd Sunocos are owned by the Patels, no bs, and the own 25 I think of those stores in Volusia county. Well they hate homeless Americans mainly and discriminate in so many ways I d like to find a way to take big action considering the homeless and locals keep their business going when season is over. Pretty much 1 a day/ 356yr. What store can u say u consecutively spend money with like that? And the are rude and need to be taught how to treat people in this country,! In other words I need to figure out a way to take action against discrimination and cleanliness of these stores! See today is my Fathers birthday, and when I was a little girl he worked at one. I remember how he was with his customers, still to this day the customer would always be right in his eyes Unfortunately now if we do anything they think is wrong, they threaten call cops and have us tresspassed. God forbid we try to smoke a cigarette with a cup coffee we just bought and then leave .that is forbidden, especially if theyve labeled you as a homeless drug addict. What steps can I take to stick it to the 711/Sunoco Patels that come here and we give them money to have these businesses started, dont think they have to pay taxes for 7 years, and then transfer it to another family member to avoid paying them longer Driving Hummers and Mazarati Suvs, trying to charge 15cents for creamers. During events, bike week spring break, ect.. they pick and choose who can use the bathroom I literally can show you pictures of 5 stores with no bathrooms. They to be fined and punished, and its really messed up about how these people have come into our ckountryists and treat Americans like crap.. I want to make sure they pay for discrimination for being judgemental aholes... Please help me make them treat everyone the same and have place to use a restroom inside anytime Especially since Im not trying to to jail imDB for getting caught using the bathroom outside.

    "text": "I wanted to start this off by saying that this is my first time coming to Reddit about anything so please bear with me. I have been with my partner for a year and 6 months now and everything has been fine. Weve had our issues, just as every relationship has, but weve always managed to overcome them so far. When it comes to trusting my partner, I want to say that I do and he has never given me any reason whatsoever to believe that my trust has been misplaced. An issue happened recently, though, where I was upset with him about us not talking much while he was away on a trip. Because I live with my family, they noticed my emotional state and questioned why I was upset. To make that a long story short, I told them we hadnt talked much since he left and they asked me if he was cheating on me. The issue with that is that my family has always believed that ALL men are liars/cheaters solely because of their experiences with them and thats what I grew up with. Despite my belief that thats not true, theres still that small voice that rings in the back of my head that tries to doubt said belief. Ive also talked with my partner about this before and told him that its not because of him that I have these thoughts and that I am working to try to overcome these worries, but Im still struggling in that department. I would also like to add that I have no personal experience with being cheated on because all of the partners Ive had before him have never done that to me. I just want to know what I can do to overcome these worries that I have about being cheated on.",

    "title": "My girlfriend wants to explore sex with others... Point break?",
    "text": "My gf 29F and I 32M are together since a bit more than 4 years now. Our story is amazing and I believe unique. We met while I was traveling in South America, we connected very quickly, and never split except a few times, Ive been leaving for a week or two for work, and one time 3 months also for work. Were living in Spain since 2.5 years now, it hasnt been easy everyday, mainly because its a foreign country for both of us, but we always have been supportive and understanding to each other and were starting to make good money now. I really believe shes my everything. We always talk about everything without filters, with no judgement, and I feel so good with her. Im not saying everything is perfect, of course things are going on through life. But the very few fights we had in those 4 years were really small and always easy to clear out. Ive never doubted about our relationship.... until last week. And it hurts. Last week, we had a little dispute about something stupid doesnt even matter what it was. And I feel it has been the switch... She decided to take some distance, to take time for herself. But she didnt explained her feelings, she didnt say anything but I dont know what to think. I was in a very bad mental state during these few days. First because I felt it was out of nowhere, second because I had no explanation, and third because I thought she wasnt giving a shit about the way I felt, and I felt abandoned... I mean, to be able to bury a beautiful 4 years relationship with someone you say you love like never before that quick, you got to be decided.... Dont you think?... After a few days, she decided to sit and talk. So I listened... Long story short, she told me that she feels like were not connected like we used to. She feels lost and doesnt really know what shes looking for. When I asked her if shes still in love, she answered its different... After explaining it because of the routine we have here not a bad one, each of us has a job, we have a nice apartment nearby the beach, were comfortable, she told me also the things I should improve chores mainly, and, massive hammer: she would like to explore her sexual desires with other people... Just to clarify, about sex, were both good on it. We have a great sexual complicity, we have sex 2-4 times/week, and always satisfied of course, there are some sessions better than others, but all in all, its great on both sides, no doubt about it. We have no shame sharing our desires or fantasies, give tries on new things... But this, I dont know... I understand her curiosity in some ways. She only had 3 partners in her whole life and I know shes a bit curious about women too. And Im ok about it, if we talk and settle the limits together... I just feels it puts me in a position that, if I want to be with her, I got to accept no matter what. Of course, this would let me have sex with other people too, but honestly, even if it can be good and exciting on the moment, I dont even want to. I still feel connected to her, and Im not attracted to any other woman... Also important: I trust her and I believe her. I mean, I am sure she is not hiding a lover or having already something planned in mind. As I said, we tell each other everything, even if it has to be painful. I know she would tell me, even if shed feel bad about it. At the end, as I am leaving very soon for 10 weeks for work, we said wed take time for individual thoughts, with no expectations for the future and enjoying our personal time. If we have to meet again, life will put us on the same path... But during those 10 weeks, I am afraid of that: - Her having sex with other people and not coming back: that would be painful but at least clear. - Her having sex with other people and coming back: she didnt find any better, she realizes it was dumb... But Id feel like being the emergency wheel... - Me. I think Id be able to have sex with someone else only if my mind is free from her. And if it is, its because I turned the page. But I dont want to turn that fucking page... I think shes passing through some kind of existential crisis, where she needs to take control back on her life. She started this new job a couple months ago, its going well, but it may have been a bit stressful for her... At the end, I dont know what to think/do/expect... I want to be with her, really, shes the one I love and enjoy to spend time with and I know she is still very attached to us. But I feel like, just by accepting her request, theres no chance. What would you do? What do you think about this situation? TLDR my girlfriend is hesitant about our relationship and wants to explore her desires with other people. Thanks for your reading and thoughts.",

    "text": "Warning: SA reference Ive been with my GF for over a year now. Full disclosure, Ive had a pretty bad life until now poverty, parental drug abuse but truly put my head down and got a really good job where I dont have to worry about money. I helped my GF with work and strategizing in a corporate world and increased her salary by over 30k in one year. So collectively, we are doing well. I try to be the best boyfriend I possibly can be. We dont live together but we share the cooking and cleaning when visiting each other etc etc. We have both been fully invested and she has been perfect for me until now. We had even talked about trying for children soon since neither of us are getting younger. She had hinted that she suffered a SA from a previous boyfriend and I told her I fully understood and we could take things as slow as she wanted. Ive never pushed for sex and told her that when shes ready - Im ready too. In over a year we have had sex once. Thats not an issue for me but she always seems to tell me shes ready but its on the horizon. Her period comes early or shes feeling unwell and then it passes until she brings it up again. We tried once and she just lay with legs down and I physically couldnt enter her. I chalked it up to the possible SA and reassured her it was okay and we can try in future when she feels like it. We then tried again successfully but she became sore after a few seconds so I immediately stopped. That is one thing. I found out recently that this ex BF who she hinted had SAd her still contacts her mother on her mothers bday etc and it seems they are on perfectly fine terms which was odd to me. I was also on her iPad and saw Instagrams frequently contacted with men on it. I asked who the men where and she said it was her Mothers account that was logged in and it was men her mother was talking to. She then deleted Instagram on the iPad. I discovered that she actually has two separate Instagram accounts with a totally different persons photo on one - again, I chalked it up to her wanting to hide certain things from this apparent abusive ex. A few days ago, I feel like her mask slipped slightly. She was stressed about work and had to attend a meeting. She got kind of snappy at me and I said Is this what itl be like every time you have this meeting?. That was enough for her to really flip and turn absolutely stone cold toward me. She called me a liar, said that I was egotistical and all these things I had never heard from her before. When I asked her if she believed them she turned it saying that all you care about is yourself. Im completely lost on how to deal with this and move forward. Shes never outright said she was SAd - just hinted something had happened. Im generally very happy with our relationship but this really threw me. I dont know if I am being a totally horrible bf or if Im being taken for a fool. How would you handle this? Ive tried talking to her and it generally comes back to me having said or done something that caused all this. I feel Ive been so understanding and rightfully should be as her bf.",

I have a question for a research project: If there was a website that included everything you need regarding exercise, both inside and outside gym, running, cycling, boxing, etc., would you use it? If so, what would be a feature you would really want to see on that website? Please also mention for which sport you would use it. Thank you very much for your input! Maybe some of you can help me find the correct place to post this question if this isnt the best spot?",

She was my high school crush and I still had feelings for her in college and even post grad but I always felt like she was way way way out of my league. But she miraculously reached out to me late last year and we started dating and it has felt like a fairy tale since then. Shes funny, beautiful, has similar interests, and balances out my introversion with her extroversion in a way that has really made my life much more fulfilling. Ive experienced and done things I would have never done before thanks to her. Shes even helped me strengthen my own friendships. We entered this relationship with an understanding that I may get into medical school and it probably will be far away. Now that point has come and we are both feeling really bummed and excited about it. I wish I had the courage to ask her out years ago so that we could have had more time together Any advice on how we can navigate this and keep our relationship strong?",

    "text": "So a little background on my relationship, I been with my boyfriend for about a year in a half. We havent had any issues we been great together. As of a few months ago I found out he has been watching porn and looking at explicit pictures of woman on social media. The first time I seen anything I was in bed turned away from him and I was on my phone and I could see his phone in my phones reflection it caught my eye for a second. He was picking on every picture with girls with big asses and just very explicit pictures. My heart broke. I purposefully moved a little too see if he would clear it he did. I didnt speak to him the rest of the night. He tried getting me to talk and was saying you know Im so lucky to have you etc. Even though he didnt know what I seen. The next day I explained what I seen and expressed how I felt about it and he listened and understood it seemed. I didnt sleep in the same bed as him for a couple days. He knew in the beginning of the relationship that I couldnt be with someone watching porn or anything like that. He also followed a chick that he slept with once a few days later. I asked why he did he said it just popped up on recommended friends but we talked about this before about me not wanting him to have her on anything and he blocked her on snapchat but then 6 months later follows her. He did end up blocking her after I said something again. Some weeks go by and by this time hes made sure that no pictures pop up on instagram or tiktok he put sensitive content on to show less and hits see less if something pops up once in a while. Hes expressed he only wants me. A month goes by and I found he looked up porn while he was out doing things. I confronted him and expressed and explained again how I felt. I said I need some space. He ended up taking a few days to think and try and understand my point of view he ends up crying and saying he dont want me to leave him. I told him I dont want too but if this keeps happening I just cant be with someone addicted to that. It makes me insecure feel unworthy and not truly wanted. Its been a few months since everything happened after about like 6 deep conversations about it too him and me expressing how hurt I still am by it, he hasnt looked at anything that I know of. Its just really hard to trust him fully again and now it makes me overthink a lot. Like him even just being in the bathroom for a little or him being at work. I feel like hes gonna watch it or look at other woman. Before all this happened I never had these thoughts and it just sucks because I want him to actually stop and understand but I dont know if he actually does. I just wish he would show me more how much I mean to him and for him to show hes really trying which he said he will prove. I showed him some youtube vids to help with porn addiction and he watched a couple but I dont think hes watched them in a while now. Im just scared hes gonna end up looking at stuff again because I dont know if I can handle that pain again. I just wish I could trust him fully again and not feel insecure. Funny thing is hes the one that brought back my security in myself but now its broken again.",

    "text": "Well, this is my first post ever to Reddit, Im looking for some advice of how I should proceed. Please be mindful. I feel like there isnt a way for me to talk about anything intimacy or sexual without feeling like an ahole but Im going to give it my best shot, I need to get this off my chest and explore options of what I can do besides breaking up. My 23M girlfriend 20F have been dating for 9 months, and off the top she told me that there might not ever be sex. I know relationships are more than just that and decided to look past that. Shes the most beautiful, funny, all around amazing girl I have ever met and the first Ive ever actually been able to experience falling in love with. Shes in school and Im not, I work full time and we still make it work even when we cant see each other for a month at a time. Fast forward a few months of being together and we love making out with each other, and she on multiple occasions allowed me to go down on her with her permission before I did anything. When we went on a trip together she even got in the shower with me in the hotel room once. Ive always respected her boundaries when she tells me them. Well, come the turn of 2025, she said she didnt want anything like that for a while. Of course I refrained from making any unwanted advances. Our relationship just turned 9 months and I cant help but feel like theres just a lack of intimacy, and that makes me question myself as if theres something wrong with me no matter how much she insists theres not. Ive tried doing stuff for her and she never has tried to do anything more than just kiss with me. Last night on the phone she told me that she wont ever do anything for or with me sexually, sex or otherwise, and I know shes not the type to be in support of having an open relationship NOR would I want to do anything with anyone else other than her. Ive asked her if she was asexual before, she said no, and Ive asked her if shes sexually attracted to me and she said she is, I just feel like she left me in a gray area of not knowing what the hell is going on for over 6 months of our relationship. I feel like theres no compromise on her end, I dont want her to do something she doesnt want to or is repulsed by but she basically just gave me the terms of yeah, for as long as youre with me youll never do anything sexual other than yourself again. I told her that on both ends we need to work on communicating better with each other. I just dont know what to do or say, I just wish she would give me more understanding shes not giving. Ive thought of couples counseling or just sucking it up and accepting it and doing nothing but the latter doesnt seem fair. She doesnt feel that its fair to me either, I just wish we had some compromise or wiggle room in some way to make it work. If I was just in it for sex I wouldnt have stayed with her for 9 months of nothing beyond kissing or what Ive done for her months back and stopped upon request. Anybody have any advice OTHER THAN breaking up that I can use? Its a tough situation and I dont mean to explain it poorly, I dont really know how to properly explain it. I love this girl more than anything and dont want to not have her in my life, weve known each other for a couple years and even talk about living our lives together when shes done with school.",
