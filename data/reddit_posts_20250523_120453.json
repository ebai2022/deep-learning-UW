Todays the day we were supposed to go, but I noticed he edited the original message to say wed meet there instead of him picking me upwithout telling me. Communications been confusing: he once went silent during a call and didnt explain why, and he didnt follow through on calling me when he said he would. He hasnt confirmed our plan today or messaged me at all. I dont feel comfortable going, but Im unsure how to cancel without seeming rude or leading him on. My family suggests ghosting, but that doesnt sit right with me. I just want to back out kindly and end things without implying future plans. What would be suggested? Or do you agree with my family?. If this isnt the right community to post this in please do not downvote and instead let me know so that I can take it down",

While still in school preparing for graduation I wanted to do a gap year, work in a field that potentially might be what I want to study in university and after that enroll in university. By talking with family I got convinced that I would waste my time doing so, so I spent two months working part-time while waiting to start uni. So now Im here, in my second semester and I still cant shake this feeling of why didnt you choose the gap year and idk what to do. On one hand I know its because Im in a shitty place right know where Im at uni all week and working at the weekends, so I barely get rest and my social life and free time are taking hits. On the other hand I also know its because Im sort of jealous of people getting to do a gap year and collecting experience and getting to know different people. I feel like Im stuck currently, but Im scared of dropping out, cause then I would be back at square one trying to decide what to do with my life with pressure from my family. And if Id decide to do a gap year after my bachelor, cause I would only be 23/24 years old at that point, Im scared it could impact my career entry. That I wouldnt find a job after a year of having my degree. I lowkey just feel like Im wasting time no matter what I do.",

    "text": "So, it was me and my partners anniversary, and we decided to go out to eat at a home-style place. My partner went in the past, and she said it was really good. Here is the laundry list of issues that happened, going from most tame to most messed up. - Not as much of an issue, but to give you an idea, we got a wrap side, a one piece fish and chips size, and a half pound of calamari. It was 70. Shouldve made us leave, but didnt -Both the calamari our poutines sides were cold, but at least cooked to give you an idea, the gravy was solid in chunks. - They had a list of the ingredients on the menu of what came on the wrap. Half the ingredients were wrong, diff veggies, no cheese, diff sauce. -My partners fish was both undercooked and was filled with grease. She took two bites before mentioning it to the server. -When they server manager came to investigate the fish, they took her plate, used bare hands that were just previously handling money we saw, and picked through the fish. -Manager called the owner, seeing if they could give my partner a refund, the manager was YELLING in the dining room that it was perfect again, undercooked, mushy, and layered in grease and that it was suppose to be oily because it was cooked in fat. She then directed her yelling to my partner and told her that it was too bad. Did not get refund. -They took her food the fish the upcharged side and threw it out without asking us. Again, only 2 or 3 bites were taken, and they refused to give us a refund because it was perfect. Didnt offer to fix it either. -Now, about an hour later, my partner is sick / nauseous. Currently unsure if thats because of the massive bite of grease that she got, or because the fish gave her mild food poisoning. I really dont know what to do in this situation. For context, were Canadian, so dont know if theyre any legal grounds we may have, especially regarding them taking her food and throwing it out without her consent she was still going to eat the cold poutine, but I guess not. Any and all advice is appreciated. Were both pissed off, and just want some resolution.",
