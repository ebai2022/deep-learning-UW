    "text": "My boyfriend and I, both 27, have been together since we were 22 and live together. Things were truly chemical when we first got together. We fell in love very fast, and really I felt like I was dating my best friend because we had such strongly overlapping interests. For the first few years together, we did most things togetherwe both were very into rock climbing and running, and casually played volleyball on the side. We also both liked going to concerts, camping, and making art, and would do both of those things together a lot. As time has gone on, hes gotten more and more into this specific club sport of which hes a team captain. He loves it and often is occupied with it most of the weekends and a couple week nights per week. He has dropped climbing, art, and volleyball pretty much altogether. He doesnt really like going to concerts much anymore, and his music taste has started diverging more from mine such that he rarely wants to go to concerts with me now. He also takes a lot of convincing to go camping, and hes busy with his club team most weekends anyways. I also am a lot more social than him generally and like to get out with people a lot more. I feel like we dont spend that much time together these days, and dont have so much to talk about anymore because our interests are so different. I still love him, but I no longer feel like were close in the way we once were. I still love him, but I am a bit worried that we are growing apart. Im not sure if this normal in a relationship, given how long weve been together. What to do?",

It took me a while to get over her, but I did, and began dating again. When that relationship ended my old feelings came back. I realized I never truly got over her, I accepted that we wouldnt date now, but still believed she would become my wife one day. I recognize how naive that is to feel at my age I realized recently that for her it wasnt a matter of it being the wrong time to date, she just doesnt find me attractive, and thats not going to magically change. I know I need to get over her, but I dont know how to do that while continuing to be her friend, especially because other people ship us all the time, or just assume we are already dating, I need to get over her, but losing her isnt an option for me. How can I get over her without ending our friendship?",

    "text": "Im currently a junior and the guy Im seeing is a senior in college right now. We started going out in November and became exclusive a few months ago. Hes not my boyfriend but he feels like he is and we spend a lot of time together. I love being around him and I have a lot of genuine feelings towards him. I think he feels the same about me. Hes by far the nicest and most supportive guy Ive been with and he makes me really happy. He says things that indicate he feels the same way and like he has a lot of genuine feelings towards me. I really like him and dont want to be with anyone else but hes about to graduate. For context, hes moving roughly 6 hours away by car for his job. Im going to graduate in December but will stay in my collegetown until next may. The city hes working in is my dream city to be in so there is a chance I will end up there but I really have no idea. I also might be there over the summer depending on if I get an internship I interviewed for. I already have an internship Im excited about at home 20 hour car ride from him but I might renege if I get the other one. Not sure what to do. Im so so sad about him leaving. Is it a bad idea to try long distance if I have no idea where I will be post-grad? I keep crying thinking about saying goodbye Ive never felt this way towards someone or been in this situation before. Ive had other relationships that felt very meaningful but if I knew guys like him existed I would have never dated the other people Ive gone out with one of whom I even believed I loved- this was senior year of high school",

    "title": "I think Im too selfish for a relationship",
    "text": "I think Im too selfish for a relationship Because I failed to see the little things 20M. Was in a relationship with my former partner 28F for a year and a half. Im schooling and shes working. Shes everything a guy would pray to have. intelligent, financially responsible, health-conscious, no tramp stamp, etc. I grew up with emotionally detached family and she is the first person I met who supported through the hardest parts of my life. Like all relationships, ours was wonderful and magical at first. I was deep in love with her. After the first year, we get into a lot of arguments as I messing up a lot of things and she was trying to steer me to the direction to growing up, that love feeling has dwindled again, as expected and for the past few months, we have been online and rare F2F. More and more I just feel annoyed and irritated with her as I feel everything she mentioned is a demand. I dont want to go on dates with her. I dread weekends because of the expectation that we spend that time together and go do something. At times I want to but the way we are just demotivates me. I began fearing and avoiding her. The past few months have intensified these feelings to the point where I think of little else. I end up letting her go. It hurts. She advised me to stay but In order for her to have a better life, I threw our ring away and deleted all our photos. We ended with a final call today when she says she always loved me. I have the similar feeling. I cant let her go either. But told her, for her sake... I am so selfish...I only want to do what I want and I get so irritated when I have to cater to her desires. Going to certain sights, stopping to eat at certain places, see her as a bunch of codes and rules to follow. I saw her as a demanding tyrant. But I am always present for her. Im just not facing her directly. I want to just do fun stuff together, to have fun, to talk about funny things, to have no animosity between us. To feel like a home together. Not to walk on eggshells. Even when I completely understand why she is doing all of this. I was in an awful place with a fling before her and she saved me from it. It breaks my heart to admit all of this. She is such a great person and deserves so much more than what Im giving her. currently finished therapy for her so we can both work on ourselves. but I dont know if these feelings will ever change. I just like to be alone 90 of the time. Most of the time Id be perfectly happy just doing yardwork, reading, or doing hobbies. Looking back, I think I initially started looking for a relationship because I was lonely. At that point in life, I lived alone and had no socialization outside of school. I started looking for a relationship when I think I probably shouldve just been looking for friends instead. Oh, and there is no other woman. The debate in my head isnt being with her vs being with someone else, its being with her vs being alone. I dont have much relationship experience, but Ive seen other peoples relationships and I know we have a pretty freaking good one. I just feel like Im not made for this. I made a list of pros/cons of the relationship and almost all of the pros were selfish reasons: having someone to talk to sometimes so I dont get lonely, having someone there when I get old, etc. Thank you for reading. My conversation last night with her broke her but we still love each other. How I wish I could have been her through the end...",

    "text": "Im 25 years old and currently studying at IIM, one of the top finance institutes. After graduation, Ill likely get an above-average placement. I had a decent physique about three years ago. I come from a loving, financially supportive family now. But from 1st to 12th standard, things were different. I was overweight, unattractive, and academically weak. My family faced financial struggles. During school, I had a crush on a girl lets say R who was both popular and a class topper. She was out of my league, and I knew she didnt think highly of me. Despite this, I had strong willpower. I tried to be funny and entertaining to be liked. I had a friend group of four girls and two boys. The girls were attractive and intelligent, and the boys had their own bond. I often felt excluded. My crush was part of that group, but I never got close to her. When I tried expressing interest, it was clear she wasnt interested. After 12th, I worked on improving myself. I started going to the gym and focused on studies, fashion, and communication. In engineering, I lost 30 kg, became more social, made good friends, and my familys financial condition improved. During the COVID lockdown, I doubled downworked on my fitness, skills, and social image. When college reopened, people noticed my transformation. I became a prominent part of my new group, which i made in engineering time. they dont know my past. I was a cool guy, and my classmates looked up to me. Later, I reconnected with my old school group and confessed my feelings to my old crush. She rejected me. I tried dating other girls but got rejected again. Even at my best, I couldnt attract anyone. That made me believe I lacked the qualities that attract people, no matter my efforts. So, I focused on academics, cleared a tough exam, and got into IIM. During preparation, I stopped exercising, gained weight again, and developed unhealthy habits like drinking alcohol, watching porn, scrolling, gaming, etc. Even though I have supportive IIM friends, I find it hard to engage with them. Ive lost motivation and willpower. I know the right pathlosing weight, focusing on academics, and building my careerbut Im stuck in unhealthy routines like watching porn, drinking, and gaming. Even if I transform again, I feel it wont change anything. My old crush has moved on, was in a relationship while I was working on myself, and I still dont feel that level of connection with anyone else. I remain a virgin, despite working hard on my body for years, while others achieve admired physiques with less effort. Academically, I study more but still get average results. It feels like I must put in significantly more effort just to reach the baseline, while others do well with minimal input. Even if I do everything right, people like my old crush will still choose others who seem naturally gifted.",

    "text": "Im am genuinely not sure exactly what I said I talk a lot to have triggered him, but I feel absolutely awful and Im not sure what to say to help him feel better. I have a tendency to say throw away phrases which I use as silence fillers when Im not sure exactly what to say as a response. We were talking today about general manners when it comes to spending money on other people, for example: I usually pay for lunch with my friends but recently gave up being annoyed at them for not offering to buy lunch on other times, Ive started to see it as gifts, and dont expect anything back. He disagrees and says he does expect friends to pay him back, out of courtesy. I agreed with him, but I came to the previous conclusion to give myself peace of mind. However this then lead on to a discussion of backgrounds, I have known since the beginning of our relationship that he grew up in poverty, and at no point has it ever been an awkward conversation for me. I grew up middle class, and have a good job now. This is the same for him, he has a good job now and can afford to treat himself and live a good life. Whenever we talk about his childhood, I find I say things like I feel like thats common though, no? When we talk about things like him and his childhood friends not being able to rely on parents for financial help. And also wait, really? When he mentioned how impoverished his neighbourhood was and that it was famous for it. I honestly didnt know that. Im not sure what exactly I said to hurt his feelings, but I know I did hurt them, as he expressed he thinks I dont listen to him and try to discredit his experience from the things I say. I have apologised profusely, and I feel absolutely awful for hurting his feelings unintentionally. Im not sure how to communicate now when the topic comes up again, as, and I mean this genuinely, I had no idea what I was replying was triggering. But this is my own naivety. Can anyone give me any advice on how to approach this topic respond, appropriately? I dont want him to think I dont care about his childhood, because I really do, and I adore him and dont want to make him uncomfortable. I have also said this to him, but hes cooling off and probably doesnt want to talk for a bit.",

    "text": "Social media has really affected me. I feel the need to search for opinions on everything, ask ChatGPT every question that comes to my mind, browse Reddit, and so on. Most of the time, when I do this, I end up reading things that shock me because people normalize things that seem strange. Im almost 18, its not that much, but Ive been through some things, so I think I know at least a little bit about whats good for me and Ive learned some boundaries. Even so, I cant live without checking what others think about every situation or whatever. I currently have a situation I can explain privately if someone is interested in sharing their view, and as I said, I think Im at an age where, even though I still have so much to learn, in some areas, I really know whats right and wrong for me. But Im scared of what people will think, and I constantly worry and search for opinions on the internet. : So my question is: How do you stop living other peoples lives? How do you stop caring about what people do or say? How do you focus only on yourself, and how do you live by your own rules without looking at others? I am genuinely sitting now and crying because I returned on tik tok and when I see what people normalise here I am in schock.",

We maybe go out to eat in a restaurant every so months but when we go out to do activities i dress up and try to look pretty but i will catch him looking away at people walking by mostly girls like one restaurant had a mirror behind me and he was facing it and i saw his eyes following a girl as i could see his eyes moving as she walks past. dont get me wrong she was beautiful like bow down to her but it got to me and that wasnt the first time its a recurring thing but maybe im just insecure we dont have sex like we used to either maybe once every two weeks which im okay with that likes its not a bad thing but its only when he initiates it when i try to do anything first hes like dont touch me and i could be just like cuddling him and my hand goes on his belly no where near his thing then last night he tries it and im like my family is in the room over i dont feel comfortable and then im like f it lets do it quick and his mood shifted a little bit not to much but then i am on top not seeing his face and he just is straight faced not into it and i immediately stoped and asked whats wrong and he said he just isnt in the mood anymore and i feel some type of way because he felt like he couldnt express that to me and i have no idea what the immediate switch up was because he was the one who pursued it and did half of the work and he kept going till i pushed him away because im not gonna force him to do something hes not in the mood for because thats wrong. i dont know i just feel like something has to do with me and im just not the same person he used to be attracted to",

Then our child asked dad where is the earrings u got for mom. Husband denied he got me an earring and he said he doesnt know why he would lie. I dont think our child would lie. And child even showed us where he supposed to hid it but of course its not there anymore. Mother in law died a long time ago and he has a brother. He insisted that our child lied. I even had a heart to heart talk to my child without him and he really insisted dad bought that",

    "title": "I accidentally revealed feelings to a colleague. She got closer, then turned cold. 25M/35F",
    "text": "Im a junior 25M, and she was a manager 35F in my department. At first, we just talked casually a few times in the office, in the elevator. It started when she offered to help me with work that wasnt even her responsibility. Before the New Year holiday, I accidentally sent her a message meant for my friend. It was about her. I wrote something like: Today I asked her if I could text her just to annoy her during her holiday. She laughed and said yes. She saw it. She immediately called me. She told me not to overthink it, not to worry. But then, two weeks after the holiday she didnt pull away. In fact, she became warmer. That was the turning point. The 5 weeks that followed: She asked her manager to move me to her project after I complained I didnt want to go on fieldwork. After that, we got assigned to the same project and we started getting close. Shed occasionally text me during the day things like: Dont forget to save your file This email is funny She called me to her desk to talk about random, non-work things her lipstick, jewelry, snacks, friends. Some of the things that happened: She touched my shoulder softly while declining a chair I offered She sprayed her perfume on me after others teased me about my scent She once drew a line on my palm and said, You have no luck She let me hold the umbrella for her during lunch when no one else was around She called me after work often for an hour, 23 times a week while driving home. It started as work venting, then shifted to personal stuff weight loss, family, guys who hit on her she told me she wasnt interested She showed me her health check-up results and said, My BMI is too low you need to bring me snacks Out of nowhere, she showed me her old photo and said, I was your age in this one I once grabbed her blazer by the waist, saying You dont look fat, this is very loose and she replied, I bought it oversized Id poke her back or shake her shoulder she always laughed, never pulled away She teased me about my plush keychain: Its dirty. Wash it. I teased her about her gray hair and touched her hair she laughed and asked, Did you find any? When others teased us as a couple, shed say things like I dont like kids or Hes too young, Once I asked her jokingly why people kept teasing us. She replied, Maybe because were both good-looking just kidding Then my girlfriend found out. She checked my call history and contacted my colleague twice, behind my back asking her to stop talking to me. My colleague told her: Dont worry, Im not going to date him. I dont like younger guys, Im already talking to someone. We just gossip about work. But neither of them told me any of this. And my colleague didnt stop. Even after the second warning, she still: Engaged with me like before Sent me memes on weekends one about falling asleep in the office This suits you lol Messaged me on Valentines Day during an office event giving out cupcakes. She said: Still online? Go get cupcake. I replied, Want to take a photo together? She said: Will we get two? She also: Once said while walking to lunch: Go up the stairs first, my skirt is short let others see it instead Called me on my day off, asking if I was tired I had just worked overnight Invited me to sit next to her at lunch, saying the sunlight was reflecting off the floor at my spot Teased me about weight: Ill lose weight, and youll be left fat alone Kept calling me after work as before Then came the emotional bomb. After my girlfriend contacted her a third time, my colleague snapped. At 2AM, she sent over 50 messages in a group chat with me and my girlfriend. She listed everything between us, framing it as meaningless: I told him to bring his umbrella because mine is too small. We just gossip about work and colleagues. I gave advice on his masters degree I never planned to go with him. You wont even let him have friends at work? From now on, go have lunch alone. Stop asking me Im really annoyed. Did you talk to other girls but tell her it was me? It felt like she was trying to erase every emotionally charged moment by listing them all at once. I was shocked. I left the group chat without replying. But the next day at work, she still joked with me. She said not to worry she wasnt mad at me, just annoyed with my girlfriend. Then she disappeared. She was assigned to the field for 8 weeks. No contact. No messages. Nothing. I reached out once during that time: Come back and help me too much work. She replied within 2 minutes: Same here. Come help me first. When she came back she reopened everything. Two days after returning, I ran into her in the elevator. She initiated the conversation: Her: You have to help me push the car. Yesterday I really struggled. Me: You help me youre bigger than me. Her: Im losing weight right now. Me: How much? Her: None. Me: You drink sweet stuff every day how will you lose weight? Her: Yeah, and I snack late too. I walk to burn it, but it doesnt help. I felt like the old rhythm had returned. She later walked past my desk and looked at same plush keychain she use to tease me: Still dirty. Why dont you wash it? When my friend said, You look like you just woke up, she jumped in: Hes not even awake yet. For about two weeks, it was like before. Playful teasing. Warm tone. But still no outside contact. Then it changed again. One day, I ran into her at a minimart. She seemed colder than usual. Her: You dont need to wait for me. Me: Im waiting for my food. Her: Its really crowded here. Her suddenly: Is your girlfriend still crazy? Me: No. Why? Did she contact you again? Her: No, but you should apologize to me in front of her. That day you left the group chat without saying anything. I dont know what you said behind my back. Can you do that? Then she walked away. I was shocked. The day before, she was still teasing me. So that night, I apologized. Im truly sorry for how I handled things. We got close fast, and I didnt really know how to manage my feelings. When you talked to me like normal, I thought we were okay I didnt realize how much it had affected you. I never meant to hide anything. I left the group chat because I was afraid Id make it worse. If a public apology still matters, Ill do it but I wanted to speak to you first, because I honestly dont even know if youd want to hear from me again. Her reply was brutal: I never liked you that way. I told you from the start I dont like kids. I dont care who youre dating what does that have to do with me? You have terrible manners. I just didnt say it outright. You were too close to me. Its disgusting. Manage your feelings? What the f are you saying? I called you to talk about work, and your girlfriend goes crazy at me. Say sorry to me in front of her in the group chat. I was shocked, I just said Im really sorry I never said that you like me Since then: Ive seen her at work for two days. She avoids eye contact. Doesnt speak. Cold. Distant. Nothing left. Did I completely misread everything? Were all her actions just friendliness and I imagined something deeper? Or was there ever something real before it all fell apart? TLDR: Accidentally exposed feelings to older colleague. She didnt pull away instead, we got emotionally close: teasing, touching, perfume, long calls, private jokes, even after my girlfriend warned her twice. After a 2AM outburst, she cut contact for 8 weeks but when she returned, she reopened everything. Teased me again, called back old jokes, acted like nothing happened. Then suddenly demanded a public apology in front of my girlfriend. I gave her a calm, honest apology. She lashed out and said I disgusted her. Now she avoids me completely. Were all her actions just friendliness and I imagined something deeper?",

    "text": "Hi, I 26F have been with my bf 27M for a year and a 1/2 now. We have moved in together and things are good. I will say he hasnt met any of my family outside of my mom once due to the fact that I dont have a close bond with them and we live states away. I havent been home to visit since weve been dating tbh since before we were dating. But I have met his family. I see them weekly and I feel we get along well. Now we have talked about marriage before dating as I am someone who likes to lay out things that are a deal breaker before getting too invested. In which we agreed on those things well and began officially dating. So we agreed that we both want marriage. He even told me to send him some rings I like. I had never looked at rings as I have only been in 1 relationship prior to this one and that relationship lasted a year and a half, and I broke up with him because I realized I didnt see myself marrying him due to a lot of incompatibility. Now my bf on the other hand before me was in an almost 5 year long relationship where he did propose to her, but she ended up cheating on him. Which ended their relationship. Ive always worried that his exs wrong doings which were traumatic for him, would possibly affect our relationship going that direction because he had such a bad experience. I ended up bringing this up to him and he reassured me that that was not the case and that marriage is in the cards for us. I started to feel like I was overthinking my future and getting engaged when I knew I wasnt ready for yet in our relationship and we had time and I should be enjoying where we were then. But around December of 2024 I started to feel the urge to talk to him again and touch base on our future, get a timeline, see where hes at. What kind of proposal I would prefer because I want something more private. What kind of wedding were looking at. Im not trying to rush him because weve only been together a year and a half but I think sometime between later this year when we had our two year mark and next year is when I would prefer him to pop the question and then I would like to be engaged For two or three years because I would like for us to wait til five years together to get married. This is just my first serious relationship where Ive moved in with someone and actually want marriage and is longer term and so Im just trying to figure out like how did you know you were ready because I dont know if its too soon for me to bring this up ?",

    "title": "My 3 year old was restrained in childcare for no reason",
    "text": "Location: Michigan Back story - our 3 year olds childcare/preschool teacher was diagnosed with Huntingtons this year. Long story short - our 3 year old With 0 behavioral needs and no safety risks was held down for no reason by a teacher the school knew had a medical diagnosis that impacted her cognitive ability. Around January, our 3 year old started not wanting to go on prek days when this teacher is the primary. She has been in childcare since 6 months and she is social butterfly loving life and all the people. So for her to show resistance was weird. But I kind of just thought, well, teacher is kind of different and has stuff going on and maybe shes just feeling that bit expressed concerns to the director who reported she and the staff are expressing similar concerns to the principal who is their supervisor. Feb into March she started full blow melting down on those days. Refusing to go, asking to skip. Dropping to floor and just struggling. Again, not her norm at all. I had been talking to director this whole time expressing my concerns and Im 100 positive they were being related to Principal because all of the childcare staff had the same concerns. Melting down turned into saying she was scared and teacher was hurting her. I run a large behavioral health agency so I know how to ask questions and I couldnt get her to a place where she would say HOW teacher hurt her just that she was afraid and she was. Im combination with that, I had other safety concerns and didnt feel that teacher would be able to help if someone was choking or a fire or anything. And my daughter started having bathroom accidents, I think just being so stressed. So I went to principal March/April and said we were pulling my daughter from prek and wanted her in childcare and teacher wasnt to be alone with her. Principal asked me to wait because they were changing teachers because of the concern. But they didnt So 2 weeks went by and I called the Lutheran school board myself. I wasnt leaving her or anyone else in an unsafe situation. That day the board decided to combine childcare with preschool so that teacher wasnt alone but I just found out they never actually relayed that to the parents. So no one knew there were concerns or that they were no longer just prek classes. And how is this the final solution? I had been working on getting my daughter into new location when I received a call from the director that this teacher has restrained my daughter by wrapping her arms around and holding her so tightly she couldnt move - all because she said she didnt want to clean up. Another teacher had to intervene. I reported to everyone licensing and child abuse line. Our daughter had a forensic interview and spoke well they said, and the case has been passed to the prosecutor to see what happens. The teacher resigned after being put on administrative leave saying she doesnt know what she did to our daughter My question is - what can I do from my end to push that this doesnt happen again? They could have termed her or relocated her but chose to keep her despite concerns about the teachers safety. What push can I legally give?",

    "text": "Location: maryland My ex, the father of our kid, took me to family court in 2023. I signed out of pressure and verbal threats. My lawyer at the time urged me not to sign it and go to the judge, but I wanted to just get out of it. I signed a parenting agreement that is somewhat controlling. It needs tweaking. My ex then in 2025 pressed criminal charges to use as leverage my opinion. He agreed to a stet docket and I didnt have to plea anything provided I comply with the parenting agreement he is constantly verbally bullying me, no evidence and I allegedly sent excessive messages to him My lawyer advised to reopen the civil case now that the criminal one is through. My ex told me if I reopen the civil case in any way he will retract the stet docket and pursue criminal charges on me. He told me he would tell the judge he cannot work with me, aka, pursuing full custody of our kid which hes threatened for years. Can he even do this?! I thought we had rights to update the agreement as needed. I feel so blackmailed and set up, to be honest. I have a meeting with my lawyer this afternoon but hoping to get some insight here.",

    "text": "there is an introverted girl 20 in my class whom I wanted to become friends with. I tried to get along with her by talking to her a lot and helping her whenever I could. However, it was incredibly hard to connect with her because of her introverted natureespecially considering how she would sometimes speak very little, but then talk a lot when she felt like it. Over time, I started feeling like she didnt really care. For instance, she would sometimes change plans at the last minute when we had decided to hang out. I kept blaming it on her being an introvert. But I hit my last straw when I had to walk to the university, which is quite far. Usually, we go together, but my other friends were busy, so I asked her what time she was leaving so I could go with her. She told me a timebut then didnt show up at all. I waited 20 minutes, thinking she might have been delayed, but she never came. I ended up going alone, and when I arrived, I saw her at the university. Apparently, she had left early. She didnt even bother to apologize or explain herself. I was pretty heartbroken by this and really dont want to be her friend anymore. It seems like she doesnt value the time and effort I give her, so Ive decided to keep my distance. However, my class is very small and were almost always together, so its hard not to interact. She has already noticed that Im upset, asking why I look angry, and shes sensed that Im ignoring her. I still care about her, especially because she shared a lot about herself with me. She often looks lonely and stressed. Still, I dont want to get close to her again and end up hurt. That said, I would really appreciate other peoples perspectives on this. Why do you think she acts like this? Should I start talking to her again?",

My 21M male best friend let call him Andrew also knows this as he has known me since we were in elementary school. We established since a long time ago that we werent going to get romantically involved at all, since he had a crush on me when we were sophomores in high school. Well, time skip to last week. I turned 21, and he turned 21 a month ago our birthdays are quite close together, and we decided to buy some drinks and get wasted at my house. I have no clue what happened, cause I was wasted. The problem is that he was also wasted, and we slept together. Jump to the next morning, and we are together in bed, and I am still shocked. We agreed that we were both drunk and didnt know what we were doing, but since then things have been really awkward with him. And I told my girlfriend about it too, since we dont keep anything from each other. She told me it was a mistake, a drunk mistake. I agree with that, but its been really awkward with Andrew and I dont know what to do anymore. I dont wanna lose my friendship with him, cause were almost like siblings.",

I have an older brother who is also around 2 years older than me, obviously she liked him a bit so they started talking and what not, they grew a bit closer and he decided he wanted our parents to know and her parents which is obviously something me and her were kinda against at first because shes been my best friend and we didnt want them thinking anything weird of it. I cant lie when i say i think hes a controlling manipulative person when in relationships, i let that be known but it was all fine in the beginning, with his past girlfriends he wouldnt really like them trying to be my friend and stuff so before they even got together my mom let him know like weve been best friends and he knew weve been best friends so that was that until he started bringing me into there arguments, trying to blame me for some of their arguments. It just got worse till the fact he started blocking me off his her social medias, arguing with me calling me names, and accusing me and her of being SEXUAL. i brought this all to my mom and she tried having a deep talk with him but hell even argue and say slick stuff to my mom but eventually he agreed to keep me and hers friendship apart from their relationship. about a week passed and i went to his room to get my dog, he flat on ignored me through the door while i was saying his name and could hear him on the phone i went upstairs to tell my dad to get him and thats when he sent me a message saying see this is why niggs dont give you sht. i dont even know what that was supposed to mean because i wanted my dog but he said that and proceeded to block me off of my bsf account when it had nothing to do with her, so i ft her and she confronted him and he got mad that i even called her and a whole bunch of stuff like that. but some other messsages he sent me were things like kys and when i tried telling him to stop blocking me off her account he said honestly shut that shit up u can text her on imsg. he once argued with me for like 3 hours while me and her were upstairs waiting on him then he said it was my fault he didnt have time with her. Hes just a really big manipulator and gaslighter and i honestly think it irks him that i dont put up with it call him out. my bsf has tried ending things and he says no he wants to fix it but never tries..i just dont know what to do and need some advice.",

    "text": "Location: Edinburgh, Scotland. A few months ago I was meant to stay at a short term rental property, for various safety, health reasons I did not end up staying. Upon many conversations/complaints with the booking platform I recieved a goodwill gesture of less than a fifth of the price paid. I reported the property myself to the local council and the initial investigation shows the property is unlicensed. The property listing has also removed from the booking platform either by the host of the platform. As the booking platform facilited the illegal property are they liable to provide a refund or will I have to personally raise a small claims case against the property owner?",

    "text": "Location: Mississippi. So I 18f started working at this oil change shop back in June of 24 right after I graduated high school, I was 17 at the timethis is important for later and working my first full time big girl job. I honestly love it here and most of my coworkers but ever since we will call him Joe m26 joined the company three months after me Ive been miserable. He constantly made inappropriate comments about me and gestures while I was still underage and bullies me relentlessly. Ive reported him several times and nothing ever came of it except for me getting in trouble for how I reacted to it which I suppose I get to an extent because I was pretty rude to him a few times. However last week he grabbed my ass and swore it was an accident but looking at the video it really doesnt seem that way and the fact he sent it to several people on his Snapchat and they all messaged me the same thing I no longer believe hes being truthful. I ended up telling our big boss about everything and how nobody had done anything to get it to actually stop and he said he would speak to my general manager and Joe I hoped that would be the end of it but I received my schedule today and I was kicked from full time to part time without anyone telling me!!! and I genuinely feel like it was because I told the boss what was happening and they are punishing me for it the general manager and R are related and both in managerial roles Extra info- hes grabbed me while moaning several times, told me when I first got my tattoo that he wanted me to bend over backwards for him, and that hed stretch me out real good",

But the truth is, shes let herself go and I struggle with attraction. Being honest would break her heart. I dont think lying is doing anyone any good though. Shes put on a lot of weight, she also just doesnt put effort into her looks anymore. Sweats, messy hair, no make up etc. She struggled with depression and is on the other side of that. She really seems happy. But I fear Ive enabled complacency.. we will have a great day together and shell like ask to stop and buy a pie I know this isnt good for her health. Ive dropped those hints. But honestly, Id just like my wife to try for me again. I put effort into myself, not to pat myself on the back but in near the best shape of my life. I wear actual clothes. I shave my balls for her. And I get greated hairy legs under the same oversized tan sweats. How do I let her know shes off putting without breaking her heart?",

    "text": "Hello, I have a relationship which is lasting 3 years. Please do not judge the age gap, he is the most kind man Ive ever know. Our relationship is good, I feel so safe with him. He feels like home and I know I can always come to him when I am not feeling ok. I know he would be great partner and father. We live ith each other. The only sad thing is we will not be old together and one day he will not be as healthy and active as I am. I fell in love with another man 30M. I know him for about year and half and I knew when I saw him it would be a problem. I thought it will go away, but it didnt. He has the same feelings for me, very strong. It seems like we were made for each other, we are so similar. I feel amazing when I am with him. I trust him so much and I feel we could immediately live together as we know each other quite lot. It is like we could skip all the dating phase and be a long-term partners. The thing is I feel very guilty for leaving my loving partner, who I still love. We had a planned and payed vacation, I dont know what to do in this situation. It is very stressful, my tummy hurts every day and I cannot eat properly. I dont want to leave a person which I love eventhough I know I would be sorry for not trying this new relationship. I just do not know what to do. My partner is very understanding, kind and good person. I feel so bad for him, I feel like I am a traitor. And what about the vacation, lol. It feels like a decision between two good choices. TLDR: choosing between secure, kind relationship and maybe a new soulmate. How to decide what to do, what is the right way and what do I even want?",

    "text": "Heres the situation. I bought a car in February based on the assumption that my parents would allow me to live in their house for at least 2 more years. Things have changed for them and they now need to sell their house by September, so Im moving out. Long story short, they have 2 other properties and managing the third one where I currently live is not working for them. A dealership quoted me 32k if I give the car to them. They said i could probably get 35k if I privately sold, but if I wasnt interested in that hassle, theyd take it for 32k. Im not interested in that hassle. I owe 36k on the loan. I intend to make enough money over the summer to close the gap 4k and then sell the car to the dealership. There are two options. In each scenario, the loan is paid off by September 2025: 1. Sell the car immediately, zero risk of the car depreciating any further, no more insurance payments 205/mo. With the proceeds from the sale, I can use that to make car payments for the next few months, or I can just let it sit in a high interest savings account for a few months while I keep making payments. I would make about 200 in interest if I let it sit. 2. Keep the car for a few months. Maybe it will depreciate by 500, thats a conservative estimate. I keep making insurance payments of 205 805 between now and September. Which option is best? I think its the first option, but it sounds silly to have an open loan on something I dont own. What would you do?",

When COVID happened, handwashing habits and fear of germs got worse. Im a teacher as well and tend to have a high stress job and when my anxiety and stress gets worse, these tendencies get worse as well. My main concern is the bodily fluids from a dog. Dog not staying completely clean on their private areas after a pee/poop break. And my other concern is being paranoid that the dog may not be completely clean. I miss having a furry companion and miss my late dog a lot. Can this gradually be overcome if I get a pet?",

    "text": "So this is going to be made into a short summary because 13 years is a long time! And nobody has time for that! So our relationship started off great like most do, and then I kept feeling like he was talking to other girls so when it was 2012 I ended up pretending to be a girl to see if my feelings were true.. turns out they were. He flirting with this girl me and ended up arranging a meet up, for sexual favors. When he got there I called him to let him know that was me he was talking to this whole time and he flipped. Thats mistake one. Then I noticed him and his daughters mother getting closed again, I asked could he keep the talking to just about his daughter. But he couldnt do that. They ended up doing sexual things together when he dropped his daughter off. I brushed that off and forgave him. Pregnant with our first child Mistake two. He ended up getting on pills and got super addicted to them. He would almost fall asleep behind the wheel when our son was in the car with us. He would spend all his money on those pills even though we were hungry. He finally opened his eyes after a good 2 years and got cleaned. Mistake three. Then a couple more mistakes happened where he would flirt with girls online, and be overly invested in porn. We would break up with each other here and there and I ended up finding guys to flirt with online because I was doing the whole tit for tat thing since he wanted to do me the same way. Lets skip a few years. I ended up getting fed up over the whole relationship and told him Im just tired of being a wife were really not married but weve been together for a long time because Im just not happy anymore in this relationship. Too much trauma. So I ended up meeting someone, I honestly didnt even really care for them like I thought I should have so I ended up just leaving them alone but in this timeframe he was literally begging me back every single day. Showing up with roses at my busy job. Wrote me notes. And of course my heart gave in once again and I got back with him. Then I became pregnant with our 4th child, and everything was really going great I was like thats what we needed for me to physically clock out for him to realize .. but I noticed a girl on his Snapchat that he worked with that I heard him talk about daily but just never thought nothing of it because our relationship was going so smoothly that I trusted him. Turns out I shouldnt have trusted him because they were sending nudes and flirting and honestly I dont know what else. He never tells me the truth fully. So I got super depressed because I just let that slip right past me and trusted him once again and now we have a baby. Shes 5 months now And it DOESNT stop there he flirts with another girl online and wants nudes. And his porn addiction has gotten even worse. Its an every single night thing even if he gets laid by me. He has made me so insecure that I dont even like him watching porn. But I would rather him do that but it always goes further than just porn it goes to other people as well. But were broken up again, and he is trying to love bomb me again.. and I just dont understand why he cant just do right if he keeps trying to win me back time after time. Its time to completely move on from our 13 year relationship isnt it? also if you have left a really long relationship what advice could you give me to make it easier?",

    "text": "Me and my friend both 24F have been friends for about 6 years now. We have had alot of good times together but i started to realize she kept alot of things from me and had a short temper so it led to some conflicts the past two years. I got her a job working with me and she ended up befriending my hater at work and would say well he hasnt done anything to me off the bat I started feeling hurt....betrayed and jelous but I just held it in but made sure to let her know my dislike of it but im not going to tell her who she can and cant befriend. She then tried convincing me to let him join us for plans and I refused saying why would I hang out with someone who bullies me at work? And she said just be mean back and had the audacity to be upset when I kept refusing and they couldnt manipulate my decision. Well I also was lied to for a year and she ended up admitting to me she cheated on her fiance with a guy off discord. Planned a entire trip to hookup and got caught finally so she told me. Shes now with the new guy but now I believe shes emotionally cheating on him with our coworker. She moved away and I was very upset and cried telling her Im scared to lose touch with her because im usually the only one to put effort into making plans/talking. She said that wouldnt happen but I stopped messaging first and I havent heard from her in months. I no longer work there but my old coworker texted me telling me shes been secretly calling my work bully everyday on her way to work so her bf wont find out and keeps in touch with him regularly and now even moved back to our area and hasnt spoken a word to me about it. Im hurt....confused and angry. How can I just be forgotten so easily when I poured my heart out to her. Im tempted to send a anonymous insta message to her bf to get back at her but im not sure if its wrong or if I can do it anonymously without her figuring out its me. I know revenge isnt usually good but im so tempted to get back at her for hurting me.",

I found out today he had been drinking behind my back and cheating on me on those nights. But he was my world and when he cared he was the best person in the world. I know he cared for me deep down but alcohol ruined him and us. Help me",

I signed an ISA in 2020 income share agreement, according to which if I earned above a certain threshold the company would take a of my salary, otherwise my account would be deferred. They had 48 months to collect 24 payments, and I paid only 12 of those since after relocation my salary has consistently been below the threshold. The 48 months window closed in February this year and this company keeps harassing me to upload my paystubs. If I dont do so, they would consider me as earning above the threshold and they would start charging me. I reached out to customer support with no success. I have complained about them to several consumer associations, but what else could I do? I dont want to spend money on a cease and desist letter, just because of their incompetence. Location: this is an American company and I stipulated the contract in the US. After a year I relocated back to Europe where I come from.",

    "text": "Im from Serbia and Im just starting a YouTube channel. My favorite streamer is IShowSpeed, and I wanted to name my own channel IShowMario. Im not copying his content I will make my own original videos but I liked the IShow style and wanted to use that idea. I know IShowSpeed is a very popular name and possibly trademarked. Could I get into legal trouble in the future for using a name like IShowMario? Could YouTube take my channel down or could he or his team sue me? I just want to be safe from the start, and Id appreciate a clear legal answer. Thanks in advance! Location: Serbia",

    "title": "Should I pay my friend back for paying to euthanize my cat?",
    "text": "Hello, I have been mulling over this for about a year now and I dont know what the answer is. About a year and some change ago, my cat, and best friend, suddenly had to be euthanized. I had this cat for 15 years and she was my best friend. I loved her more than Ive ever loved another animal. I woke up in the middle of the night and she was paralyzed from the waist down. She was dragging her little back legs on the ground and I knew immediately that it was all over. She was not going to get better and it cant be fixed. It was sudden, unexpected, and completely random. I didnt do anything, it just was a freak malfunction in her body. Obviously, I hauled her into her cat carrier and drove her in a panic to the emergency pet ER. It was about midnight so none of my family was picking up but two close friends really swooped in to save the day. She had to be euthanized. The vet told me there was absolutely no chance of her living a normal life like this. My friends are the greatest blessings in my life. One of my close friends even drove 5 hours in the middle of the night to be with me the night my cat passed. But its my other friend I have a question about. While the vet was trying to work on things, I was sitting in the waiting room, bawling my eyes out and just repeatedly calling my mom over and over again thinking that maybe if I was annoying enough the buzzing would wake her up. It didnt. But while sitting there, in shock, upset, crying, I looked up to see my close friend since high school at the reception desk. And as I looked, she pulled out her credit card and payed for the entire euthanasia. It was a lot of money, about 900. She didnt ask me and has never mentioned it again. But I feel incredibly guilty. At the time I was nearly destitute and wouldnt have been able to pay anything. She really saved me. Should I pay her back? It was very kind of her and I cant express in words how thankful I am. But it has been eating at me every day since. I am finally in a place where I could pay her back, in full, and it wouldnt ruin my finances. Should I do it? Whats the right thing to do?",

    "text": "I m26 since graduating high school have lived with my grandpa in an apartment and have always paid my share, about 2 years ago he convinced me it would be a wonderful idea to buy a house together since we were both already paying for a place anyway. We looked all around my local area with no luck, he asked me where my comfort zone ended and I told him about a 45 minutes drive from our current place and he found it, exactly 45 minutes away. He was so excited about it and it fell within the parameters I gave so I felt I had to say yes. Fast forward to present day, I still work around the original area about a 50 min drive from my home and I attend night classes in this area two nights a week. My girlfriend of almost five years has an apartment in this area that she rents with her friend and I stay with her around 95 of the time, only going home about 1-2 weekends a month. I dont help with rent at the apartment but it is worth noting I do pay my girlfriend and ls phone bill and will occasionally buy groceries there. It is also worth noting that my girlfriends 2 younger siblings stay here as well both still in high school I could see myself getting my own place or getting one with my girlfriend not today but in the next couple years or so, but am now stuck with a 30 year mortgage and a quarter million dollar home loan in my name. lastly, my grandpa would not be able to pay for the house alone My questions are: 1. What ways ,if any, can I navigate this situation? I dont want to live with my grandpa though my 40s 2. Do you feel I should help pay rent at my girls place even though I am paying a mortgage? 3. If I were to get my own place in the future, would I be a bad guy to not want the siblings to move in? 4. What are your thoughts or concerns? Sorry if this is long, I truly appreciate anyone who reads all this or responds!",

    "text": "Hi, so I 30f broke up with my girlfriend about a month and a half ago and I am having a very hard time. For a little bit of context, we had known each other for almost two years and dated for about a year and a half. I was head over heels for this person and I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. We were living together, planning a future, spending holidays and special occasions with each others families, had pets, talking about getting married, etc. Turns out she was cheating on me with one person and still in love with another person her ex the entire time. Her ex even texted me asking me to tell my girlfriend to stop texting her about how much she loved her and how she was going to do something to herself if she didnt talk to her, but I didnt see that message until months later, after we broke up FB messenger put it in requests and I didnt see the notification. I didnt have a clue about what was happening because i trusted her completely. The whole situation caught me off guard and has thrown me into a deeper depression than i was already in. I ended things after months of trying to make it work after finding out about everything. My mental state was getting worse and i couldnt handle things not changing and being made to feel like I was in the wrong. I am just trying to move forward now, but Im struggling. I feel empty and exhausted. I dont find joy in the things that once brought me joy. Im trying so hard to remind myself that things will get easier with time but it doesnt feel like anything is changing. Does anyone have any tips to work towards healing? How did you get yourself out of the darkness after a breakup with someone who meant everything to you? I know people will say, just get over it or just move on, its not worth it. Im trying, but its so much easier said than done. Im good at giving advice but Im terrible at taking my own. Any advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized software development with vibe coding: code generated almost instantly from natural language descriptions. But, are we really headed toward the future we think? Spoiler: Programmers who master the fundamentals will be worth their weight in gold. Why? Because vibe coding can make small projects or quick prototypes easier, but when it comes to professional and scalable software, there are fundamental skills that will never go out of style: Critical Thinking and Architecture: Its not just about generating code quickly. Building robust systems requires designing efficient architectures, understanding complex requirements, and anticipating future problems. No AI can do that. Maintenance and Security: Auto-generated code can be a quick fix, but in the long run, the real challenge lies in maintaining, optimizing, and securing software. Developers who understand the fundamentals can spot vulnerabilities and enhance performance. Solving Complex Problems: When code fails or systems face bottlenecks, only those with solid knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and best practices can resolve the issues efficiently. Long-Term Professional Demand: The reality is that in a future dominated by automated tools, developers who only know how to use AI without understanding the why behind the code will lose relevance. Companies will value those who can lead technically, build from the ground up, and ensure quality. The conclusion is clear: Lets not let the vibe coding hype cloud our perspective. AI is a powerful tool, but it doesnt replace deep technical knowledge. Developers who understand the fundamentals will be essential to ensure software quality, security, and sustainability.

    "title": "My Brothers a Cult Leader",
    "text": "TW: talk of SA by a sibling talk of a cult Needing advice on how to talk about this with my26f almost 7 year old Autistic son. I am not even sure where to begin. I apologize if Im all over the place. There feels like a lot of ground to cover. My older brother29 reconnected with his biological father in his early twenties. His father had not been involved his entire childhood. In fact, he didnt pay child support, cut contact with my brother, and moved to another state to start a family with another woman. His father came back into the picture a few years ago. During that period, his father did his thing trying to manipulate my brother into thinking that my mother was behind his fathers absence. My brother said he knew it was a load of crap, but still continued to develop a relationship with his father. As their relationship progressed, my brothers relationship with my parents took a huge hit. My dad had raised my older brother since he was a toddler, my older brother even called my dad, dad. My dad has always been incredibly humble and never held this over my older brothers head. He truly loved being the dad my brother needed and spent my brothers entire childhood trying to have a good relationship with him. His bio father had told my brother that he was a born again Christian and was pastoring a church, which was absolutely insane to me because he said he had only recently become a Christian at that time. It turns out, my older brothers bio dad is leading a cult, with the members being a majority of his bio fathers family. He sucked my older brother into it. Now my older brother is leading it with him. They took money from their cult members, tried convincing my parents and I to donate money for the trip, and then traveled to Israel, got baptized there, and since coming home from that trip, my older brother now claims he sees angels and demons everywhere he goes. He claims he can heal people on the spot and has been trying to physically resemble Jesus. The Israel trip, and angels and demons thing started happening maybe two years ago. Since then, he ruined my sons 5th birthday party by wearing sunglasses inside in attempt to avoid eye contact with my family and friends and refusing to acknowledge anyone, then saying he saw demons flying all around my son during the party. He refuses to attend any family events or holidays because he says everyone in our family has demons in their homes and he physically cannot bear it. He violently shakes/trembles and says he gets physical pain from it. A year and a half ago, I had to call and tell him that he was not welcome to my husband26 and Is wedding. Prior to the wedding, I was in a pretty bad UTV accident that caused a TBI, impact seizure and spine injury. I was airlifted. My mom let my older brother know and over a week had passed before she was finally able to convinced him to reach out to me. When he finally did reach out, all he wanted was to see the photos that were taken at the scene of the accident. I got really upset because I knew he wanted to analyze these photos, so he could say he saw demons in the photos. Crazy, I know. But in this phone conversation, I explained to him that with how he was behaving, I would not tolerate it at my wedding and that he was not welcome, but I did tell him there was room for us to resolve this if he wanted to. He doubled down. He mocked my parents and I for preaching kindness, called us weak Christians with no discernment and told us we would never be on his level, then once again brought up the angels and demons, and how he can heal people by a touch the way Jesus did. I cried on the phone and told him that I was mourning the loss of our sibling relationship He replied, its not personal. I have battled internally for years about wanting a relationship with my older brother, but also wanting nothing to do with him. He had sexually abused me and some of my younger siblings for YEARS, until he turned 17, after my one sibling tried to tell my mom about it. Naturally he denied it and somehow convinced my mom that he didnt do it. I know its repulsive, but my siblings and I have struggled with it for a while. He refuses to acknowledge it. I spent my teenage years fighting for his time and validation, and when the sexual abuse stopped, I felt confused and wondered what I had done wrong. Very interesting, conflicting but not surprising thoughts from someone who was SAd throughout their most formative years. I think my desire for a relationship with him actually stems from having a great connection with his wife and two of their three children. My niece is a couple years older than my son, and we had lived together for a couple years after my niece was born. She was my precious baby niece and means the world to me. When my nephew came along, I felt overwhelmingly blessed again. I havent gotten to build a connection with their youngest daughter, as shes not even a year old yet and we havent been seeing each other. After we all moved separately into our own homes, my sister in law and I talked every single day for years and managed to get ourselves and the kids together multiple days, every single week. When my older brother took his Israel trip, my sister in law came to visit and cried how she was so depressed and that my older brothers bio father, bio fathers wife, and bio fathers extended family were being very accusatory and emotionally abusive toward her. They were starting to not allow her to visit her family and whenever she did visit her family, theyd accuse her of doing ungodly things and having a Jezebel spirit. I tried really hard to be encouraging and be there for her, but that was the last time I had gotten together with her. After my older brother returned from the Israel trip, he made my sister in law cut contact with my family and I, and we could barely get a text out of her. This force of no contact from my sister in law has gone on for at least a year now. Almost ten months ago, I gave birth to twins. My husband, eldest son and I spent the first six months of the twins lives, relocated in Philadelphia at the Childrens Hospital, as my boy twin needed several open heart surgeries after birth. During this time, my brother and sister in law did not reach out. There was no offer of prayer, no comfort or encouraging words from them, no checking in. Id send my sister in law photos of the babies and she would rarely respond. They didnt even want to meet the twins. We have been home for almost four months now and still have not heard from them. I called my brother two months ago to tell him to say it with his chest that his wife and children arent allowed to see any of us anymore. His response again was, Its nothing personal. Then he told me if we wanted to see him and the kids again, we would have to go to their church and promised that we would feel the presence of God there. I cried and told him that I will respect the distance that he wants and that him and my sister in law will not hear from me again. I also told him that it was all up to them to repair this relationship. I blocked all of them from being able to see my socials or contact me. There is so much more that happened throughout this entire thing that somehow feels a little insignificant compared to the rest of this, but in short- during all of this over the years, theyd pretend they were going to get together with us so that our kids can play together, and then theyd lie last minute as to why they couldnt come, or flat out stand us up. This devastated my son each time. They did HORRIBLE things to my parents, especially my dad- which feels not my business to fully put out there. My Nana passed away in November and my older brother snuck in to anoint my Nana with anointing oil and told my mom that he saved her from going to hell. Etc etc. all crazy, random stuff that genuinely feels like too much to cover. All of this being said, my son has been relentless for MONTHS, asking me to reach out and make plans for him to play with his cousins. One day recently, I tried gently explaining to him that his aunt and uncle were having a really tough time being kind to people, and that we needed some space from them. That wasnt enough for him, as he still keeps asking. today was somewhat my silent, internal breaking point. My son has been going on all day about me reaching out to my sister in law again. I panicked and told him I would text her. I did not, shes still blocked. But he asked me if she replied. I lied and told him she did and that she said no. I feel so guilty for lying to him like that, but he will not give it a rest. He now keeps asking me why his aunt said no. I have no idea how to handle this with my son. He has a social delay, so sometimes he has a difficult time understanding something that other children his age may be able to comprehend. Im trying to be gentle with him and I want to be honest, but it feels like this is too extreme for me to be fully honest with him about. I know hes longing to see his cousins, but there is truly nothing I can do. My son and I have been sending my nieces and nephew cards in the mail. I dont care if theyll ever see them or not. It just feels like I need to do something for those kids. Please help. How do I talk to my son about this appropriately? Side note. My younger siblings and I have been very open about the sexual abuse weve experienced as children at the hands of our older brother. My parents are aware, theyve been grieved by it and very apologetic. Ive been in therapy and a support group because of it for years. None of us have actually talked about it with our older brother directly though. We know that day will come, but the moment just hasnt happened yet. We are also struggling with how this will affect our sister in law once it comes out. At times I feel like his behavior is a direct result of the things he had done to all of us and that he is running from it. He may not be a sexual abuser right now, but my sister in law and their kids are definitely victims of the rest of his behavior. What my older brother has done these last few years has been significantly worse than what I can relay in this post. I genuinely do not know how to put the rest of it into words.",

    "text": "For context: My mom is gone at the moment. But its the last few weeks of school and I need good grades because Im entering highschool after the summer so I cant skip as much as I usually do. So I need my younger brother whos 7 to make some money too. I let him stay home from school to go to the neighbors to clean hes really good at cleaning cuz he does most of it at home. The neighbors arent home and its only their son whos like 16. The parents obviously wouldnt have let my brother work for them but their son had to take care of the house while theyre gone but hes lazy asf so I figured hed pay if someone did the chores for him and he agreed. So later my brother came home and everything seemed fine but then he told me he stole shit from them so we could sell it. Idek what he did with the stuff but somehow he broke most of it. Maybe he just broke it while cleaning and then decided to steal it or sum idk. Its ike a very fancy watch and some crystal thingy or something. He said he fell but I dunno if thats true. The son of the neighbors came over and told us he knew the stuff was missing and said hed tell his parents that we broke in and stole it so they wont find out he tried to buy his way out of his chores. Obviously my brother cant go to jail or sum ig I cant either cuz u dont go to jail under 14 where Im from but well have to pay for the things when they call the police and we definitely cant afford that and our mom will kill us. I know this is probably my fault but can I fix this somehow? Or like whats a really quick way to get a lot of money to replace the crap? Or maybe I could talk to the parents and try to tell them Ill pay them back someday as long as they dont call the police or my mom but that probably wouldnt work. And also how do I make up with my brother cuz hes really mad at me after I snapped kinda badly at him. I mean I thought about telling the guy Ill tell his parents hes gay if he tells on us Im pretty sure theyre homophobic and ik hes gay cuz we kinda hooked up once. But thats a prick move and it could also backfire if it doesnt stop him from telling on us and if I tell on him then his parents might just blame me instead of him. I dunno what to do but I definitely cant let my mom find out. But clearly she will if they call the police. And theyre really kinda stuck up so Im sure they will.",
