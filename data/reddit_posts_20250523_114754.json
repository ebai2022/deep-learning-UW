    "text": "I found out that my exs porn addiction escalated so much. He engaged into role-playing with so many men and women and he was messaging underaged girls. They were all fantasising about having sex with underage or SAing underaged. He also fantasised about having sex with trans. And he was very homophobic. When i read it, i was so horrified and i asked him whats happening. He blamed me for his addiction and why it got so bad. Apparently cause i always fought him. So confusing how my behaviour is related to this? And he also told me that those fantasy was just about porn, apparently he was just desensitised and it escalated. I demanded for him to seek help because of how disturbing and traumatising it was. He agreed but kept making excuses why he had to cancel therapy. I wanted him to seek help because this can escalate to much worse. But he instead completely removed me from literally everything. Like i didnt exist. I know this person for 6 years. He blamed me for his addiction, he blamed me that he got worse because of my attitude, he blamed me that his moral compass is so fucked up around me. I dont understand how and why is my attitude can turn him into that? I didnt turn my back because i wanted him to seek therapy. His family didnt take this issue seriously and basically told me, its all just porn stuff. Pls dont be so judgmental because this isnt easy to deal with. Im seeking clarity",

    "text": "My friends and I usually take turns buying beer when we hang out, were all 21 still in college/hometown guys. We each take turns so there isnt really a count on how much everyone is owed but one or two guys do not pitch in sometimes which is why I have started to ask for money from each guy to make it fair when I do have to buy, some have an issue with it and some dont - some also ask to be paid back when they purchase. I have one friend that is on the kind of rich side and usually doesnt ask for money even after buying a case. If he does ask for money, I always pay. Is it wrong for me to ask to be paid back if I only have 2 to 4 beers and then leave my rich friend with 24 beers left roughly, even though he doesnt ask to be paid back most of the time when he purchases? I dont want to come off as a cheapskate. Its just weird because theres no real way to track whos turn it is equally without having the obligation to pay back the person who purchased that night.",

In their chat that one thing was obvious my guys friends and the girls friends met before. As i understand they didnt meet many times maybe one or two. Girl responded for emojis- what is this? And my guy said-this is a sign language I thought we can talk with you girls just by sign languages and the girl said-we just doesnt talk on call. I am worrying lately because he slept with some girl about four months ago and i think he is kinda losing interest in me. He told me he didnt love me i asked that but i love him i think and wishing this relationship will last long enough and happy but i dont feeling well and now i want to know what he meant by that emojis .

    "title": "Is it wrong to accept this much money for dog sitting?",
    "text": "A couple days ago I was asked if I am able to dog sit someones dog for 8 hours until 1am today, and I was told I would be given 100 before I even brought money up. I of course said yes. The thing is, my parents acted shocked when I told them how much I was going to make and said it was way too much. It is above minimum wage but I thought who am I to say no to an offer like this? I would have done the job for way less, but if theyre willing to give that much I should accept it right? Anyway I am here now and the dog is very sweet and well behaving. No hassle at all. And the dog owner is this really nice woman who is on the older side and going to a birthday party. The reason she needed a dog sitter was because the dog recently injured its paw and she wanted someone to look over it for the evening. I am now feeling pretty guilty and feeling like Im somehow robbing this kind old woman by accepting this much money for what must be the easiest job ever. Im just sitting here on my laptop whilst this dog sits next to me. I dont even have to take it out or anything because it has a back garden to run in when it needs. Is it cruel to accept the 100? Should I ask for less?",
