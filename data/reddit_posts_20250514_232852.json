    "text": "Hello everyone, as the title says, I feel my partner is loosing interest and I dont know how to tell him how it has made me feel I, 23nb, have been with my partner, 25m, for almost four years. He has been progressively less affectionate the last few months, and I cant tell why, I know he has been stressed from ex-friends causing drama, and from working on finals, but it feels like more than that. Recently, Id say since about January, he seems to be doing fewer and fewer things /with/ me. He either does them himself, or if I ask if hed want to come/do it with me he is passively dismissive nah I dont need to or I already did Its anything from going grocery shopping, showering together, cuddling before bed, etc. We used to play video games together at night too but now it seems whenever Im turning on my console to play with him, hes switching to a different game not multiplayer because hes gamed out of the games I like even though he was playing it two minutes ago We used to have sx about twice a week. We have had sx once since the beginning of march, and it was a quickie right before an event we were going to. It was frustrating because I had/have tried to initiate many times in these months but he just seems uninterested either too involved with his games, makes an excuse he has school work or grading to do, says hes not in the mood, or even seems annoyed at me for being so close to him He has never been the type to greet me at the door when I get home from work, but now itll be two hours that Ive been home before he even gives me a hug or kiss rarely a decent one at that What hurts the most is he still pokes fun at me just as much as he always has, but now theres no affection to soothe the sting, its making feel like shutting down emotionally I feel like Im only getting half of a relationship. I love him so much, and he says he loves me, but at this point Im starting to feel more like best friends who live together than as partners and its breaking my heart. We have been together for over three years and I feel that Im losing him. What can I say to him that makes him understand Im hurt by his dismissiveness, that I want an ounce of affection, and most importantly that I dont want to hold any of this against him I truly dont mind not gaming every night, or not having sx all the time, but its the demotion to roommate status thats hurting me. I barely feel like we are in a Relationship and were just friends who fuck once a blue moon. TLDR: my partners affection towards me seems to have evaporated since the start of the year, we feel more like roommates than lovers, how can I have the conversation with him that I still love him, but need more of what we had before? Any advice appreciated, hes the love of my life but Im hurting and dont want to burden him or make him feel guilty about needing some space - I just feel completely neglected.",

    "title": "Tennant Early Lease Buy-Out Question Indiana",
    "text": "Location: Fort Wayne, Indiana My current rental lease does not have any mention of a process for early lease termination, buy-out terms, etc. There is a VAGUE comment stating 60 days notice is required, but not within any context of the above. I verbally spoke with the property manager and she stated per Indiana law, a buy-out option is not required and therefore, even if they allow this option, it does not need to be present in the lease. It appears Indiana is not very tenant-friendly, so Im not even going to question that part. I was sent the Lease Termination Agreement and in addition to paying rent during the 60 days period fairly standard, there is also an Early Termination Fee of 1.5x the monthly rent again, fairly standard. Ive rented from A LOT of apartments/rentals throughout my schooling and career so far and I absolutely understand that a buy-out fee in addition to rent is pretty standard. But here is what I am questioning: There is a clause in this agreement that states Resident agrees that this amount shall be due and payable, and will not be subject to repayment to Resident regardless of whether Landlord has secured a new resident for the Apartment. This got me spiraling down a rabbit hole, soooo of course, I consulted ChatGPT 100 reliable 100 of the time, just kidding. This was the response specific to Indiana: Even if the landlord re-rents the unit immediately, the buy-out fee is generally retained by the landlord, as it was agreed upon as the cost for the early termination option. However, if the lease does not specify a buy-out fee and the tenant vacates early, the landlord must mitigate damages by attempting to re-rent the unit, and the tenant would only be responsible for the rent during the vacancy period and any reasonable costs incurred. I am proposing a move-out date of 7/31/2025, so this will give them over 60 days to find a new tenant, and I would be SHOCKED if they dont find someone before I move out. My signed lease does not specify a buy-out fee and I have not yet signed the Lease Termination Agreement. So now, Im consulting Reddit also 100 reliable 100 of the time, hehe: Is the bolded sentence true? I assume once I sign this document with that clause present, there is no going back, but before I sign, do I have any reasonable argument to argue this clause, or should I just suck it up and let it go? I could also consult attorneys in my area, but 1. I hoped fingers crossed! Reddit would be faster and 2. If you all tell me I dont even have a chance, then I figured I dont need to waste an hour of an attorneys time and can leave that slot open for others who have bigger problems. Thank you thank you thank you!!!",

    "text": "Location: California. Long story short. We bought a house. The house has a beautiful backyard that we fell in love with. Its the reason we bought a home built in the 40s that has a lot of work needed, including possible asbestos remediation, at full market value. We were also in a hurry to buy as my partner was couch surfing having started a new job while I finished the remainder of my time at my old job. The yard is fully fenced in and has obviously been that way for a long time. I recently went to the city to apply for a permit to build a small carport, and when the permit officer brought up a map of the property it showed that a large portion of what we thought was our backyard, is not. If the fence that borders the road was on our actual property line we would lose about 40 of our yard and the fence would be right up against the house. I went back and reviewed the title documents we signed and found the plot map that shows the map we saw at the city was accurate. We would not have bought the house if we had known this was the case. We definitely would not have bought the house at the price we paid. We feel very mislead and very disheartened at this point. Weve talked about getting a lawyer, but also know that buyer beware is a thing. We didnt measure the property until we went to get the carport permit. We just assumed and were not told otherwise, that the fenced area was ours. We dont know at this point what we will do. Were just super bummed. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hey all, to make a long story short.. Ive chosen architecture which isnt great in career prospects to begin with, and given the upcoming recession Ill probably be entering the workforce when everywhere is cutting back... I do have a side gig though, i do professional free lance photography which landed me about 12k last semester, that with my older savings and investments i have about 25k total right now spread evenly across ETFs and a few higher risk ones like msft. hopefully my business grows and i can keep taking jobs, although thats unstable my investments are doing fine rn, ive earned about a 20 return last year but im scared ill lose steadily when the recession hits. so I plan to either withdraw everything and put them in a stable high interest savings account - or go nuclear and invest in nvidia or something, praying it pays off and i jumpstart my portfolio any input would be great, thanks a ton",

    "text": "My best friend has been acting kind of weird lately and honestly idk what to do. Calling her my bsf is a bit of a stretch but shes the only one I really hung out with this year, and I dont know how to feel abt her behavior lately. For example, shes a real stubborn person and thinks like If you wouldnt say/do something out loud than dont do it in the dark. Thats good and all, but she pushes her beliefs onto other people so much. A few weeks ago, I told her a really important secret that couldve gotten me in a lot of trouble but I trusted her to keep it was talking to an older guy... yeah. I thought she was going respect the fact I didnt want my buisness out there, but I find out that she told one of our mutual friends w/o telling meby the way, she CONFIRMED she wouldnt tell anyone???. I ask her abt it and she plays dumb. I drop it and a few weeks later, I tell her Im thinking abt breaking up w/ him because he was making rlly sexual advances torwards me n it creeped me out. Again, I tell her not to blab, but she basically goes uhh, of course Im gonna talk lol. I ask why on earth she would do that and she tries to justify by saying shes, concerned that Im being groomed so why would she stay silent and not tell our classmates? no mention of an actual authority figure that couldve helped me btw. We go back n forth and I eventually convince her to keep her mouth shut but Im seriously questioning my validity here. She also constantly says/treats me like im stupid even though my classes are WAY more advanced than hers just because Im not good at arguing. She gives me constant criticism towards my makeup and looksdont mean to sound vapid, but Im way better looking than she is and things I do and is honestly kind of racist towards me at times but I suck it upim Pakistani, shes white. She also talks bad abt EVERYONE n is honestly very negative and I think she likes making me feel bad but it could be just me. She criticizes me in a way that seems like shes giving me advice, which is really confusing. Im so confused on whether I did something wrong and shes right or Im just letting her walk all over me. She has a lot more social support than me and im honestly afraid to speak against her at times bc Im really sensitive and dont do well with getting my point acrossstuttering, things of the like. She could be in the right and Im just being self-centered, I honestly dk anymore.. btwdubs, I broke up w/ the guy , also so sorry if this sounds like dumb high school drama lmao from an outside pov, whos in the right and what should I do?",

    "title": "In need of legal advice for fraudulent charges through PayPal amounting to more than 12,000 USD",
    "text": "Hi everyone, This is my first time ever posting on Reddit but I really need some advice. Back in February, I noticed some fraudulent charges going through my PayPal. I dont check my PayPal often and upon calling their customer service to report the charges, found out they amounted to more than 800 USD. I raised a claim and PayPal decided in the merchants favor, arguing that the merchant was successfully able to prove that I received the good/service I paid for. However, they assured me that they had blocked this merchant and these charges would not continue. Fast forward to last week, I go to check my PayPal again, and all I see are hundreds more charges from the same merchant going through. I call their customer service again and the woman assures me that I will be refunded for all the charges if I am not mistaken, this means she created an express promise. Well today, I ask a PayPal customer service representative through their online chat feature how much the charges amounted to and he tells me 12,345.98 USD. He also tells me that PayPal must complete its investigation and cannot guarantee the outcome of the case again if I am not mistaken, even him or any employee saying they cant guarantee the outcome of the case will not erase the express promise of the first woman I spoke to over the phone when I was reporting the fraud. I canceled my cards with the bank and since it seems like my personal information was compromised too, I have started the process of getting a new drivers license and passport and had to change the password to my email. But what do I do now? I guess theres nothing I can do until their investigation concludes in 8 business days but what if they refuse to reimburse me? Do I have a case here, since I called them about this fraud at 800 in February and they said they would prevent it from happening again and it has now reached more than 12,000? Location: PayPal Canada - but charges were made in U.S. currency Thanks in advance for any advice!",

    "text": "Because we live in a world where therapy is more expensive than the average person can afford Im here to emotional worry about it to random strangers on the internet and I hope to find some clarity and outside view.. . Some facts are scued because I have in laws that like to scour the internet for my digital footprint. Im a 30 year old female married to a 41-year-old male and we have a 3 year old child. Let me start off by saying we have been married 7 years I love my husband very thick and thin truly. We found each other in very low points in our perspective lives but both wanted to do better , time passes on, personal growth marriage, house, baby Ya da da da . To the meat and bones. As most new families are aware there is an adjustment period after having a child. When dating, while pregnant , and any other time there has been a mutual understanding between the both of us that if and when we had a family our desire was for me to be a stay at her mother. And here we are years later and I still get to be at home with our sweet child. My husband works three jobs to make that a reality. When our child became old enough I picked up side jobs, that I could tote them along with me. I am not bragging , I am not complaining I am mearly stating , that I too also work. I am starting two small businesses, maintaining our home, our yard , our garden , animals, and most importantly teaching our child all the things. I have a full plate. My husband works very different jobs very long hours and he does his very best to provide.and he does AMAZING we have a home , food, love ,life family we have everything we need and can save and budget for most anything we want . Will we be going to the bahamamas anytime soon .. no .. but we can go out to eat a nice dinner. What Im getting at is Im happy, Im Greatful, Im filled with joy and purpose in this life. My husband is not, hes tired of working so hard to have nothing, he likes to look back at his past and get mad at all the mistakes and lost time,compare his life to others , That never helps anyone you cant change the past,only learn from it. He has told me he feels bad. Because he has no hobbies, no passion, and Im gutted . I always want to help anyway I can ,but I cant tell him what his hobbies are. I cant help him see he is not what he feels, he is so much more . I just want to shake him and say snap out of it . Look around you ! In a world on fire we have more than most why cant that be enough? So my question is how can I help my husband See the only one holding him back is him . how can I empathize with him ? What can do to support or uplift him ?",

    "text": "My wife is a teacher and the window for benefits is open in May to start for the next September-August window. We have the option between a PPO plan and a High Deductible plan. The school district covers 100 of the premium for the whole family, so there will be no monthly premium for us with either option. We are hoping to have a baby within the time frame of this choice if all things obviously work out. As of now it is just my wife and I and we havent had to use insurance much as of yet in our lives. FSA max is 3300. I am 27 and she is 25. PPO: Individual - 1900 deductible and 6500 out of pocket. Family - 3800 deductible and 13,000 out of pocket. Coinsurance is 20 us, 80 insurance once we hit deductible. 35 copay for primary visit, 55 copay for specialist, and 85 copay for ER. High Deductible: Individual - 3800 deductible and 5350 out of pocket. Family - 7600 deductible and 10,700 out of pocket. Coinsurance is 10 us, 90 insurance once we hit deductible. Then obviously HSA eligible.",

I just finished my first year of college at a STEM school, and its safe to say that it has left me completely defeated. I failed two classes, and am starting to fall behind on my majors track. I know its still too early to say that I have officially fallen behind, but my heart seems to hurt whenever I think about summer classes and the upcoming semester. I worked so hard last year, and it amounted to nothing. My heart is fully into school, but it seems that my mind freaks out anytime I have to get back into school mode. Is there anything I can do when it comes to these things? I cant seem to shake these feelings maybe its impostor syndrome, or maybe Im too far in my head about college in general. Thanks so much in advance.",

    "text": "Throwaway due to main having too many identifying details. Been with my current company almost 20 years and Im in a management roll. We had layoffs last year and now again a few weeks ago. My department hasnt been affected either time, but virtually all areas of the company have been. If trends continue my department will likely be faced with cuts early next year. I thought I might be impacted with the last round of layoffs and was applying to a few different jobs, one that pays 20k less than I make now which is about a 25 pay cut. At the time I thought any job was better than no job, I got offered that position yesterday. Its not a management roll so would essentially be a step back in my career and its a 45 minute commute one way. There are supposed to be no more layoffs for the rest of the year so I think Im safe for the time being, but nothing is for certain. Theres security in the new roll, but little to no PTO and the hours are opposite of my husband so we would never see each other except for the weekends and then the commute. They offered me the top of the advertised pay range. I have not gone back to counter offer for more PTO or a wage increase yet. Im late 40s so I have my age working against me as well and I dont have a four year degree. We have around 5 months in savings quite a bit more if we tighten our belts. My SO can pay for the bulk of our major bills on his wage alone. 340k between our two 401ks together so our financial position isnt awful if I were to lose my job, but I know the job market is tough out there and likely to get worse. I realize that Im grossly overqualified for this position which is likely contributing to them making the offer to me. If I were to get laid off next year Id look at going back to school, but in the meantime put as much money as possible in the bank, while continuing a job search thats more on par with my current wage and skill set. Am I an idiot for potentially turning down a job that seems to have security in it whereas my current one may not?",

    "text": "Recently I f20 noticed that my mom has been struggling lately I dont want to go to in detail with whats been going on medically, but Ive noticed that her sleep schedule is out of order and sleeps a lot, shes doesnt eat well, stopped calling her friends and family and doesnt help with household chores. I noticed this a month ago. I have 5 siblings who are much younger than me, so our house is pretty messy at times. Since I was 8 Ive been helping with chores, like getting their food ready or changing diapers so Im used to helping them, but lately I have been needing to take on more tasks because she doesnt do them such as cooking, mopping, sweeping, dishes, groceries, deep cleaning ect., which are things she used to do, and we would divide these equally. And just for clarification, Im not telling you guys that shes stopped doing chores and now I have to do it and Im pissed bc shes not doing her job- Im trying to give context to when I noticed when she started slipping. Shes also stopped talking to my dad and only argues with him. This isnt weird to me, they never talked in the first place, but recently everythings been turned into blaming him for something she didnt do, and theres just an overall shift in her behaviour and feelings. I think shes struggling with depression and grief. Problem is, I dont know if I should ask her if she is ok or suggest her to seek help I come from an ethnic, immigrant family and she doesnt believe in mental health stuff. She thinks its excuses white people make up to be lazy her words- not mine! and Im currently a psychology student hoping to be a therapist, and she tells me to not take my studies to heart and believe what their telling me, because people that struggle with mental health come from poor families and have a bad relationship with God, and need to find Jesus. I would have came to her so much earlier if i didnt need to worry about this, and Ive talked to her about how flawed her thinking is but she is too stubborn to listen to me, and always cuts me off when I try to talk to her about this stuff, even when its me trying to tell her about my mental illnesses. Please dont be mad at her, or use this as an excuse to bash her ethnicity and religion. Shes gone through so much, but Im so exhausted and I cant help but worry about her. Any ideas for what I should do? Ideally Id like her to go to therapy, but even anything I can do to help me and my family would be great.",

    "text": "So my 29F boyfriend 30M has a lot of emotions and most of the time theyre negative towards other people. Its very draining, so when he vents or wants advice most of the time I dont have anything to say because my outlook on life is just completely different than his. Today he was venting about my family. A little back story here, I introduced him to my family last year and some of my siblings didnt give him the welcome he was hoping for. We are a very tight knit family and my mom raised us to be very sheltered so the result of this is that we are socially awkward people. I told my boyfriend this and that itll take them some time to warm up to him. Instead of just waiting it out and giving it time, he decides that they just hate him so he began complaining to me about it often, to the point I had to tell him to stop talking about my siblings in such a bad way. Fast forward to now, they still dont get on that well me and him broke up a couple times because of bad arguments we had in the year of dating, but they are warming up to him in spite of these things, and one of my sisters has a new man shes been talking to. Im very excited for her because shes never dated anyone before and shes all nervous and stuff and asking me for advice and its cute to me. So Im all giddy and squealing when we talk and my boyfriend is in the back rolling his eyes and saying small things under his breath. I ask him whats wrong and he tells me its not fair that my sister is getting positive feedback about her situation when we didnt get those same type of reactions for us. Mind you, I wasnt involved in the reactions with me and him so of course it will be different when Im actually able to meet someone that is being brought into the family. I just find it very annoying and childish and I think his emotions are too much to handle sometimes. I dont know what to tell him, if there is anything you guys think I can say please help.",

    "text": "About me, 24 yo virgin huge trust issues because I got cheated on 2 times Ive recently met a girl about a month ago, it was all going well and we were on our 7th date. Ive told her that I like her and she always told me that she wanted to take things slowly. So Ive never pushed to have sex, even if I wanted to and let her do the first move. Today was our 8th date and I went to her appartement, we started kissing and she stopped after a couple of minutes to tell me somethings that deep inside I already knew. I am not the only person she is seeing, she told me that she cant choose at the moment because its too early and we dont know each other well enough. Also she is not in a position to have a long term relationship. I understand her position but at the same time I feel like the third wheel in case her other man doesnt fit. She told me that she cant find issues with me, but its not the same with the other dude. I have to add that I was not the first person she met. She finds stuff in him that are irritating and that she dislikes. My issue is that I dont know what to do with her because I started to have feelings. It also comes at the worst time in my life where I dont know where I am at and am really struggling to find reasons to wake up. Any advice would be appreciated. I wonder what I should tell her, if I should stop or if I should ask why she wants to take so much time with me and tell her that I feel like the third wheel Just for context on my experiences I had 1 women cheat on me after I told her, we were about to do it and she avoided after I said it, the next day she had sex with a tinder date it was my flatmate and I was in the room next to her After 2 years, started dating again, met a woman and after 3 dates things heated up and so I told her, complete 180 and she wasnt feeling it. The next day I received a text basically saying that a was close to a sex offender and that she felt like I forced her. After that I kind of didnt have feelings and left stopped after 1 or 2 dates This explains my trust issues and lack of self confidence a bit. So right now Im completely lost and dont know what to tell her",

    "text": "For context, my wife and I have worked together for 4 years in our own business, and before that, we were part of her family business. Weve always been close - traveling, building, and sharing life together. But things have shifted recently. After her mums unexpected passing in 2023, she seemed to power through, but over the past 4-5 months, Ive noticed a change. Shes pulled back. Conversations that used to be about our shared future have become more introspective I need to figure out what I want in life. Ive been too comfortable. I dont want to just drift into the next phase. I want to make a difference. To add some context, her father owns the family business, and it was always assumed wed both step up when the time came. But lately, that tone has shifted We need to be clear about whats on paper i.e. shes next in line when her dad is no longer around. Im doing my best to respect the space she says she needs, but its tough. I find myself closing off - it feels like the natural response when the person youve built a life with starts to question the very foundation of it. Shes going away for a two-week trip soon, hoping for clarity, but Im left with more questions than answers. To complicate things, we live in a house under her name inherited, which adds a layer of uncertainty to all of this. Its not that Ive done anything wrong - shes made that clear - but Im struggling with what this means for us and how to approach this new, unfamiliar dynamic. Basically, if she wakes up one day and says its over, I need to arrange my accommodation and career which raises a whole level of anxiety. Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it? Would appreciate any insights.",

    "text": "Using a throwaway account to hide this post. My husband 38M and I 35F have been together for 14 years. We own a home together and have 2 young children that we both adore. We are both university-educated professionals with good jobs which makes it humiliating to even ask this.... As if I should already know. My husband has always had a temper, but it feels like lately cover the last 4ish years its getting worse. Some examples of his behavior: he openly calls me degrading names including in front of the kids, he puts our kids in the middle of fights, he will purposely make a mess and wait for me to clean it up, says I dont do enough at home I am the breadwinner, work full time and still deal with most of the household chores, etc... He has never hit me. Last week, we had a small disagreement over laundry literally over bringing a basket of laundry down the stairs. It seemed minor, he walked away. I then hear him call down the hallway in front of our kids rooms - they were asleep hey fuck face. Did you do it? He then walked into the room I was in. I told him I wouldnt respond to that name. He then became very aggressive, raising his voice, throwing things my way. I backed away and told him I was scared and he needed to stop. He continued to yell, rip things apart and throw things at me. When I tried to leave the room, he blocked my exit. I continued to tell him I was scared. He then got distracted ripping something up and I bolted out of the room and into a locked room. He left me alone for the rest of the night. Luckily, our kids didnt wake up. This level of escalation does not happen often, but it has happened in the past. I have since said I want a divorce. We were speaking tonight about separation details and I told him that I feel like he is displaying abusive tendencies so I dont feel safe staying in this relationship anymore. He laughed and said specifically about the incident above that I am equally to blame for his anger. That he is not and has never been abusive to me in any way. He then flipped it and said I have been emotionally abusive to him for years so if I ever tell anyone hes abusive he will tell people the same about me. You dont know me, but I really dont feel like I am an abusive person. Is abuse too strong of a word for this behavior? Is it just me? I feel like a fool for asking, but I think Im too close to it to judge the situation properly.",

    "text": "Location: Missouri As the title states, my lawyer recently died do to medical issues, and Im currently scheduled to be sentenced in mid-July. My next court appearance will be my sentencing. I have multiple questions about what I need to do right now. 1 Do I need another lawyer to represent me? How would I go about doing that? The information I got from some Google searching tells me that the law firm should have reached out to me, but I found out about his death from a family friend, and he is a solo-practitioner, not part of a law firm. 2 is there anyway I could recoup some of the money I gave him for representation? He charged my 15,000, but I wasnt fully represented until the end of my trial. Again, hes not part of a law firm, just a solo practice. If it is possible to get any of that money back to use on another lawyer, how would I go about doing that? Sorry if this is a little all over the place, Im just at a loss and scared because I am facing a felony conviction, and this man was probably my best bet at a normal life. Id appreciate any amount of help anyone can offer me, sorry if this isnt the right sub for this",

    "text": "I 31F have been with my husband 34M for 8 years. Ive been the breadwinner in the relationship for most of the relationship, but both of us tend to work long hours. Husband has OCD. My current job is unfortunately an hour away from where we live, and husband hasnt wanted to move for the last 8 months because he is looking for a job and doesnt want to constrain the search. Now hes open to moving before he gets a job, but itll take time, and my hours are now really long 60 hour weeks. I come home from work these days and the house is a mess, the leftovers are eaten, and husband is in a rotten mood. Its been really rough. To be fair - Im not really doing much either Im exhausted, but I really want to hire help - order more takeout, hire cleaners, pay the slightly more expensive mechanic down the road instead of the one 30 min away. Husband always pushes back with some excuse about how he doesnt like how the cleaners clean, or takeout is unhealthy, claims he will do it himself the way he wants, drops the ball for 2-3 weeks, then finally caves and lets me hire help. Its a horrible cycle that neither of us feel good with: he feels guilty, I feel frustrated, and both of us are annoyed with each other. I suspect some of this may be his OCD. How can we find a way to work together to get chores done?",

    "title": "My27f friend30m of 11 years has been in love with me this whole time. Ive turned him down, what else can I do?",
    "text": "Hi everyone! Ive been talking to my friends about this but I would still like to hear some public opinion about my future decision of whether or not I should cut my friend off. My friend, Lets call him Andrew, and I have been friends for 11 years. Weve had our ups and downs but through the years weve managed to maintain a good friendship, or so I thought. Before I get into the bulk of my current situation, let me shed a bit more light on our past. Back in college when our friendship was still in its infancy, he confessed that he had feelings for me. I quickly shot that down and made it clear that it would never happen. Despite that he decided to kiss the top of my head and declare that he would wait for me. I was still young then so I didnt confront him for that, instead I ran away. A few days after that incident, I was not talking to him. It got to a point where he threw a tantrum and ran out of our PE class. Me and a friend of ours had to chase after him and ask him what his issue was. He proceeded to whine about how I was suddenly treating him differently. WELL NO DUH. I WONDER WHY. Still, I remained friends with him and life went on. This was a mere hiccup in our friendship to me, as I thought he had moved on. Boy I was sooo wrong. Flashforward to today, I am grappling with the fact that I might have to throw our whole friendship away. Recently Ive gotten out of a long term6 years relationship, things were messy but I am still on good terms with my ex. In fact, hes quite close with AndrewThey hang out every saturday and sunday. This is why I am so perplexed as to what has been happening. Andrew has been actively making moves on me. They started out subtle until it was painfully apparent what he was doing. With encouragement from my friends I decided to confront him one on one, asking him point blank why hes suddenly making moves on me. It comes out that hes in love with me and that his feelings never went away. He was able to hide his emotions before because I was in a relationship. What I didnt mention previously is that when he confessed in college, it was a similar situation: He confessed 2 weeks after I broke up with my abusive ex. I was clear again, telling him I would never have feelings for him, our personalities arent compatible in a romantic way and frankly hes too emotionally immature. I told him he needs to improve on himself because he is just repeating his mistakes from back in college. I felt deeply betrayed because he doesnt respect me single, only when Im in a relationship can he keep his feelings in check. With a heavy heart I told him I needed space from him, that he shouldnt contact me for a while. I put emphasis that I still want to be friends but space would be good for the both of us. Hes resulted to stalking me online. Hes monitoring when Im on my social medias. I dont post often, and I had to turn everything offline because his incessant need to keep tabs on me. He constantly acts like I broke up with him to our mutual friends. In fact he told one of them bitterly that he basically knows Ive been hanging out with them in my down time. I honestly dont know if this is worth salvaging. He clearly cant take my feelings into consideration when I have to constantly tip toe around his. I am honestly stuck, because I do value our friendship but at the same time Im so done with having to deal with his emotions. There is a lot more I left out, but I didnt want to make you guys read through more. TLDR: Long time friend cant take no for an answer told him off twice.",

    "title": "How do I navigate a healthy relationship with someone who doesnt really have any strong motivation?",
    "text": "So I 29F am in a relatively new relationship 6 months with Josh 32M. We see each other everyday, and I have come to realize that he doesnt really have any hard-set dreams or doesnt have any huge plans for his future. He is a great boyfriend, and I feel very loved and really comfortable with him. Recently, we have started the conversation about moving in together as well as marriage, but I noticed Ive been feeling hesitant about the latter due to his lack of motivation in life. I want to throw in a disclaimer that he is far from depressed. He lives a happy life with a supportive family and great friends, has hobbies, and is very satisfied with where he is at in his life. I am the opposite, however. While I am somewhat satisfied with my life, I want to advance in my career, and I am always striving to better myself in my skills and experiences. My ultimate goal is to achieve very strong financial success so that my future children can live comfortably and also so that I can help those in need, such as to homeless shelters, womens shelters, and animal shelters. To note, we both come from once poor to middle-to-upper middle class background, but I have stronger connections in my industry. I dont want any resentment to grow, since he really is a great guy, but I fear that could happen any time soon. He feels that my dreams are out of reality for him, but thats only the case if you view it that way. Even so, if I ask him to try to work more on himself, he will do so, but half-heartedly. I dont want to push him too hard, since he is happy, and I dont want to spin it as if he shouldnt be happy with where he is at because thats just manipulative. He is very supportive of my dreams and believes I can achieve what I want, but why does he not feel that way about himself? How do I get him to share my dreams? Or, should I wake up? Please refrain from giving me advice on breaking up because that is not an option I want to take. Thank you for your time in reading through all of this. Id appreciate any real advice or thoughts on this post.",

    "title": "My bf 31M and I 32F have been fighting because his mother has been disrespectful to me. I talked to my bf about it and he brushed it off saying it wasnt serious. After a month of continued disrespect I blew up and said terrible things about his mom. How do I make sure this doesnt happen again?",
    "text": "So basically my boyfriend bought a business in another state and we moved. I still work a full time job and have a lot of responsibilities within that role. Additionally I have another client on the side that I provide marketing services to. I told my boyfriend I would help him with his business so I have been helping with the marketing - I built the website from scratch, create paid ads, built new social profiles for him, create all branding graphics, manage his email campaigns and run the analytics for his marketing as well. It is a lot of work. I also help him with business strategy when I have time. - leading into which, I do not have any stake in this business. In addition to the business, i take care of the house and cook all three meals for us, take care of the dogs, etc. His mom knows all of this and she knows Im helping with the business and I feel like she has been extremely disrespectful. When I first finished the website she asked to see it. So I sent it to her letting her know it was a work in progress since I didnt have much time to put it together. Her reaction was that it was terrible and she sent me several paragraphs telling me how bad the website was. Her reaction made me feel unappreciated and offended?? Like Im not even getting paid or anything and helping her son and thats how shes reacting? I let my boyfriend know that I did not appreciate her reaction and that It was rude and disrespectful. Ever since then she has continued to text me advice and suggestions about the business. She sends me ridiculous texts about things like how I should drive around to different community centers and drop off brochures. Her other ideas included that I should connect with her friend but not to steal her ideas. Etc. every few days she texts me a list of suggestions on what I could do for the business. Ive mentioned to her that I have a lot on my plate right now especially that work has been picking up for me and that Im cooking all three meals, we just moved to a new state, etc. her response was not the least bit concerned about my wellbeing but it was mainly that she was happy I was doing so much for my boyfriend. I was offended that she did not once ask me how Im doing or if I was ok, etc. she did not once say that she appreciated what I was doing for my bf. And I think its disrespectful that she has the audacity to include me in parts of the business that need work and then leave me out of it when the business is successful. The latest thing has been , she has wanted to visit us but we dont have furniture for the guest rooms yet because we just moved and also have been so busy. She texted me suggestions to basically hurry up and get furniture and that maybe I can go around to furniture or thrift stores to buy furniture quickly. I took offense to that as well. Ive been telling my boyfriend that I havent felt comfortable about his mom and that her comments are rude and overstepping boundaries. She has also been checking the website that I built multiple times a day- I can tell because of the analytics on the website. And she literally checks the site multiple times a day. I saw My bf didnt listen and I blew up about it the other day. I said some terrible things about his mother - that she is a psycho bitch, selfish, Karen, that this is the reason why no one likes her and I understand now, etc- and we got into a very bad argument. He said his mom is just giving suggestions but I honestly am feeling like she is taking advantage of me and using me to help her son at the expense of my health and well being. He said thats not the case but I have several examples to prove it. I can honestly say that Im so disgusted by his mother right now. I said some terrible things about her and quite frankly I meant it. Even though I meant those things, I would prefer that I dont react this badly to a situation again. How can I prevent this from happening again?",

He kept threatening me and against my better nature I got in his face and held a knife to him telling him to never threaten me I struggle with a history of mental health and as I have never been violent in my past or have any charges I dont know how any of this is going to look for me I have my second court date soon and I am just looking for some type of clarity, I ideally want to avoid any jail time as I have personal stuff id rather get into that would not get into that would make jail extremely bad for me.",

    "text": "Hi, me and my now ex have welcomed a baby as of January 2025 and weve been rocky but mainly happy and with shared goals for what we want our future to look like. Hes my first bf and only sexual partner ever so my attachment is quite hardcore. I saw a complete future with him and only him. The relationship has been rocky due to me finding out that he was messaging other girls during the beginning of the relationship which was hard to understand and let go. I decided that I could live with it and have been since however Ive made it clear that the trust isnt 100 there for he but can be regained in time. Ive also asked him for complete transparency if anything else has happened. He always insisted no. Nothing physical ever. Only tonight I found out that he slept with someone else twice in one night slightly over a year ago. In a public toilet and changing room no less. I somewhat befriended the girl and hang out with them on many occasions and suspected nothing. Bother reason Im so upset as I feel so stupid. He is a compulsive liar clearly. I have a baby with him and correlation in his familys house so going no contact isnt really an option unless you guys really push for that? I just want advice as Im doing mental gymnastics here trying to figure out a way forward for myself and son in the immediate aftermath of finding out something else. Im so heartbroken like I dont even know what to say. Note: Im very emotional right now but I hope what I wrote makes sense. Thanks guys. Send help.",

    "text": "From what I can find, most American Ivies dropped their Latin requirements around the start of the 20th century. Oxford and Cambridge dropped them in the 1960s. In the decades prior to this, what would Latin education look like? At what age would they start, and what level of reading proficiency would students acquire by the time they entered college? Would they continue Latin classes through college? Would their other college coursework require Latin, or was it only an entry requirement? Ive heard the so-called Grammar Translation Method used to describe the method used. How does this differ from the methods used today to prepare students of history to read in Latin or in other languages? Broadly, Im curious how the experience of language learning differed when if? all students had a similar background in foreign languages, compared to anglophone institutions today which cannot assume a single shared foreign language.",

    "title": "Girlfriend 23F lacks motivation and work ethic. Am I 27M too hard on her?",
    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We met when I was an entering senior in college and her entering freshman. I love my girlfriend and think shes a wholesome, kindhearted, and caring person which balances my personality and keeps me grounded to things that actually matter in life. But within the last year I started becoming frustrated with her on her prospects in life. I can see her as my wife and eventually the mother of my children due to her strong motherly characterstics and her always supporting me and comforting me when it matters, but I fear that her lack of work ethic will put us in financial ruin, leaving me to do all the heavy lifting and not able to provide our children with a better life than I had. For context, she comes from a family of entrepreneurs whereas I come from a family of the company man. We both live separately with our respective immediate families. Were also semi-long distance as we live about 40 minutes apart. We get together about once per week due to distance and how much I work. She is passionate about photography and wants to do it full-time as she was encouraged by her family and their philosophy. I have no issue with that, but in my opinion she doesnt work hard enough to get consistent pay out of it. She is skilled, but she isnt timely or persistent enough.To me it comes off as delusional that shell be able to sustain this for our combined income. I have a pretty good paying corporate job salaried 9-5 in a field that excites me so I love what Im doing for the time being. Im also going for my graduates degree and will be done soon. Ive have many conversations with her before talking about our future and how to best prepare ourselves for our next steps. In those conversations, Ive mentioned that were not financially ready and Im worried that we would struggle if we were to get married and move in together at our current state. We both want to get married and have children, but I feel like shes holding us back from that. Ive suggested that she goes back to school to finish her AA and pivot to 4-year or get a job from it, and shell go for a while, but then she takes long breaks saying that shes never been good in school and doesnt find it interesting, and that she can spend that time as a photographer. I also suggested that maybe she just gets a part-time job to at least make consistent money, but same thing shell do it for a while, take long breaks, then make excuses that she doesnt like the people she works with or says I can make more with photography! Shell go back to photography, then again, inconsistent work. Im stressing out because I feel like Im treating her like a dad and have to constantly course-correct her. Shell make sure to go out with her younger siblings to concerts, amusement parks, etc while Im working over 12 hours a day at my job and in school. Her siblings seem equally directionless but act like theyre wealthy and can do whatever and whenever meanwhile no jobs or businesses or school. Her family also didnt push her or her siblings to go to school like my family did. In fact I dont think they pushed them to do anything at all! Ill give credit that her parents are very successful running their businesses, but it seems like theyre never guiding their own children and are gone all the time working. They also seem like keeping up with the joneses types. My girlfriend does not share this attitude, but joins her family nonetheless which makes me skeptical now of who she really is. Shes mentioned that she feels obligated to sometimes, or that she views it as an opportunity to spend time with her family, which I dont necessarily think is a bad thing. Shes even shared that she dislikes when her parents go overboard with parties or big trips or big purchases and that it feels show-offy. Things have gotten real bad lately, where I feel like Im mentioning this lack of work ethic every week. This weighs heavily on her too and now shes stressed, and expressed to me that she feels directionless and is trying her best, but she cant work as fast or efficiently as me. I told her that I dont need her to be me, but I just expect her to work harder and be consistent if she wants to get married and start a family because we need the resources! Shes also mentioned that she doesnt have it all figured out because shes younger, but mind you my younger sister is the same age as her and is doing great. Now she feels like shes in a pseudo breakup and honestly Im feeling it too. I feel envious that other couples my age are getting engaged and looking at homes, meanwhile my girlfriend cant decide what to do or cant work hard/quick enough. I want to start a family maybe by 30 but it looks bleak right now. She thinks we can just get engaged and kick off the next chapter and that everything will work itself out, but I cant accept that. Overall, I think she can work harder and now I feel like a broken record saying the same thing to her every few months that she needs to either finish school so she can get a good paying job or make her business official and work 1,000x harder. She feels like Im being unfair and unsupportive, and is now questioning if I truly love her for who she is. Im conflicted because I love everything about her besides how she works. Do I not love her then? I feel like Im giving her so many chances to fix herself and choose something to do, and will often give her advice or actionable things to do or research, but its hit or miss if shell actually do it. She thinks that something that could help fix is getting engaged and living together she feels that by being in close proximity that shell feel more motivated and held more accountable. I just want her to feel good about herself, accomplish goals, and get progressively better. I also want to protect our future family and make our next steps as easy for us as possible. I dont feel like shes delivering and Im conflicted on whether I should stay and try to help more or just break it off. Again, finance and money aside, I enjoy being around my girlfriend and love her for slowing me down so I can smell the roses in life. But at what cost? The dilemma is choosing to be with someone for pure love and can show you how to appreciate the little things in life, or someone who is on top of life planning and understands urgency, is decisive, and works efficiently. Please give me guidance. Thanks..",

    "text": "I 26F and my husband 28M started off being best friends in high school. I was deeply in love with him, and he knew that. However, in high school, a close friend of mine who knew how deeply I loved him back then even started pursuing him behind my back since they were in the same class. He eventually started liking her back, choosing not to be with me because back then she was hotter than me he has never said this but his friends have let me know thats essentially why he went with her, through their own deduction. The reasoning for not starting something with me back then runs deeper. However, appearance was definitely still a factor back then, and thats fine...in theory. My logical brain understands because I really didnt become a better person glow up until university, so he didnt owe me shit, but I cant make my heart understand. It still hurts. Ill always feel like I was not the one who he picked first. His friends told me how much he liked her back then, and also heard my now husband casually bring up how her ass is so nice when we were teens to note: these talks about her or other girls only happened in highschool during general chatting. Him or his boys, once we grew older, never spoke of her like that, especially in front of me once we started seeing each other. They regret telling me those things back in highschool, however it hurts even more, knowing they likely told the truth back then and was honest because they didnt have to lie to me back then. I grew up being quite confident in myself. Even in high school, I didnt think I was ugly or anything and got attention as usual. But him liking her, a girl who is completely opposite of me, and getting to know his unfiltered thoughts of the type of girls he liked before we got together when we talked as friends basically resulted in incredible amount of insecurities since then from highschool because I felt like Im not his type. Since I dont have nice skin like she did, neither am I slim and tone, nor do I have a nicely shaped ass like her, even now that Im older. My husband tries his best to make me feel like Im his only girl. However, these past insecurities really really mess with me still. We could be on a nice walk and a girl who fit his old teen description of what his type was could be passing by, and I immediately fill with dread, insecure, and self-conscious. I notice this feeling at the gym, walks, anywhere. My heart just squeezes. I feel just bad. There is no other way to really describe this deep daunting feeling. I have no real reason to keep feeling this way, I had a glow up, not to beat my own drum or anything, but I can say I am considered above average by standards now, as well. I still dont have the body or ass I want, though. My skin isnt bright and is so dull but clear. But I still feel this way towards my husband and his past girls, and what he used to tell me about his type in women during times we were just friends. I feel like I can never be considered prettier than her. I wish I could stop having these bad thoughts, I want to feel confident again, even when Im with him. Any advice on how to deal with long-term deep insecurities such as this?",

But with me Im the complete opposite and Im normally sad all the time or stressed and I dont want to corrupt him with my emotions and although I have strict parents I still want a boyfriend because Ive never got to experiment and have fun with life due to my parents jumping down my throat the moment I do something wrong so Im not allowed to date or have a boyfriend at all. only dating when Im 25 to marry and I hate the limit because I will be a legal adult in 6 years and I feel like Ive wasted my time doing dumb things.. so my point is to decide if its smart to get with him for the remains 2 weeks left of school or to forget about it because after the 2 weeks its summer break and we arent going to the same high school but we really like each other. what to do?",

My son has started asking me where i have been when i get home a few minutes late. Not being mean or controlling at all, he just truly wants to know and thinks it is a cute game. And in reality, it is a cute little game. Problem is, it brings me back to the days of my controlling ex. My son was 2 when we split so I dont think he remembers anything from when we were together. And he was 10 when his dad passed. My son certainly has seen some things between his dad and dads girlfriends. And he knows we were not on good terms. But he does not know the extent of the abuse and I will never tell him. Here is my question. Do I ask him to stop for the sake of my own sanity? If so, what do I tell him is the reason? I dont want to talk bad about his dad unless absolutely necessary. Amd I know my son, he will hound me until I give him a reason. Or do I just stay as is and just deal with it in my own head?",

    "title": "Am I an introvert or an asshole?",
    "text": "This might come across as a vent, but I really do need advice on how to get out of this friendship that is draining me beyond belief, an I need help knowing if Im even in the right or wrong for feeling this way. Ive always labeled myself as an introvert. I hate being around people who arent close to me for long periods of time, and just crave going home and spending time alone with just myself, my speaker, and my sketchbook or a notebook to write in. I also have some degree of social anxiety which has been getting somewhat better, thankfully. Despite liking being alone, I, like all people, crave friendships and connection. Im fairly picky about who I let into my life, because Im worried about becoming someone I dont want to be, or being in relationships I want to get out of. Unfortunately, Im in that situation now. This person is intruding on my life and I cant kick her out. She has become someone who once was a fun person to talk to and listen to, to someone who ruins my mornings and interrupts my peace just by arriving. I am going to explain the things she does that bother me and try to organize it so its easy to understand in the best way I can. Overstays her welcome. She asks to come over to my house every single day, and when she does come over, she sits on her phone and scrolls through shadow the hedgehog thirst trap videos or brain rot I dont understand until I have to insist she leaves by making up an excuse or lie, and even then she fights me on leaving. I tell her an exact time she has to leave by because this that or the other thing, and she will beg to stay a half hour longer. The last time I let her come over she made me watch edits and brain rot for two entire hours. That is not an exaggeration, and I wish it was. She stays even until dinner time, and I live in an ingredients household, so Its rare I ever have snacks or anything. I know its rude to make food and not share with guests of course, so I never eat unless I have something to give her too. Its rare I have snacks in my house, but when I do, I try to make them last... but she eats most all of them now. I let her have the last snack, and she took two bites and left it on my desk to rot. Its been months since Ive had something quick and yummy to eat, and I let her have the last bit, which she wasted after begging me for. Repetitive. All she does is annoy me and give me migraines by repeating a tiktok audio she likes for the entire day. It changes daily, or maybe she sticks with the same sound for two days if she really likes it. I literally can not stand talking to her anymore. She doesnt even tell me anything, she just becomes a broken record and finds saying the sound out loud hilarious every time and expects me to laugh along with it. In the beginning, my habit of laughing at everything out of politeness and not wanting to embarrass people would kick in. Now, I just dont react. This does not stop her, she just keeps saying it. She can not seem to recognize personal space. During our lunch, she will be basically sitting on top of me. Im scooted to the very edge of my seat as far from her as possible until Im against the wall, and her leg will essentially be sitting on my chair and her knee trying to touch mine. It doesnt matter how obvious I make it that shes too close, as Ive come to learn. She just moves closer. This pisses me off a lot, because I hate people touching me when I dont want them to more than anything else. It makes me uncomfortable. Yes, Ive told her to stop. That doesnt mean she will. She does at first, but she gravitates closer. She has a terrible staring problem. Shes one of those people who thinks that widening your eyes as far as they can go and staring lasers through people until they notice is funny. Maybe this wouldnt be a problem, if only she actually stopped when I saw her making the face. Ironically, she always tells me how she has a paranoia of people staring at her, which has seemed to actually become a fear shes giving me now, too. I never really cared when people stared at me before, but ever since I met her and she started doing this stupid glaring thing, I freak out and I either react with anger or desperation to escape the situation / room. She just stares at me wide-eyed, and Ill look up, even throw in a laugh to say haha thats funny I get the joke, but she will just. keep. staring. I cant shake her. Ill even say whats up or something to try and get her to quit it, but she doesnt respond and just keeps going until I snap and say something that comes across as mean. I dont want to be mean... I dont want to sound angry at my friends. But its the only thing that works. All she does is yap about her stupid ex. Seriously. She only ever talks about him if shes not babbling some stupid ass tiktok sound. This might be a little minor but it drives me insane. Literally get over him dude. No self awareness. We were literally in a crowded hall and she was very loudly describing the size, girth, and color of what she thinks shadow the hedgehogs bit would be and people were giving us looks. Two people have started to avoid me because they associate me with her. She will say blatantly inappropriate and gross things in public as if nobody can hear her, and it has begun to damage my social life more than it was before. Always on her phone. I can not talk to her. I try to, and mid-story, shell slide her phone towards me to show me a tiktok video. Just thinking about it makes me angry. I can see she clearly isnt listening to me, and that she doesnt care to hear what I have to say because shes too absorbed in doomscrolling and trying to show me brain rot that isnt even funny. Genuinely, there is no humor to be found in it. Its like a png alien shitting rainbows or something. Hates how I do things without her. This does not mean I dont include her. When I try to tell her something silly me and another friend did who lives far away now, but we stay in touch through video games and discord, her reaction every single time is Without me?, and she tries to do puppy eyes. I hate it. Who do you think you are bro. My world does not revolve around you. Has left her friends for me. I never asked for this, or showed that I wanted her to only be around me. She randomly ditched all her current friends to sit with me and spend her mornings trying to find me to walk with me while on her phone. I wish she would reconnect with her old friends, so maybe she would like them more than me and just leave me alone. I feel like I sound justified in not wanting to be her friend... but I also fear I might be an asshole to her now. When she sits too close I say can you move over and she takes it as I dont like her being near me. When shes trying to interrupt my stories with TikTok videos Ive started to just tell her I dont care about this, its dumb and please just stop. I fear her only interests are things I dont know too much about, because I dont have tiktok and I dont doomscroll or find brainrot funny. I dont want to dismiss her when shes trying to share something that she likes with me, but I seriously can not handle it. When she repeats meme sounds nonstop I say I heard you the first time, you can stop now and she obviously just keeps doing it. When she stares at me, I dont even pretend its funny. I tell her to knock it off. I used to just ignore all these things, and now Ive started to speak up... but she really doesnt seem to know shes bothering me, which is why I think Im just blatantly being rude. She doesnt have my sense of humor, and shes very online while Im not. I cant connect with her, because we dont like the same things except for art. I dont know if what Im doing is working. I dont know how to shake this girl, because she clearly doesnt pick up when Im hating every minute of hanging out with her. I dont think I have it in me to outright tell her to leave me alone, because she doesnt understand what shes doing. All I want to do is be alone when Im with her, and she never cares. What can I do? How does this look from an outsiders perspective? Is this normal introvert behavior, or am I a dick who has to watch how she acts? Is this something I should really try to fix if theres this many problems?",

    "text": "I use to have this friend, Toby fake name and I took my anger out on him. We are both seventeen now. But we were 14/15 when this all happened. I would like to start off by giving a little background information. I am in NO WAY excusing my behaviour, just explaining why. My home life was very verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive to me. I slowly grew angry with everyone around me. I bottled all the abuse up and told no one. I want to repeat, this is no excuse for my behaviour. I am in control of my own behaviour. Now for the friend stuff. Like I said earlier, I was a very angry person. I would take things out on Toby. I did everything from play with his feelings to straight up lie to him. I did everything in my power to make him jealous and what not. I wanted to get a rise out of him. I treated him HORRIBLY. When I was fifteen, I saw how bad the friendship was and ended it. He basically blew up in my face and started cursing me out. I then got mad and started telling people about his mistakes in the friendship. Looking back on it, I see how much I hurt him. I dont know if apologising would give him any closure. I dont think theres anything I can do. I have been giving him space as I think of what to do.",

    "title": "Ex-girlfriend harassment",
    "text": "Location: Florida Ex girlfriend has been calling/emailing/DMing for months now, she kept demanding I pay back some money she had sent/spent during the relationship. I did begin to pay her back since at some point as she began calling 10 times a day typically after midnightin addition to messaging me through all possible means including making new accounts on social media and calling from other peoples numbers as well as contacting my friends and wife and so paying her some money actually seemed like a better alternative than having to deal with the constant stress of having her try to contact me either directly and at the rate indicated above or to those she knew I was friends with. The agreed upon payments stopped after I was late on a payment and she sent very insulting messages to both my wife and I. It is to the point where she has now sent a legal notice that she plans to sue me for the amount, Im wondering if Ill be held liable for that amount and if theres anything I can do to stop her from contacting me at such a frequent rate. Additional Points I did say I owed her money and that Id pay her back because I wanted to get her off my back. I understand this was dumb but she was attempting contact so frequently and so aggressively I gave into her demands. I can possibly recover messages where she stated I should just forget about paying her back, theres a possibility I told her something confirming Id pay her back past that though. Wondering if that invalidates her statement? I blocked her on the accounts and number I knew about and she made new accounts while also using her friends and families numbers to try to contact me. She has been actively stalking all my wifes and Is socials to the point that she sends aggressive messages whenever we update our profiles in any public way. Our socials are on private so she goes by number of post, profile pictures, bio changes, and changes in following/followers list. My main questions are: Since I admitted to the debt, Im assuming Im liable for that amount correct? What can I do in terms of her contacting not just me but those around me? My wife has been trying to help out with the situation but it mostly just seems to be escalating the situation further. I understand she obviously has personal feelings here but is it wise for her to get involved here? I do not wish for her to get dragged into this situation further especially if it brings consequences to her despite her doing nothing wrong.",

    "text": "Throw away account. Weve been together for a little over 1 year, but have known each other for over 4. We used to live in opposite sides of the country but she was from my home town and we started dating after I went back to living with my dad while deciding which college to attend. We started dating before I started college in a different state, but its only 3-4 hours away and we travel to see each other every week. The thing is: Im starting to feel like Im putting a little more work in the relationship. There are times in which its hard for her to come see me so instead of doing the every other week visit, I have to go twice in a roll. Doesnt seem like much, but its happening often and although I dont mind how tired it makes me, I just need to feel that shes as invested and dedicated as I am. Even so, when I get there, she doesnt seem present. She talks to me, jokes with me, listens to me, but I just miss a little more hugging and holding hands and being affectionate in general. I know that she loves me, she always gets me very cute and specific presents that show that she listens to me, she loves spending time with me, watching stuff together, hearing me talk and our sex life is great. I feel a little stupid even having these feelings because she is truly wonderful to me. But I cant help but feel hurt when she isnt able to hug me while watching something or just being affectionate in physical way outside of sex. Her mom is very hard to deal with and her life at home is generally very stressful and I know that plays a part in how she acts around me. When I tried to talk about these things she says she just cant do it and I want to respect her boundaries, but I dont know how to deal with my own feelings about this. I want to make us work, because I truly see a future we plan on moving in together after she finishes college 2 years from now, but Im scared my feelings might get stronger and Ill eventually ruin a great relationship. Any advice on how to navigate this situation? Ps.: you can tell me if Im being silly, just please dont be rude",

They then suffered two miscarriages, a stillbirth at 20 weeks, and now lost another baby at full term during delivery. feel awful for them. I cannot imagine the torture theyve gone through. I dont know why this keeps happening to them. We were all happy that their baby was doing so well and that everything was testing normal for this baby. My husband and I just had our first baby two months ago. We were excited to have babies close in age. I was also secretly scared that something would happen to this baby.. I feel a sense of guilt for having a healthy baby. I am grateful for my healthy pregnancy and baby. But I dont know how I can face them next time we see them. I dont know how to navigate this intense grief and how to be sensitive to their situation. I understand that my healthy baby doesnt equate to being insensitive to their loss. But I just cant shake it. I also dont know how much longer they can keep trying and keep themselves together.. like at what point do you stop..? Just looking for any advice or guidance. Anything for how to deal with this.",

So I believe my biggest financial mistake is my car. It was like 20,000 dollars at the time I bought it. Of course Im financing it. Before this car I had a little 10k car that was 189 a month. But someone rear ended me and totaled it. So when I went car shopping I had just got a new job making 20 an hour. Imagine at this time Im like oh ima make good money I can afford to DOUBLE my payment. then I got offered all these credit cards. For a little while, I was doing good managing payments. But I found out my career is not reliable whats so ever. I believe in the summer of 2022 I couldnt find consistent work. So I started relying on credit cards. And before I knew it Im maxed out, Im three months behind on bills. And then I had the nerve to have some type of mental health breakdown and began smoking weed heavily. I truly became purposely irresponsible not caring about the consequences. Until I realized that being an adult does not work like being a child. These decisions of not handling my finances/responsibilities does not just go away. Now that Im older, and I have a better sense of what I want to do. I would like to say Im a good 20k in debt, 10k left on the car. But Im so tired of the bad credit, the phone calls. And Im STILL in this unreliable field of sometimes you have work, sometimes you dont. My hours just picked back up again. So Im considering saving my checks this summer to buy a little cash car, and to save to file for bankruptcy and then run away to the military. I know 20k isnt a lot in debt but I just cant pay it. I desperately want a do-over. Has anyone had a similar experience? Any advice?",

The second leg was on Avianca, their partner airline, but also we made the reservation for both via Avianca. they were held at check-in for about 30 min while United called Avianca. something about their bags not being able to be checked thru due to a glitch. when the plane was already boarding they finally let them through. when they landed in LAX is when it got bad. at the arrival gate, they were informed that they needed to pay Avianca 230 for the already checked bags. the agent said she would not let them leave her gate until it was paid. she dismissed their wheelchair attendants and left them in a corridor for about 5 hours, returning every once in a while to ask for 230. the sister being ambulatory eventually decided to go complain to anyone else that would listen as they were missing their connecting flight. she and the agent were arguing at the gate for a long time before a good samaritan came up, saw what was happening, and paid the fee. allowing them to be placed on a new flight. on the flight itself, there were no complimentary refreshments. not even water. so my MIL asked to purchase anything they had as her sugar level was dropping. 5 hour layover after the delay, and 5 hour in air to home country. the flight attendants refused. they wouldnt even SELL her water. she is in her 80s. shes diabetic. she has BP problems. she could have died. what kind of lawyer can i call for representation? any organizations that can help? they are not US residents, so do ADA protections apply? what are their options for justice? to note: there were three other elderly passengers in the same corridor with the same issue. so it seems to be commonplace at least at LAX with this airline. please help.",

    "title": "Either my 45M husband is absurd or I 43M am a horrible human being",
    "text": "My husband wrote me a letter this evening that says Ive felt incredibly stressed out today from the way yoube been talking to me. I e tried to be patient and listen to you, and I understand you do have complaints, and some of them are fair. At the same time, the level of disgust and contempt Ive felt from you has obliterated my positive feelings for todayI feel you treated me like a piece of shit today, and Ive managed to cobble together enough internal feelings of self-worth through all my journaling and psychology books to say that I dont deserve that. There was another 3 paragraphs in there in which he expressed jealousy hes frustrated that I was kind and gentle disciplining my 12 year old about being on digital restriction and having to clean her room, which demonstrates that you are capable of restraint and composure when expressing something is wrong, you just wont do it for me. I deserve unfiltered anger becauseIm a piece of shit? Reading this I would think I had yelled and screamed at him, berated him, called him names even. What actually happened is I was making him lunch, he wanted to eat it on the patio but I noticed hed left a bunch of shipping boxes from my Mothers Day gift on the patio. It was REALLY messy, and only by sheer luck had the packaging not blown into our neighbors yard. While I was stewing on this a bit I noticed that the pile of wood he cleaned up for my birthday a few weeks ago had become a junk pile on the side of the shed. I made some snide comment about how it already looked terrible back there so I guess we could just shove aside the boxes/packaging to eat lunch? He was SUPER defensive about it being a part of his generous gift, so I focused on the wood pile and said honey, every year for over 15 years you find an excuse to create a junk pile in the side yard and every, SINGLE time I ask you not to because it makes me really uncomfortable when our house is surrounded by trash. He references this gift and how much time he put into it in the letter: I feel stupid doing that when you seem to hate me. Me not wanting trash all over my yard I hate my husband. Lunch was tense, and afterwards when he was asking me why I cited the general chaos in the house, including packaging still being everywhere 2 days later. Inside the house was more styrofoam and such, and just general mess because I did nothing on Mothers Day. He had Sunday, Monday and Tuesday off he only works 3 days a week so there was time to address this. He lamented that he ALSO feels so stressed by the chaos. I pointed out it was 70 him, and again he was getting touchy about his gift so I cited another source: he couldnt find some nuts to put on oatmeal in the morning, took everything out of the pantry and didnt put it back until lunch time. Also the packaging, which really did not need to be EVERYWHERE from the gift hes still assembling. Anyway that was it. The whole thing. I didnt yell, I was just kinda frustrated that the house is in a state and I WFH so I cant really clean on my breaks, I just have to kinda live with it and walk away and its not nice. He did, in fact, throw away most of the packaging and took care of the wood pile and boxes. I did all of the evening chores: cooking dinner, overseeing chores my child had to due as part of her restriction, swim lessons, Target order pickup, car wash, pharmacy pick up, and then I was greeted with this letter about how he feels I treated him like a piece of shit today. My husband has C-PTSD from childhood abuse that included everyone having to walk on eggshells when his dad was In a Mood or drinking. I do not drink, almost never yell I didnt today, and I am in fact very gentle-but-firm with my children. I still get frustrated, but it feels like there is no room for me to have a normal range of human emotions. When I point that out to my husband there is a lot of what-about-ism: what about HIS feelings that Im treating him with disgust and contempt? Its also possible hes not wrong. I want a divorce, BADLY, and due to my kids being young/some major life events Im looking at 2026 as the year I actually file. In the meantime I truly am trying my best to be civil and just get by. Do I seem like I am actually treating him poorly?",

    "text": "Hi everyoneIm a 23 M in a relationship with a 21 F partner who leans avoidant. We hit a rough patch over the last week and a half: she started pulling away, I got anxious, and it blew up into tension on both sides. Ill spare the blow-by-blow of our argument, but it all stemmed from her distancing and my fear of abandonment. we finally sat down for a two-hour talk. My goal was to: Stay calm and reassuring Let her know she could pause or leave anytime Validate her feelings without judging Offer space went for a walk when she got overwhelmed near the end, she started shaking and said she needed to leave. I walked her to her car making sure I didnt block her exit, asked if a hug would helpbut she wasnt ready for any physical closeness. She said our conversation felt stilted, and that she wasnt sure what she needed from me right now. Before she drove off, I asked if shed be open to a simple good morning or goodnight text so I didnt feel completely in the darkbut again, she wasnt sure. I told her Im committed to working through this and that Im doing my best to learn how to support her style of communicating, but Im also struggling with my own anxiety. What Im wrestling with: How to balance giving her space without feeling neglected How to reassure her without triggering her withdrawal How to manage my own abandonment anxiety while she sorts through her past trauma Questions for you avoidantsor anyone whos been here: What do you need from your partner when you feel overwhelmed in a conversation? How have you navigated stilted talks and rebuilt trust afterward? Whats a good way for an anxious partner to check in without smothering? Thanks in advance for your perspectiveany advice or personal experiences would really help. Me 23 M Her 21 F",

Ive been sleeping more, eating better drinking more water, and even just trying to have a positive attitude in general. Im just so over it. The expectations and pressure at my job are too high and I really need to find a way out. Ive been applying to jobs for about a month now but no interviews yet. I know i definitely want to give two weeks and leave on good terms but the lack of job prospects has been so discouraging. I just really need advice on how to get another job while still working 40 hours a week and still meeting expectations. Has anyone been through this? How do I job hunt without applying to absolutely anything out of desperation Im really struggling",

    "title": "I 21 NB discovered that my step dad early 50s believes in bonkers conspiracy theories.",
    "text": "This is a little disorganized and cluttered because I dont know the best way to bring all this up, and I have ADHD so Im gonna go on tangents whether I like it or not. My step dad is a weird guy. Hes Cuban and voted for Trump at least twice idk about the latest election. Ive overheard him listening to some ancient aliens podcasts or shows or whatever, but thought those were more like documentaries examining the beliefs of people who buy that crap. you know, the people who believe pyramids were made by aliens. Ive also overheard him watching some other stuff that sounded suspicious, but a lot of it went over my head, so I didnt give much credit to my suspicions that it might indicate something bizarrely shitty about him - aside from voting like an idiot ofc. Im nonbinary and closeted, so for obvious reasons I never really got close to him or discussed personal beliefs. I dont think Im in an unsafe environment, but thats in large part because I havent risked finding out. A lot of what I know about his beliefs comes from overhearing his conversations. Theres a few moments from the past year that I should probably also bring up first. My room is right next to a bathroom that connects to my 9 yr old brothers room who is my momearly 50s and stepdads bio son, and I often overhear my stepdad getting him ready for bed. I usually tune it out because theyre loud as hell and its annoying. One night I heard my little brother at the time 8 in the other room ask him if climate change is real, to which my stepdad replied well, we dont really know. Obviously I found that bizarre and alarming. I brought it up with my older brother 23 the next morning and he also responded with incredulity, but shrugged it off like Thats crazy. Anyway, And went on with his day. Im a non-confrontational person by nature probably to an unhealthy degree, so I let the issue drop. Another night, months later, I overhear my little brother asking what happens to our brains when we go to sleep. Stepdad gives some answer about souls I didnt really pay attention to, cause I was thinking about what I understand abt REM sleep and wondered about how thats studied. At the time I was like, okay, his answer was weird and not based in reality, but hey, people can believe whatever they want, theres nothing wrong with being spiritual I guess. But in hindsight I really should have remembered the climate change thing and connected the dots. I guess some part of me kind of did, but really didnt want it to be true. Side note: He does therapy Zoom calls either in his office or his bedroom, often with the door open? I thought thats supposed to be private... I would feel pretty upset if my therapist kept her bedroom door wide open for her family members to overhear me crying while theyre doing laundrylike I have with HIS patients. Thats so weird. Sorry for the tangent, I just feel like Im only now getting to air out what Ive been holding in about this guy. heres where things get bonkers. he was on a call a few weeks ago with someone, likely not a client or at least I HOPE not, while in the kitchen. Im making my breakfast as he starts getting louder more animated as he discusses stuff he finds interesting. I dont really try to listen, but you know, Im right there and hes almost yelling, Im gonna hear stuff lol. Then he starts saying something so genuinely wild that I start trying to write it down as fast as possible. I only started writing abt halfway through his rant, so I didnt get every detail, but I tried my best. its not that we came from apes. Its that apes are hybrids, who came from a long lost advanced civilization of humans -and so are pigs by the way, havent you noticed that their faces look kind of human?- that got so caught up insomething abt them having crazy armies or whatever that they had to get wiped out and humanity started all over I just. I dont know man. Where do you even get these ideas from? Did he believe this, or anything like this, when he and my mom were first dating? What else could he possibly believe? Does my mom know? If he kept those beliefs secret from her then why was he so unconcerned with me overhearing all that? Did he think I wasnt listening?? I was RIGHT there. How do I even bring this up with my mom? I dont want to raise concerns with him directly, because Im not close with him. But I fear whatever fallout may or may not happen if I do bring it up with my mom. Ive told my friend, who agrees that he sounds nuts, but no one else. What do I even do?",

During the initial divorce and custody agreement the judge said that dad has to pay me 200 in child support, even though neither of us wanted it. Judge said it was not for us but for the kid, so that was non-negotiable. 7 years later, dad and I dont have the best coparenting and dad has not paid child support in the past year. Normally I wouldnt make care, but my son 8 has been having behavioral issues at school which has had the school request counseling, kid has spoken to a school counselor on/off throughout his school years. Ive asked dad multiple times throughout the years to consent to letting me sign up kid for therapy. Because kid most definitely needs therapy. Dad refuses every single time. My question what are the chances of a judge agreed to pardon whatever dad owes in child support in exchange for letting me sign up kid for therapy. My insurance covers it 100, minus a 5 copay so dad wouldnt even have to worry about the cost of therapy.",

Its not like its annoying, or anything, but physically hurts my head like somethings being shoved in it. Small noises such as rustling, a faucet on, closing of drawers, an opening of a door, clicking of utensils, all really really hurts to hear. Ive been wearing my headphones blasting ambiance noise to drown it out but it does nothing. Worst of all, I live with very loud people, aka my parents. People who communicate by yelling across the house, who blast music and Tv shows as loud as possible, watch videos on their phone at full volume, speak loudly even beside you and get offended if I ask them to please be more quiet or please turn it down because its hurting me. The only time Im not in pain at home is when no one else is home or everyones asleep. What do I do to deal with this? I find it hard to be at my own house or be around my family because they are all incredibly loud people, and I am in pain all the time. Maybe I should invest in 24/7 earplugs",

    "text": "I 31F have been dating my boyfriend M31 for three months and we have been progressing rather quickly and dating very intentionally, often discussing what a future together would look like. His closest platonic friend is a 25 year old female from his grad school and he gets dinner with her weekly which often turns into hanging out after not at their places but say on a park bench near the restaurant for hours. He says they became friends about a year and a half ago after bonding over similar very traumatic past breakups and enjoy meeting up primarily to discuss dating and life. He says he really values the platonic friendship and wants to maintain it. For me, the frequency of it makes me a little uncomfortable. And the length of the hangouts. And how emotionally connected they are. I am never invited to these weekly hangouts and I know they talk about me and hes shown her my dating profile. I would feel a lot more comfortable if they hung out maybe once a month rather than weekly. I didnt say he needed to cut her off. Its just that he and I dont even go out to eat once a week so it just feels like a little too much for me. And of course shes younger and theyre emotionally connected and theres a hint of jealousy on my part. But after multiple attempts at expressing my discomfort in various ways, he has not been empathetic towards my feelings, he told me it was controlling and toxic of me and hes not interested in changing who hes friends with. Any thoughts here?",

It is driving me insane and the anxiety I feel is outlandishly intense. I have no appetite, i cant sleep, i cant focus, have very little drive, among other things. I felt fine with separation until they seemed to clearly seem regretful of wanting to separate and claimed to want time to rethink and address things. They were also a rather emotionally abusive partner , and I realize things theyre doing which are setting me off, and heightening my anxiety and stress. And yes its not smth I can control, I realize worrying about a bad partner/person isnt helpful regardless its just an intrinsic feeling that I feel and has been eating me alive. How can I help myself with this without contacting them? Contacting them would make things worse I feel and Id prefer to learn how to handle this alone. Anything helps, but if theres any tips to help quickly thats preferred because Im genuinely losing it lol. Thank you.",

    "text": "My gf was raised pretty sheltered, she didnt have friends all throughout her schooling middle school, HS, or even college and her parents didnt really teach her any life skills. Because of this, she is constantly asking questions or asking me to help on basic tasks because she cant figure it out herself and/or she doesnt take the couple minutes to critically think and problem solve. Now, im not expecting my gf to know everything, and I dont either. I have no problem showing her something new or helping every now and then, but it happens constantly and im starting to view her as incompetent. A couple examples, she came over my place and wanted to use my espresso maker and she couldnt find the portafilter thing that holds the grounded beans to put in the machine- it wasnt by the machine where it normally is, i asked her if she checked the sink as if its not by the machine it was probably used. It was in the sink and she didnt think to check there. She wanted to use my skincare, all my products are laid out in a table that visibly says what each product is and what it contains. She looked at 1 bottle, gave up and asked which one had the niacinamide ingrediant in it. I told her to just read the bottles as i didnt remember of the top of my head and she said its fine i just wont use it. I gave her a makeup wipe remover those little ones that hotels sometimes give u in ur room, that says makeup remover wipe in bold text. and i gave her a 2nd one, she didnt need the second one so i put it away, she then wanted the 2nd one so i let her know it was in my drawer. She dug around for a minute, pulled out a nose pore strip that was a different size, different wrapping and had the text nose pore strip and she didnt realize it until she opened it up. She didnt see that it was something completely different than what i gave her/what she used? She didnt take the 5 seconds to read the text to confirm it was what she needed? Heres the thing all these situations are so minor that individually they arent a problem, but they happen so often where instead she takes the 1 minute to think, she will just give up and ask for help. And its starting to build up and really annoy me. This makes me view her as incompetent because thats all i see, because what if im not there? Will she just never complete a task? Obviously not, i know shes figuring stuff out by herself, but why is it when shes with me, she just gives up and asks me for help? Why cant she just take the couple minutes and figure things out for herself like she would when shes by herself? This really bothers me when i ask her to do something for me so it takes the mental load off of me and i dont have to worry about it, but then shell come back asking a million questions which doesnt help me at all. I feel like shes using weaponized incompetence so she can avoid doing any thinking herself and I have to do it? Except its not intentional, so maybe shes just competent? I dont know what to do. I often find myself getting frustrated easily at her and starting to build resentment. I spoke to her about this before and she said she will work on it but i havent seen anything change.",

    "text": "Ive watched four loved ones die, and each time, I didnt cry or feel sad. Not once. Even now, I still dont. First was my grandpa. I was 8, staring at his open casket, and my first thought was, Eww, that doesnt even look like him. My dad yelled at me for saying it. Then my godfather dropped dead from a heart attack. At the funeral, I was so out of place that they forced me to play with the dogs in another roompeople kept yelling at me for not crying. Funny thing? I know I was his favorite, even over his biological kids. We had the same stupid sense of humor, the same way of thinking. After he died, his family accused me: You shouldve stopped him from hiking! You were the only one who knew how badly he wanted to finish that project. But even with their guilt-tripping, all I could think was: Dang. He died doing what he loved. What is the problem here? Later, my pet who lived 17 years died. I just hoped shed had a good life and laughed when my mom picked up her stiff body. My siblings acted like Id kicked a puppy. Two days ago, I am 23, my hamster died in my hands. I smiled watching her last breathnot because Im cruel, but because its wild how fast life just stops. And still, nothing. No sadness. I was just more fascinated. Heres the weird part: I can cry. Click the Adam Sandler movie destroys me every time. Ill bawl my eyes out over a fictional dad dying in the rain, but real death? Numb. My mom sees me and accepts me as me, but my sister screams that Im a psychopath. Whats weird is that she never lifted a finger to care for that hamster. I did. So why does she get to cry? Heres what I think: People dont cry for the deadthey cry for themselves. Theyre upset theyll never see or play with them again. But we know the life dies. Its nature. The memories dont vanish, so why force tears? Question: Am I missing something? Is grief just selfishness dressed up as love? Or do I feel things selectively?",

Saying hes going to lose everything. That this is the best choice for us because hes not ready for a baby. But not once has he asked what I need. Its all about him.

That he feels bad for putting me in this position. But at the same time, its clear hes focused on himself. Not me. Not the baby. Just saving his own peace and image. Lets also be real: hes a married man, a father of six, financially unstable, and emotionally unavailable. Hes already checked out. He told me flat out that if I keep it, Ill be on my ownbecause hes not jumping from one situation into another. So here I am. Pregnant. Confused. Emotional.

    "text": "So Im 14F and kind of joined a new friend group with this one girl, lets call her Yu, who seemed normal at first, if a little loud. She was pretty nice, smart and athletic and we seemed to be good friends. So a couple months into the friendship, they start talking about writing these stories about the people Yu likes romantically and it seemed funny at first and when I asked to see the stories, Yu was a little apprehensive but later on let me join the document. I started reading and there was funny parts but then I got to the backstories and things started looking extremely weird. She was writing these guys in our grade as sexual assaulters, necrophiles, and child predators/grooming victims and I was really shocked. Every else in the group seemed to not realize that this isnt normal and was actually really disturbing. I didnt know if it was normal since I was new to the group so I didnt bring it up. A couple weeks ago, I remembered this and decided to talk about it to some of my other close friends and they told me it was extremely disturbing and was not normal at all. Another friend in Yus friend group also dislikes Yu because a lot of other things she did. Me and the friend are planning to talk to Yu and tell her that its wrong to write these things. Also, she used chatgpt for parts of this which is also extremely unethical - it uses up massive amounts of energy and water. Yu also kind of has main character syndrome, she thinks of herself as a main character and everyone else is a side character to her. We dont know what to say to her, does anyone have any advice?",

    "text": "I have been dating my boyfriend for three years. We are going on a vacation this summer and recently discuss the price of it. My boyfriend makes75k a year, after taxes. I make about 34k a year after taxes. Huge difference. He wants to split the trip 40/60 I pay 40, he pays 60. But I dont think that is fair because he makes like 40k more than me. I feel like if anything it should be 30/70. He says that he has more expenses than me, but again I dont think that is true, he pays more in rent about double I pay but I have student loan bills that basically equal what he pays in rent. It is making me feel a little stressed because I am someone who wants to be with someone who is a provider, but I feel like a 40/60 split feels almost 50/50 which is not the type of relationship I want at all. I dont know what to do, just feel like everytime we talk about it he gets defensive, or makes it seem like I am the problem for bring it up. Is this an unfair split?",

    "text": "Hello, So I recently started esthetician school. There are only 6 girls in my class, so we all kind of talk to each other. Im in school 5 days a week, 40 hours a week. Initially, I was friends with two girls, but one of them is VERY sarcastic and kind of rude and kind of excludes me but it might be accidental. We were a trio friend group, but she is obsessed with the other girl now and they have become close. While Im still a part of it, I can tell she likes the other girl more and has become more snappy, sarcastic, and overall rude to me. I dont like her, but since were all kind of friends, I cant avoid her. I will say that I am not a sarcastic person and I take jokes to heart. So, she might just be joking around with me, but I have called her out a few times and now I feel like she dislikes me slightly. Shes very hateful, insecure, and immature, so I just dont like being her friend but I have to see her everyday all day and all of the other girls are friendly with her so I cant avoid her. How can I tolerate this for like 7 more months? I dont want to have any issues but I dont want to be super close so I can avoid her rude comments. Also any advice on how to not feel like Im being picked on? I seem to be the friend she goes to when the other girl is gone.",

    "text": "Location: RI Starting Monday morning and continuing as I write this, my neighbor has a company working on their leach field. The crew brought in excavators and dug up their front yard. However, my neighbor told the crew the wrong property boundary he knows where it is and the excavator absolutely destroyed a bunch of my land. He specifically told the machine operator to go dig out a large old tree stump near the edge of his yard, but fully on my property the machine operator told me he was instructed to dig it out. The destroyed area had naturally graded hillside and rock formations and small trees and stumps between my land and the neighbors. All ripped out and destroyed. They completely dug out the hill and removed the material or spread it into their yard. This also isnt the first time theyve pushed into my land. A few weeks ago they dug up a bunch of rocks on their side of the fence line and used them to build a stone wall that is now sticking over the edge of my property and is impeding the fence line. In other words, I would now have to make a dog leg in the fence if I wanted a continuous fence along the boundary, which is straight on the maps. I knew this was going to be an issue when I moved in two years ago. I wanted to get a fresh survey and updated markers and a full length fence when I moved in, but I just couldnt and still cant afford it. But now this mess is forcing my hand. Ill have to pay thousands to get a property survey to verify the encroachment, then Ill have to find legal representation that will be willing to work with me. Im unemployed and have no money to really do any of this. The only money I have coming in is a little bit of veterans disability. Ive been reaching out for quotes for surveys, but even if I find a way to pay for it, it will be weeks or months before they can get it done, at which point the damage is done. Im overwhelmed with emotions. I dont know even know how to begin to respond, so Ive just been blocking out the sounds while theyre working and recording video evidence of the damage after theyre done for the day or in the early morning hours.",

    "text": "I 25F was in a 2-year relationship with my ex 26M, who Id known since tuition days. His mom 50F always saw me as his best friend and we were really close she invited me over, packed me biryani, and even helped throw him a surprise birthday party. She felt like the dream MIL. Things changed when she suspected we were more than friends. She became overprotective, discouraged our calls/outings, and manipulated him into thinking our relationship wasnt right for his future. I realized I couldnt imagine a future with him without her constant interference. When I tried expressing that, I was branded the toxic gf. So, I left. Its been nearly 2 years. We havent spoken since the breakup, even though were in the same friend circle. But his mom? She still calls me once every couple of months we talk for hours, share life updates, and she even asked multiple times why he and I dont talk anymore. I dodged it until finally telling her theres nothing to say. She stopped asking. I dont hate her, but something felt off about her call today. Like why is she still holding on to this connection? She knows we dont talk. Does she just see me as a friend? Or is it guilt? Confusion? Control? What do you think?",

    "text": "For context : Im a high schooler In a program my school has for kids who are interested in the medical program that also lets you take college classes that will let me get 2 years worth of college credit when i graduate, along side a temporary medical license to work in radiology Now, ive never cared abt the radiology classes, its always been just a plan F when it comes to all the things i wanna do in life after school. Usually i would just force my way through but missing school due to medical and person reasons longest being around 3 weeks straight have made me fall quite behind on work in this class ,and the thing is , this class may not even matter. What happened was apparently, my school never got a supervisor which is a requirement to be teaching the course for the radiology pathway of the program, and they dont have any plans to get one soon, which is leading our teacher to believe the pathway as a whole wont exist next year , which means ill have to switch to another pathway next year.As of now she has stopped teaching us and giving us work as a whole because of that, and the class is basically just a free period now, usually i would try to get this work done, but im also backed up in more important core classes with final tests and projects,Is it worth it too fix this grade and try to get from a passing 68 to a 70 before the gradebook classes on friday with the risk i might fail classes that actually mean more?",

    "text": "Location: Kentucky. I was in a wreck last week, my gf was driving my car with me in the passenger side we had the green light and the other car ran their red light and hit us. We called the police who came and made a report, I have never been in an accident before but knew to get the other drivers info however because of the way the accident happened we were unable to safely get around the car to where the other driver was. When we asked about getting their info the officer told us it would all be on the report. I called my insurance that day and they told me to call when the report came back, which I did, then they told me because I have liability insurance I needed to contact the other drivers insurance and figure it out myself. After calling several different numbers for their insurance I find out the policy has been expired for a year and they have no current policy with that insurance. The officer who made the report is out until the 20th, the police say they cant do anything and that insurance needs to handle it, and my insurance says theres nothing they can do. Im just at a loss and unsure what to do, I tried reaching out to the driver today but havent received anything back yet. Any advice would be great, thanks.",

    "title": "Why wont my bf 31m reciprocate oral on me f24 but will with other women?",
    "text": "I24F started an open-arrangement with an older man 31M my now bf at the same time he was openly seeing another woman. He told me he wanted to marry her. He told me they had a promise to only perform oral sex on each other. He told me that he could not go down on me because he promised her, and told me he doesnt just go down on anyone because women are promiscuous and are likely to give him an std. As time went by, we began having unprotected sex and I told him I want to have an exclusive sexual arrangement if I were to continue having unprotected and risky sex, and he agreed to cut off all of his other arrangements. Three months later he asked me to be his girlfriend. He still had not reciprocated oral sex I had gone down on him enthusiastically and often to encourage him to do the same for me. From initiating a sexual relationship until now, we have been together for 8 months. He told me many excuses as to why he wouldnt for me: his ex cheated on him by receiving oral sex, his ex told him he was bad one time, he doesnt like it, he said I was pushing myself on him and he shouldnt be forced to perform sex on me. We have been together for over half a year and he still does not go down on me. His friends told me he makes jokes about women with long labia being gross. I know he was still talking to the other woman for two months after we went exclusive. He denies any infidelity while we were together. He refuses to tell me the relationship or timeline of the woman he was seeing simultaneously with me at the start of our relationship. I am depressed. I am tormented as to why he doesnt go down on me, but he had exclusive arrangement with her. Hes also bisexual, and I think it may be he doesnt like women. I think the possible reasons he doesnt go down on me but he had an exclusive arrangement with her is because: he doesnt have to put in effort because Im already committed to him, he doesnt like the way I look, he doesnt like the way I taste or smell, he thinks I have stds Im going to give him and her by proxy, he cheated on me with her and because its been an issue since the start of our relationship has guilt around going down on me. All I can think is that he prefers her over me, but settled for me and still doesnt like me. I have changed my appearance for him like getting body modification matching tattoos, piercingsI know I know, dying my hair, changing my personal style, etc. i think he values our relationship through social measures, like he enjoys that other men perceive me as attractive, or that being in a relationship gives others the impression that he is stable. I dont think he actually likes the way I look, bc he asks me to change for him. I dont know if its because he doesnt like my genitals or he doesnt like pussy in general. Whenever I confront him, he gives vague, generalized answers and closes down my questions. The argument is reoccurring and I have no resolution. I am at an all time low for my self esteem. How do I get him to communicate to me clearly? How do I get resolution?",

I havent seen him in about 2 months now. Ive had a hospital trip 2 times this pregnancy and he took me to one. My mom takes me to all the other appointments and everything. I had an appointment today and on the way home she started telling me how she wants to be in the room and doesnt think its fair that she doesnt get to be after doing all this for me. She believes that she is more deserving because he isnt around, hasnt bought much yet, and isnt coming to appointments. I talk to him every day on the phone to be clear so its not like he disappeared. But I tried to understand where she was coming from, but I also told her that he is the dad and its important for him to be there for his son. In turn this started an argument. She shames me since we arent married, and when Im happy she tells me I should be miserable and when Im miserable she tells me I should be happy. Its just confusion and arguments for no reason. She is always ragging on me saying how I ruined my life. Im happy and excited for my baby and I think really hope I will be a great mom. She says otherwise. This turned into a very heated argument because she kept pushing and pushing until I snapped and said I was tired of it. She then smacked me in the face 2 times and tried to grab my new phone that I bought recently and break it. I dont know why she tried that but okay. Anyway, she acts as if Im 16 years old.. Im 24. She says I cant even go visit my boyfriend and stay over there a couple of days otherwise she will kick me out. Before anyone says anything, I dont want to go live with him because I dont want to live with his grandma and brother as well. I thought staying where I was would be better for me to be comfortable while I heal and learn how to be a mom. I just dont know what to do. Im stressed constantly, scared its going to hurt the baby. Its like Im damned if I do damned if I dont. I dont have enough money to go out on my own yet, and I havent finished getting my masters degree. I guess I just have to hold out until I get it and find a good job? I just need some advice, what would you guys do in this situation?",

    "text": "The year before meeting my now partner I lost 45lbs, which is a lot for my 54 frame. I was able to do so by taking ozempic My partner is aware of this and has since asked me to stop taking it because he believes its bad for you not here to debate that, so I agreed. This request was in response to a Christmas incident where my dosage got messed up and I was violently ill for several days, ultimately ruining Christmas... Recently, while out with a mutual friend, ozempic came up and my partner said it was a deal breaker for him After the Christmas incident I did stop for a while. But, I felt myself slipping and started taking a maintenance dose every 2-3 weeks to maintain Ive been under a lot of stress between buying/remodeling a house, work, death of two dogs, and an unexpected pregnancy/miscarriage. Obviously when I became pregnant I immediately stopped along with all the other million things you shouldnt do, so do not come for me. But, it wasnt until the dealbreaker comment that I realized how serious he was about not wanting me on ozempic I have maintained the stance that I am off ozempic, obviously this is a lie. I have now been lying about this for almost five months There is an engagement coming this summer and I feel like I should either tell him the truth or just go off it completely so that its no longer a lie. I dont lie about anything else to him, I was/am just terrified of gaining back the weight. How would you all approach this conversation? He did say it was a dealbreaker but I feel like thats not a real stance and that he would just be a little mad. I would hate to be wrong though!",

I was very fortunate to find a credit union that is willing to lend me the money. Ive been doing some research but I thought I would ask ppl more knowledgeable about this than I am. They are giving me two options, I can take out a loan 300k at a fixed rate of 9.08 with an origination fee of 4.228 the apr will be 9.45 bc of the origination fee for every draw which will happen each year or I can chose a fixed 10.08 rate and not pay the origination fee every draw the apr will be 10.08 What do yall recommend?",

Its been at work for years, because of the amount of money it takes to renovate. Its always been their dream to open it. I left my job in my college town obviously, and now Im working under them. They pay me, but they havent actually paid me or my siblings also working for them because of how tight they are on money. Now theyre so tight on money they can barely afford dinner for next week. My dads business that he owns is so slow, and we sold our rental houses last year so theres only one small stream of income. The money I need isnt for me, I want to be able to give them some money, I know how much it would help them. But nowhere around me is hiring since Im working for them and they REALLY need our help I wont even have time to work another job. Theyre so insanely stressed all the time, the vibe at our house is depressing, and it just makes me feel awful. Ive been looking at jobs online but theyre all either scams or make like 25 cents an hour. Honestly, at this point Im willing to consider feet pics lmao. How can I make a couple hundred bucks? I dont have anything to sell, and theyre selling all the stuff they have to sell as well. Any suggestions help honestly. TLDR My parents are so tight on money unable to provide for our whole family right now, how can I make extra money to help them out?",

But over time, I completely ignored it and kept walking over it every time I entered and left the house, and Ive been doing this for weeks now. The dead rat has become completely flat and has basically become my doormat. I clean my shoes on it while stepping on it. My girlfriends also purposefully step on it. After so many weeks, Im thinking about getting rid of it, but Im not sure. What do you think, should I just leave it there to continue serving as my doormat?",

    "text": "This might not be the BEST place for this post but still posting as its an advice sub. So I 27F, just received a job offer in Boston they said theyd most probably be able to provide accommodation as well havent received the official offer letter yet. I currently live in Phoenix, so if I accept, Id be moving across the country on my own and I have no relatives/friends in Boston, no one. For context, the job seems quite appealing to me and Boston sounds somewhat exciting although Im having contradicting emotions too simply because, as happens to anyone, change feels scary. Another detail: my living circumstances here are great. I have roommates and we get along very well and we were already planning on signing our next years lease together if I were to find a job here. A good job opportunity hasnt come along yet, and the only job Ive been interviewing for currently isnt as great of a fit as the position in Boston, BUT I will be able to stay here and keep living with my amazing roommates. One downside is the role is outside my field, and Id need to teach myself a lot just to meet the job requirements so it looks like it will challenge and perhaps stress me a little bit at the very least. I am so torn between my options and although I know I must take other peoples advices with a grain of salt Id love some insights regarding this. PS.: Also, I will leave the country after a year of work due to personal circumstances, so either way its certain that this is not a long-term investment. Thank you in advance!",

    "text": "I want to start out by saying Im not blaming anyone for the consequences of my actions, I am not perfect and have made many mistakes in life. I just need help with what to do next. I lost everything when I ended up in the hospital after consuming a heroic dose of psilocybin mushrooms. I was roaming around the streets totally disconnected from what was going on around me. I did not nor was I looking to hurt anyone, I was just out of it and it took a lot of cops to restrain me and put me in the back of an ambulance. I woke up hyperventilating with my family on my bedside at the hospital . after I came down and went back home , my family has not been able to trust a single word that I say. Making matters worse , I broke down one day and told them that I have a lot of other problems in my life that are REAL and to a certain degree life threatening but nobody believes me anymore My family called the cops because I got emotional and they locked me up in an asylum for 8 days taking away a lot of my rights as an American in the process 5250 Californias involuntarily psych hold I try to give them the benefit of the doubt as to why the continue to make things worse for me but now my sisters have started to abuse me and nobody believes me . Unfortunately I have to stay at there house because I am recovering from medical issues that has even effected the way I walk. Someone I know laced my drinks with estrogen Took a while for me to find out what was wrong with me but it cause a severe case of Gyno. So severe that it lead to something called ATP Anterior pelvic tilt my posture is completely messed up and I walk with my ass sticking out I went to multiple doctors and I was on TRT for a good while Still have small amount of gyno but I was finally able to fix my posture and walk somewhat normal. Everyone even at work would make fun of the way I walked leading me to stay in my room for a while and not go out . My older sister took advantage of this and became a peeping tom . I caught her multiple times and she has seen me naked. I tried to tell my family but all they did was tell me that it was the drugs I took a long time ago and that I am imagining her at my windows . I have no problem leaving and starting over alone somewhere else but specifically my younger sister continues to threaten me with the police and now that I simply ask them to leave me alone and stay out of my life she tells me to my face that she will never leave me alone. that she will continue to help me for the rest of my life. The only reason Im here was to recover and finally walk normally again. I have no problem never talking to them again. I even thought about a restraining order but its literally everyone. My family told everyone I was crazy . I lost all my friends , Im about to lose my job and I have a dependent that I must take care of. Ive been drug and alcohol free for years now besides the TRT But nobody believes me Every time the cops run my ID it has me as paranoid schizophrenic all because of one phone call My 2A rights are non existent now and that closed the doors on many job opportunities that I had. I just need to pack my bags and get as far away from them as possible. Its just a very lonely feeling Thanks for listening",

    "text": "Yes I know this is never a good idea, but its also at a job I dont really have interest in staying at for a long time. I started there a few months ago and me and her would just exchange a few words here and there but started getting friendlier as time went on. Now whenever I come into work shell always say my name loud and in an excited way. I catch her looking at me multiple times a day when we work together and we will either mouth something to the other or just smile, shell touch or slap my arms if I make a joke or tease her a little, even my back or shoulders if shes gotta reach around me for something. Often looks at me for help with small tasks that she could do, sometimes she wont say anything and just look at me and Ill offer to help because I can tell thats what shes gonna ask. Weve never texted or hung out so I have no outside of work relationship with this person other than we follow each other on Instagram. A week or so ago one of my managers told me I heard you have an admirer here but didnt elaborate on it or bring it up again and shes one of the few people who are kinda buddies with that manager, but he also couldve been talking about a separate coworker that I was aware had a crush on me but she stopped working with us 2 weeks before he said that to me. Cut to last week she didnt have her car so I offered to drive her home since we were leaving at the same time, she said shes fine because her dad was already going to pick her up whatever. The next day she told me her dad asked her a question about me just like is that nickname she calls me? Because I guess she told him about me a while back when I interviewed for the place. Yesterday I did ask her what her plans after work were and she said going out with my dad why? To which I replied just wanted to see if you wanted to get dinner she replied along the lines of well Im already going out with my dad because its only Tuesdays and some other day I cant remember that I can and then gave me a smiley bye real name. So kinda hard to read the situation for me for context my dating life is completely nonexistent. I feel as though I shot my shot and its kinda in her court now if she has any interest of reciprocating. If anything, if it gets brought up I might just say well the offer is still there just to see. Any advice helps though thank you!",

    "title": "I lied to my boyfriend about my age.",
    "text": "About 5 months ago, early January I met a boy on a dating app, we hit it off immediately after we started talking, and in March we started dating. yesterday was our two month anniversary My profile on the dating app said that I was a year older than I actually am. For privacy reasons i will not be sharing me or my boyfriends age. He is two years older than me, but he believes I am only a year younger than him. Our relationship has gotten very serious, we talk everyday, and we are intimate quite often. The reason I lied to him is because most people immediately assume I am immature and refuse to get to know me once they know my age. I am much more mature and intelligent than most people my age, but most of the time people cant see past how old I am. We are a great team, we have strong communication and we really understand each other. Our relationship is very trustworthy and stable. I feel horrible about letting this go on for such a long time, but I couldnt bring myself to tell him because I didnt want it to be the end of us. This is the most serious relationship ive ever been in and I really feel like this could go somewhere. While our age gap is not illegal, he has said things to me before about how hes glad im only a year younger than him, and how he would be uncomfortable dating someone two years younger than him. Unfortunately I am two years younger than him. He brought up to me recently that he has lied about his age in the past and has been in long relationships with people who didnt know how old he actually was. I guess you could say im a bit lost. Obviously the right thing to do is apologize and be straight up with him about my age, hoping it doesnt ruin anything. I understand this is my fault and was not a great decision to be dishonest from the start. If anyone has ever made a similar mistake please share how you fixed it/what the outcome was. Advice on how to tell him and salvage this relationship is very much appreciated, thank you :",

Eventually, I caught feelings, and theyve been getting a lot stronger recently. But the problem is, I dont know if he swings that way, and I dont want to ruin our friendship by asking. He knows that I personally swing that way, and its never caused any problems before, and hes always been supportive. But, in the 7 years that Ive known him, hes never shown any interest in any sort of relationship with a male or female, so I genuinely have no clue if he even likes the idea of being in any sort of relationship. Hes always been pretty quiet, keeps his friend circle very small, just common shy person vibes overall. Were going to the same college, which starts in a few months, and we plan on sharing an apartment near the campus. I want to figure out a way to ask him, at least about his preferences, before we start college, but I have no clue how to start that conversation. I need advice, so here I am.",

I believe hes the love of my life, but lately its been challenging. a little bit of backstory his mom is a drug addict and his dad passed away when he was 9. Lately he has been very distant towards me, every time he tells me i hate my job, im miserable i ask well have you applied to other jobs his response. youre so fucking stupid, this is why i dont tell you shit his boss owns our house. if he quits the boss told him hell up our rent. I, am graduating nursing school this week. I have never paid rent, his promise to me was if i moved out of my parents house he would take care of me, fine. he pays the rent, i pay phone bill, groceries, monthly necessities, PGE, and his hair cuts, whatever he wants i buy. I even paid off all his credit card debt. We havent had sex in MONTHS, for the past 4-5 weeks hes been sleeping on the couch and ive been sleeping in our room. he always throws in my face well i pay rent so leave every time we argue he forces me to leave the house, and when i do i always come back. i feel so lost without him, but i dont know if he cares i leave, i have nobody i no longer have a relationship with my family and i have no friends at all, its just been him. im so madly in love with him and i dont know if he doesnt know how to communicate or he simply just doesnt love me. every time we fight he tells me i dont want to be with you i tell you to leave all the time but then 10 minutes later hes trying to make me laugh and get over the argument. I dont know what to do, i dont know if he loves me, or he even cares. Hes not cheating, he throws his phone at me every fight and tells me to look through it but then tells me i can find another bitch tonight, its not a big deal hes super childish. i dont know what to do",

Sarah and hope are sisters and hope is dating Mike. Mike is good at seige hes high em and I enjoy playing with them lately Ive only been playing with Sarah cause Ive been playing a lot of arcade to improve my aim. But Ive played with all of them for a while and Mike rage baits me and Sarah. More so to sarah cause hes known her longer but still sometimes to me. So cause I love to also poke fun at people in a playful way completely jokingly I started doing it back in VCs where you can tell i was joking and then he also posts on clips from ranked and such so I went and made rage bait comments saying Im better and stuff like that. Like obviously joking cause I am only okay at seige and he knows this. So in the gc were all in i send a video where its gold friend holding em from getting champ sent it to the gc cause it sometimes feels like that when we all play ranked together. Hope then responds to it with ? And I respond with its targeted at Mike as in Im holding him back from climbing the ranks. But then she responds with always is lol which like i dont think it always is but idk. Which then Mike comes in with a meme saying its weird which is take as them just calling me weird so banter right? So I send Sarahhh hes making fun of me : But then he sends a passage saying: Not making fun of you Im just saying you are honestly being weird and like honestly annoying idk if you playing or not but dude go comment rage bait on someone else dude it just bothers me man an i decided to say something and then another msg from him just fr its annoying.. And I totally understand that it might be annoying but I felt like I was obviously joking. But at the same time he did that in the group chat with me Sarah him and Hope and then it took what seemed like weeks of him building this resentment to snap at me like, I saw him as a brother that I could poke fun at like I do with my actual brothers. If he did it privately I wouldnt think i would be taking it this hard and I think i could properly think what to tell him but idk.

    "title": "How do I get back out there?",
    "text": "Basically : I recently left a 12 step program. I went to therapy and found I dont struggle with any form of addiction as I looked into substance abuse disorder. 12 steps doesnt teach the disorder, only their own shit basically. So from 21 til recently, they told me I was an addict and if I used my life would crumble or I could die. I didnt do therapy seriously during that time. I went once a month and usually left early and to please my psych to keep getting meds. But once I started therapy for real and began actually listening to my family and their speculation, I realized I wasted 6 years my entire time in a new state basically just telling myself I was this thing I wasnt, based on others opinions. I wasted time not being friends with non addicts because fear of relapsing like they told me. I removed people places things. I dealt with the HS bullshit and the mean girl things. I had people tear me down there in ways I cant word. I really wish I listened to myself and the rare moments of my family wondering, because its really stunted my growth. Anyway Flash forward- because of this, only know people from this program. And I dont want to really hangout with a majority of them. I moved here, went to one meeting, joined, and didnt really venture out except once. To which I dated a guy from the rooms. Thats a big chunk to things. I basically found through watching an actual addict use substances I was not that. Ugh. I feel Im all over the place. I definitely am. The ex is besides the point. Im getting to the meat of this I swear. After taking time to heal recently, I decided to get back out there. Ive deleted and remade tinder a lot since January, always just getting weirded out at times and not feeling able to move on yet blah blah blah. Anyway, I guess this flagged their system from what I read. I got banned. I never really replied all that much, when I did I kept it surface level tbh, I didnt even have cleavage in my photos, so I really think it was that. But I got perma banned. I have bumble, but its not really the same. And honestly from what i read, dating apps are the worst place right now to meet people. I didnt know that because I left them for so long and didnt really try to meet people on them. And honestly, I dont want to meet people from bumble or tinder if I still had it. The most thats gonna be is sleeping together maybe, and even if so, probably only once. So HERES THE MEAT: How do you go about meeting new people outside online group meetings like 12 steps? Is it weird to go to bars alone? Or are there other clubs out there? What spaces do you meet people at now a days lol? What do I DO?! Ive spent sooooo much time doing this fucking program. Its literally taken months to reprogram my brain for the toxic shit. I get angry because I feel it took so much of my youth, confidence, everything. I really wish I never did it. So how do you go about meeting new people? I feel so stunted because of everything where I just dont even know how to do it. Ever since leaving this shit, I just kinda sit at home or run errands and call my out of state friends. I have two friends I still regularly chat with from that program I love them, but I want to break from that community. Anyway, any advice appreciated.",

    "text": "i 20f go to my local elementary school sometimes after school hours obviously to swing on one of the swings to listen to music and daydream. i know its a weird activity i probably shouldnt do at my age but its been my main coping mechanism since i was around 13. i weigh around 140 pounds so i know it was kind of risky to be on the swing that often but it was a metal chain and ive read online that most park swings can handle up to 250 pounds. but today i was swinging and i abruptly fell because one of the chains came off. i practically ran away and now im just sitting in my car. i think the school is about to close but im not sure if ill get in any legal trouble or something. what should i do? thanks for reading.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now. Recently hes been undergoing a lot of stress due to unexpected expenses, looking for a new job, and general stress from his current job. Ive known that hes been stressed out, but he had never verbally expressed this until last night. We called to talk about how he had been distant recently, and this is when he started to open up about how the stress has been impacting him. He told me that he hadnt had time or energy for anything recently, including me --- which I get. I expressed to him that I understood where he was coming from and wanted to best support him in any way that I could. Hes always been upfront about how he doesnt like texting and that requires a lot of energy on his part. Because of this we dont text often, at most saying good morning and goodnight. And so I offered to free him from his duties for the rest of week implying that he didnt have to text me. I honestly thought I was offering a way to relieve his stress but this comment ended up escalating the argument, with him thinking I was saying this because I didnt want him to talk to me because I was mad over him being distant. It ended with him saying I stress him out in a very angry tone that hes never spoken to me in before, and that really hurt me to hear. Following this comment, I said I would text him later and hung up his friends were waiting on him so he didnt have much time left to talk anyway, and I wanted some time to calm down. I was honestly a bit confused by the comment because I feel I have become a pretty low maintenance girlfriend to adjust to his needs. We hardly text as mentioned before, and we dont call often either --- at most twice a month. We see each other once a week and do nothing together. And the more I thought about it, the more irritated I started to get. I have done a lot to support him and give him his space when he needs it, and still I am stressing him when I genuinely dont know what Ive done to cause that. I let him know I needed some space and havent spoken to him since last night, though he has since apologized. But I dont really know how to move forward with how Ive been overthinking his comment. Any advice as to how to get past this ? TLDR: My boyfriend has been stressed out recently and told me that he doesnt currently have the time or energy for me. I offered what I thought to be a solution that only ended up escalating the argument and he snapped and said I stress him out. His words really hurt me and I dont know how to move forward.",

    "text": "Hi guys, Im kind of hoping this gets answers quickly because I may just quit tonight unless Im required to stay. Location: Pennsylvania I currently work at Sally Beauty. We got a new manager who has been a terror since she has started. Mainly just encouraging gossip and drama, but then threatening us with write ups when it becomes about her. But I also suspected her of time fraud, as she would forget to clock out for her breaks despite announcing it, take longer than the 30 minute designated time, and then go back and edit her time card to be corrected. I had counted her spending longer than 30 minutes at least twice. So, because of her terror, I recently reached out to our district manager about her and informed her about her inappropriate behavior and time fraud worries. This manager insisted she would keep my name out of it. However they had a meeting today, and this district manager explicitly said my name and told MY manager about how I was the one who reported it. My manager now has written me up for being late. I had been late a few times but we had just talked about it yesterday and she said it was completely fine. Now that she knows I reported her, she has begun the process of writing me up for the tardiness. Is this retaliation? Im so sick of this all, and cant believe Im working in such a dramatic environment even if it IS Sally beauty and retail. If I cant do anything about it then Im sadly just going to have to resign effective immediately.",

Earlier this week I got into a crash in which I rear ended someone. They had no damage to the truck and trailer and I took all of the damage sadly. So let me explain, I go towards the roundabout, I look to see that the car in front of me moved so I turn my attention to the incoming cars coming from the left. I dont see any cars so proceed forwards and I hit him. He was completely stopped and trying to change lanes but I only realized after I hit him. We move over into a gas station to not cause any traffic and he told me that I didnt have to call the cops or insurance if I didnt want to and since I rear ended him, so I didnt. On his trailer was just a lone plank of wood that smashed directly into my headlight and it wasnt, to my memory, strapped down and sticking out further than the trailer. We had to end up reaching out to the insurance bc the repair wouldve been more than my car but still have to submit photos and let me know if Im able to get some sort of reimbursement from the crash. I never got his contact info or license plate so Im not sure how that would go. I also dont know if there were any cameras that you can see the crash in but i just want to make sure that this doesnt impact my insurance if its not fully my fault. This is my first crash that was my fault and Ive gone through these roundabouts so many times. Let me know, Thank you!:",

So when we we first started talking everything was great so far being LD dating we called more we video chatting we hung out for a few days but now hes not really doing that anymore.Ive been at home for a few months now due to surgery and dont have a social life kinda sucks being stuck in the house having nothing to do where I live or to keep me occupied , I pretty much rely on him for attention and wanting a relationship from him and her agree and as well knowledge I told him Im clingy and like attention and he said he doesnt mind and actually likes it but he doesnt even pay attention to me anymore and barley communicate or spend time with me to keep me as his. He goes to work every day and thats fine but what bothers me and Im noticing the problem is that he goes drinking at pubs and stuff with his friends plays games with them and hangs out with them all night and every time after work .At first I was jelly but had to calm myself down because you know he has a life to but he does it every day he tries to tell me that he would slow down and stop and put time for me and still hasnt its really getting on my nerves. I have muiltple times communicated with him about my feelings about wanting to talk and hang out more and fix this problem he doesnt see the problem with it but I do Im here waiting for him day and night even disrupting my sleep schedule to talk to him only to stay up or wait for nothing ,he said hell move stuff aside and spend more time with me and I try to stay up until 12am for him but he doesnt call hes not texting me at all til the next day he says the classic Im sorry .we even have each other locations hes at friends houses,bars,movies,games etc and Im basically getting tired of it . He barely talks to me its not even a dating thing anymore Im genuinely disconnected and discouraged to keep this up even though he says sorry should I stay or should I leave ?",

    "text": "Location: California, US Applied to an entry level job, junior developer at a mid sized company. Got a job offer, everything was chummy and then all of a sudden, I get a call saying that your background check triggered some criminal alerts, regarding some unresolved allegations. As a result, we are rescinding your offer. Some context behind this, DA charged me for theft a few years ago but hey, turns out it was all misunderstanding and he promptly dismissed the case. My attorneys worked to get those records sealed and since then, Ive never run into any issues like this during a background check they even ran searches in crim courts and it came up empty. When I pressed the employer further, they replied that we were able to match your SSN and DOB to that specific case, so we know it was you. I then asked where my pre-adverse FCRA notice was to which they reply yeah, we did not use a third party agency to get this info, only public info. Were exercising our at-will right and then after that started ghosting me. This wasnt some C-Suite level, government, or handling money case, I was a software developer for a private company lmao. But maybe Im overlooking something. Trying to understand what my blind spots are, and if them being able to conveniently match sealed records vs unique identifiers is even viable without the use of a 3rd party consumer agency.",

    "text": "My boyfriend really wanted to play video games with me. I told him I like Skyrim so he bought Oblivion for PS5 since we havent played that one. Anyway we made the character together actually I mostly did and named it and I was having a lot of fun playing. But recently he is very controlling telling me to do this and that in the game. Or he doesnt want me to play without him which you would think is cute but its actually because I feel he doesnt want me to mess it up. He wanted me not to spend all the money in the game when he was away and then asked me if I spent all of his money when its OUR money in the game. Also he doesnt act loving. I want it to be fun when we play but he gets super serious about it and has a serious face. I tried to kiss his cheek when he had the controller and he quickly said love you and seemed slightly annoyed. I dont usually ever try to do that. Then I confronted him and asked why he is that way and he says okay its fine if you do that but dont expect me to fully reciprocate. Then he says oh thats kinda rude.. Im thinking yeah no kidding. God forbid we have actual fun playing the game or every so often kiss or have fun or cute conversation. Especially considering we will play for hours at a time sometimes. Idk just isnt the experience I was hoping to have. Ive played games with exs before who werent this way when we played and could still be fun and loving etc I seriously dont understand. I did address all of this to him and he seemed to feel bad about it but it bothers me that this was how he was acting towards me. Dont get me wrong I really love the game but jeez. I tried to buy a buy bunch of watermelon to fill the house he bought out of spite of his attitude but unfortunately can only buy so many at a time lmao. Probably will just end up using them for something else. Anyone else ever deal with this? Makes the game not fun at all when he is like that.",

    "text": "Sooo I was friends with a guy for around a year and one night he picked me up to hangout. I was drunk already and I drank more at his place and so did he but he wasnt nearly as drunk as I was. Anyways, we both liked each other and we ended up having a one night stand I remember everything.. The conversation, what he said to me during.. I remember him putting me on top, i remember being extra loud idk why.. I was young, inexperienced and yeah and him telling me shhh bc his parents were sleeping in the house I remember him doing it from behind and it being kinda difficult and awkward since he was so much taller than me. He even texted me a day or two after flipping out asking me if I gave him something bc he got a bump then later told me he got checked and the dr said it was an ingrown hair. This was 7-8 years ago. Well recently I reconnected with him and he seems like a completely different person He used to be so kind, non judgmental and spiritual and now he seems like a judgmental dick to the point where I just cut off communication after a couple of days. Anyways, I brought up the one night stand saying it was the only time I ever did that and he acted like I was completely crazy for thinking that we had sex. He said I was so drunk that he only touched me a bit and nothing else happened at all.. Its not that big of a deal cus its years later and who really cares but idk.. I cant stop thinking about it. I know what I remember but then again am I crazy?? Do I think something happened that never actually happened? I just had to put this somewhere because I have nobody to talk too about it and I kinda feel ashamed that I was even in that situation to begin with I guess.",

    "title": "Nothing I 30M is ever enough for my wife 23F. Is this what marriage is?",
    "text": "Weve been together for 15 months. Got married 3 months ago. Ive recently found success with my own business. Enough that we both were able to quit our jobs and work on our business full time. Shes always struggled with her mental health. And it doesnt seem to be getting any better. I mention the business because she actually wanted to work on our business over being a nurse. When I met her she had a terrible job situation, would cry almost daily, come home miserable about the conditions of her job and the things she saw. Giving her her time back to be a SAHW didnt help. This business is the hardest thing Ive ever done, and its taking up a lot of my time and mental brain power. She says youre so distant, we never have sex anymore, I feel like its not the same anymore, but for me its just long days, and having to pickup her slack from not helping with chores. I work all day, trying to keep the lights on so we can continue working on our business, pay our employees, but she sees me working hard and being tired as a relationship problem. She has no bills, no responsibilities, no where to be, nothing to do. Exactly what she wanted by quitting her job. Calls me the perfect husband, says Im the most attractive person ever to her, and still its never enough. This week its the lack of sex, shes actually counting how many times I say I love you to her. And apparently thats not enough either. Ive been slacking going to the gym because the work days are so long, so I dont feel as comfortable in my skin, which leads to less than ideal sex I guess. In my defense, we have sex 2 times a week usually. Its when I want it, and thats about the frequency I want it. If we go one or two weeks without sex because were busy or something, or Im sick, or allergies are acting up, or Im tired, it becomes this huge thing that causes a big fight. She hates her body. I saw her in a skimpy top the other day and she looked good, and asked her to dress like that more often. Boy, was that a bad idea. Today she tried getting dressed in something sluttier to appease me her words, and when she asked for my opinion of the outfit, everything went out the window. She slammed the door, ripped of her clothes, jumped in bed, started crying. All I said was put on a push up bra, which apparently she was already wearing. She looked great the other day so Im just confused at what Im supposed to say. Nothing I ever say is enough. This started a huge argument about how she sees me as perfect, but she has to compete with better looking women on a daily basis just to keep me interested. Ive never said that or hinted at that even remotely. Its always something with her. Not loving her job, not wanting to be a nurse anymore, not getting enough sex, not getting enough I love yous, not having enough fulfillment, not having her own money I pay all the bills and buy her whatever she wants, not being attractive enough, not having big enough boobs or butt, having to compete with other women, not being liked by her family, how bad she sucks at everything, how dumb she is. Its exhausting, and I cant do it for the rest of my life. Shes in therapy, and came off her SSRIs and is against getting back on them because they make her numb and ruin her sex drive and emotions. Sometimes I wonder if this is just what marriage is. Having a wife who is constantly dissatisfied even when she has everything shes asked for or could want. I dont get it. We talked about divorce tonight, because I cant do this forever. I do everything I can to make her happy, buy her gifts, small gestures, tell her I love her, I appreciate her, cook for her, do the chores, pay the bills, work my ass off to keep the business running, tell her shes the most beautiful girl in the world, reassure her. Its just never enough. Is this what marriage is?",

His job sucks and I asked and asked and he always blamed his job. Fast forward to January. I found tinder. Confronted him. We worked through it. A week before my bday I found tinder again. Hes never cheated and his profile isnt even complete on there but like this IS an issue. Basically I said if I see it again Im done. Ever since then our relationship has been good. Felt like we were on same page. Enjoying time together etc. Today. 2 days before our 4 year anniversary, I see hinge again. His profile isnt completed. But why why why???? I didnt say anything because Im trying to sort myself out bc I truly just dont know. Side note: he is the one I want, we live together, have a dog together. Our lives are intertwined. We have different hobbies but yet when we are together it feels so nice. My mom currently has cancer, and Im like is he staying with me because shes sick? how would you deal with this? Would you leave him? Like I said, I love him so much, but if he truly meant no harm wouldnt he stop this? Please help. Sincerely, a girl looking for hope.",

    "title": "I 30F want to leave my husband 34M but Im a stay at home mom, what do I need to do?",
    "text": "Tw: CSA I apologize in advance for how long this post is but I am really needing some help and guidance. My husband and I have been together for over ten years now, married for almost 4. We share two children together a 3 year old and 1 year old. Ive been a stay at home mom since our eldest was born. Our marriage has been somewhat difficult since having kids however, the greatest challenges weve faced have occurred in the past 5 months. At the beginning of 2025 I decided it was time to take more control of my life. Ive been eating well and working out regularly to get to a healthy weight - Ive now lost over 50 lbs. While doing this, I also decided to go to therapy once a week to try and address all of the trauma Ive experienced in my life. Something I very rarely talked about and had never actually addressed. Since talking in therapy about my trauma, my eyes have been opened to how much its impacted me. I experienced CSA involving a close family member when I was 9 years old. I have never told anyone except for my husband a few times over the course of our relationship. I still saw the abuser regularly as he a member of my family and my husband ended up getting a job working for him. The reality of what happened was so painful for me I never allowed myself to think about it. However, since becoming a mother, my perspective on everything has changed. I no longer want to see this person, I certainly dont want my children around him ever, and Im ready to take control of my life. Im ready to not be tied down by this secret anymore. Ive worked on this a lot in therapy, and I came to the conclusion that I was going to tell my husband how I felt and ask for his support. A few days ago, I worked up the courage to address this and took the first step. I wrote a letter for my husband explaining all my thoughts, gave it to him in the evening after our kids were in bed. Told him I was going for a bike ride and then asked him to read it and we can talk when I returned. When i came home he was completely supportive of how I felt even though it meant he would likely lose his job. He said ultimately he was on my side. It felt like a great conversation and I felt reslly hopeful. Now, a few days later - my husband starts acting off. Hes angry, frustrated and irritable. While hes at work, he starts texting me how upset he actually is to be losing this job. He says hes angry that I just made this decision without him, without consulting him first. He feels he will never find another job that pays this well and he wont be able to continue to provide for our family in the way he has been. I pleaded with him, told him I want to take this slow, work up the courage to address this, and we can work together to figure out all the implications. This wasnt enough for him, he basically wants me to not do this. He spiraled the rest of the day, saying hes broken over this, saying horrible things like hell tell everyone Im crazy and side with the abuser, telling me Im selfish and not thinking of our familys wellbeing. When the kids were in bed we had a horrible argument. Both of us crying and upset. Since this fight hes maintained his position. Were busy basically not talking, Im sleeping on the couch, and were both obviously thinking through this marriage. I feel like he isnt standing beside me in one of the hardest moments of my life and hes prioritizing the wrong things. I feel completely heartbroken and find it hard to continue a marriage with someone who wouldnt support me in taking control of my life and finally feeling free. He feels so much stress about his job that he completely resents me and doesnt understand why Im deciding to make this change now. I dont think I can continue on in this marriage. I dont think he will take it well so I need to have a plan for everything before hand. I dont have any family I can go to for support as I am planning on addressing them regarding the CSA and cant be around them. I dont have a job, any recent job experience or my own bank account. What I do have: access to some money thats in my name that I inherited from a deceased family member, the car is in my name.",

He definitely treated me really well and this was the first relationship where Ive ever been treated right, despite how short term it was. And I also treated him really well too as he also recognized that and said that he wanted to protect me and didnt wanna drag me in his process. My question is that do they ever come back?

    "text": "Hi, I am past retirement age and will soon have to start taking RMDs. So Ive decided to consolidate my 3 IRA accounts into a CD at a bank. One is simple- it is at a bank and traditional. Very straightforward to do the transfer. The other two are at brokerages. Brokerage 1 is where I had had my 403 b. I rolled over my 403 b there to an IRA at the same brokerage. On my statement it is calling this a Rollover IRA Brokerage Account. This is confusing to me and to the bank where I want to open up a CD as the retirement plan was rolled over at least 10 years ago and converted I think to a Traditional IRA. My other IRA account is at a different brokerage and on the statement is termed a Self-Directed Retirement Account Traditional IRA. I want to make sure that when I transfer the funds from the brokerage accounts that the funds are not treated as distributions which are taxable. Anyone else successfully done this and have advice? I look forward to hearing from you!",

I cant tell if I need space or what. I enjoy his company and I love being around him, he treats me like a princess and has never done anything wrong. Hes probably the best thing thats ever happened to me. I havent had great relationships in the past, Ive been left with a good amount of trauma. Every time I get with somebody, I cant help but think that I hate them. Sometimes randomly I feel like I just hate my boyfriend. I know I dont, but why would i feel like that? Why would I even think that if there wasnt truth to it? Obviously, as in any relationship, he annoys me sometimes, i have a short temper and tend to be very irritable over small things, but he handles it very well, better than any past relationships. It isnt even really things he does. Its seriously just random. I get urges to leave him because all I can think is that I hate him. I dont understand. I know I have some things going on concerning my mental health and Im still actively overcoming my trauma from past relationships, but I cant tell if its in my head or if Im genuinely feeling this way.",

    "text": "Hello, this may be a long one but please bear with me. Context: I work at well known and respected brand in my industry Company A Ive been there for a full year this month and while it was and still is one of my favorite brands, I have hated my experience as an employee. Company A is American privately owned and my previous employer Company C was European owned and part of a large conglomerate so I guess I may have been spoiled when it comes to benefits, but personally, I think the way Company C operates is how all companies should. Moving on.. my manager recently went away for a couple weeks and I had to act as manager during their absence. I absolutely loathed the experience, but I managed pretty well minus one or two cry breaks. After such a negative experience, I applied to a job at Company B on a whim - they are also European owned and widely recognized in and out of the industry. Surprisingly, Ive managed to make it pretty far in the interview process I am meeting with their COO this week. Question: I am fairly certain I will be receiving a job offer from Company B by next week Mon/Tues, but the role I applied for is a managerial role which I didnt fully grasp until the first interview and I am not sure that is something I am ready for. I am sure I can handle the tasks, however, I do not deal with stress well and this is a managerial role at an international company. The role comes with a 10-20k pay bump and is hybrid, both things that sound very appealing to me. Do you think I would be able to use this job offer to get a salary bump at my current job? I hate how cheap the company is and disagree with the way the company is run but I love my team and am not sure I am ready to take on a managerial role at a larger company. If youve made it this far, thank you. Any advice would be appreciated!",

I was placed under academic probation last semester for low gpa however I was able to get it up this semester but I failed a course i got a 67 on one course. The course was 4 days long and there were many flaws to it of course i cant have that be an excuse however the professor refused to go over questions because we wouldnt have time then dismiss us early things like that , stuff like that is recorded btw. anyways this means i wont be able to remediate the course unless i appeal. what are the chances of me winning it? Ive been struggling mentally quietly for the past two years but especially last year and and im seriously contemplated suicide. im in credit card debt i work at mcdonalds i have no hope for me. my family doesnt know about any of it because they will actually kill me or disown me. and im not kidding about it. my parents will probably have a stroke im not joking. i dont know what to do. i dont want to get kicked out of the problem. but if i do i feel as though that would be the cherry on top. pharmacy school is all i have and i cant afford to lose it. what do i do?",

    "text": "Im 27 and wife is 25. She and I sold our house and netted 110k. We need 50k to put down on the next house to get the best rate for the 5 Year ARM at our credit union. They dont charge PMI. Also, I am a residential builders son and I work for our familys construction company. My wife and I plan to continue to build and sell every 2-4 years to equity farm. We live in the greater Raleigh, NC area which is one of the best real estate markets in the country so I feel very good about our ability to continue to do this. This next house should net us 300-500k when we sell. For those reasons, I dont want to put more down So, what to do with the rest of the money? Pay off the car, invest in the stock market, or invest in some other real estate like short term rentals at the beach or in the mountains? Both 2-3 hours from home and easy enough to manage with our resources in construction and real estate. The car is 45k to pay off. Its 828/mo with a 6 interest rate. This was something we did to live in the now, knowing our plan was to pay it off aggressively. I know spending on cars is not ever the best move but its a ford bronco and it makes us both super happy. Our other vehicle is a company provided truck so we dont have additional vehicle expense after the Bronco. Our take home pay after taxes is 11k ish before bonuses and commissions wife has her real estate license and we have literally no other debt beyond this car at the moment since we are renting while we build. I was liking the idea of allocating 50k toward the new home, 45k to paying off the car and keeping 15k from the sale of the home for some other investment. Would love to hear how other people would approach my situation. This money from the sale of our first home is our first windfall and I want to get the most out of it.",

I felt no remorse no guilt or anything i keep hearing the faint noises it was making every time i hit it. should i seek professional help?",

    "text": "So i have this friend who doesnt know how to take conflict. for example one time i sent her a message stating how i didnt like this one thing she did and it seemed like she put ZERO effort into her reply. and so i asked her if she meant what she said because it didnt really seem like she did. and she said yes and said she has trouble with this stuff. as in like confronting conflict in friendships. but i seriously dont believe someone can be THAT bad at like apologizing/admitting to your mistakes. she was dry as to what she did, she just said i dont care to a lot of the things i said, so it made me just wanna shutdown, so i told her i feel like it would be better just to not say anything at all instead of i dont care. oh and i told her about this the first time and she would not take me seriously at all, so in my message i said i felt disregarded and just not taken seriously and she said oh sorry i was ragebait bc thought it was funny like she also didnt use proper grammar and didnt use i which leads me to believe there was zero effort there idm if you think im sensitive for feeling this way abt what she said to me but its more of how she took it yk? anywho, in general shes a good friend and i imagine my days would be harder if i didnt have her, but ive talked to other friends and they agree that some of her jokes dont really come off as jokes more just rude do i ghost her?... or what do i do? do i just bring up the lack of communication she delivers if theres another time this happens?",

    "text": "During the Spring 2024 semester in my college I was slowly slipping on my classes. Before this I took my classes seriously but nearing the end of the semester I started studying less and doing homework less. I even did not study for my physics final at all but luckily i still passed. But the trend continued in the next semester and it became even more extreme. I would not do my homework on the weekends and if i did it would be last minute. For my chemistry class I did not study at all for the final and i ended up with a C. I usually get an A or B. Additionally during this time i would just stay in bed the whole day on weekends and just play games. During the worst of times id wake up and not eat anything till like 7 pm or 8 pm but that was only once in a blue moon. I didnt exercise and i barely moved around since i was in bed all day. I always felt agitated and annoyed especially by my mom but sometimes my other family members. I feel like i was more quick to anger and more moody. Now this semester I have a C in my psychology class and I might fail physics. I have my final coming up next week and I havent studied for any of the physics tests at all this semester. I know 100 this is my fault but I dont know why i dont have any motivation to do anything this past year. I havent told my family so they think i am still getting As and Bs. I recently started making a goal to do at least 30 minutes of homework per day and i succeeded and now i am doing 45 minutes of homework at least. I plan to continue scaling it up and I am slowly fixing my sleep schedule. I even saw my colleges mental health counselor for the first time and I told her what was happening. I even go for a run sometimes. I dont know what to do still. Im so scared to tell my family that I have been slipping on my academics. I feel like a disappointment and sometimes i cant even look at my moms face because i feel too ashamed and a big disappointment. I havent told anyone other than the mental health counselor at my school recently and Im lying to all my family and friends.",

    "text": "1 Month after break up - yet my ex seems happier than ever Hi everyone for a little background my 29F partner 29M are about 1 month post breakup now. Weve been together for about 7 years but never tied the knot just due to personal finance reasons but we do have our own home and 3 year old child together. The entire year of 2025 has been tough on my mental state. I am a stay at home mom and I just completely lost who I am and had no light in sight. About 4 months ago I started bringing up the idea of breaking things off yet My partner throughout the year has constantly reassured me that he still loves me and this is the hardest part of our relationship that if we can get through will make us stronger and suggesting that if i get some help itll help my mental start becoming clear. Unfortunately because of my mental state everyday im just more and more consumed with how horrible i am feeling about life and just not feeling like my own person anymore. After me constantly telling me partner i dont know about us anymore he finally just couldnt take it and to my shock agreed to decide to part ways. Im now seeing a therapist for some help on getting back to a good mental state but now that were a month post breakup i see his life flourishing it looks like. Hes now hanging around old friends, always around family and even more with our son. He takes him everywhere a baseball game, to see events, horses etc. and i just dont know why he never did all that when we were together. I know i shouldnt feel this envy but i just feel like all this breakup did was remind him how amazing life could be without me meanwhile i have a new job that im not particularly fond of that eats up my entire day and i just feel like this is the end of the road for me to just rot here. I could really use some advice or even if anyone has had similar experiences where you felt like you initiated a breakup but then felt like it was the worst thing for you but the best thing for them : Thank you all for reading",

    "title": "Loosing a friend, and I dont know what to do",
    "text": "This is all very recent and very hurtful, so please be careful with your words! For context: this all started about three weeks ago. I have a friend Girl 1 that I have became really close to. We have been friends for about a year or a bit more, but we just seemed to click. About three weeks or so, she came back from vacation. During this vacation, she got very ill, so I summed up her behavior to her sickness. As she started to get better, I noticed that she was acting strange with me. One word answers, always on her phone, not texting, etc. This is usual behavior, so I asked her in person, and she just said shes tired. I text her about it later that day, and she doesnt say anything. I assume she just feels ill, so I let it be. The next day in class, she doesnt talk to me, but she talks to the other kids in my class just fine. I signaled a mutual friend Girl 2 to come and I asked her if she noticed if Girl 1 was acting weird, and Girl 2 said she was also doing the same thing to her. We let it be, as we do not want to pry or annoy her. Later that day, I rode with Girl 1 to school, and she was silent. I asked her if I had done or said something to upset her, and she did not respond to me. I tried to not take it personally and let her be. Later that day, Girl 1 pulled me aside and told me that on her trip she did a lot of reflecting, and realized that she always felt inferior to Girl 2, that Girl 2 had habits of hurting Girl 1s feelings, and that she was mad at me for never standing up to Girl 2. I apologized and had a long concern with her, and encouraged Girl 1 to talk to Girl 2. The next day, Girl 1 was speaking to me, but ignoring Girl 2. In the afternoon, Girl 1 almost called Girl 2 to talk about her feelings, but decided against it. I recently found out that, that same weekend, Girl 1 apologized for being distant towards Girl 2 and told her she would talk to her one of these days. Fast forward the next week, everything was fine. We all, including other friends, acted and hung out fine. This brings us to this Monday. Girl 1 was acting cold again Monday. She spoke to me, but mostly focused on her phone. I started noticing on Instagram, that she was liking Friendship breakup posts and posts about cutting off toxic people. I tried to assume the best, maybe they were older posts, but it did bother me. Today, Wednesday, I walked into class and greeted her, and she acted as if I was not even there. She completely ignored me, even when I greeted her twice. The rest of the class, I just focused on my work, but I was tearing up, as I felt sad. Today, she proceeded to ignore me all day, and posted shady things that I feel are targeting me and Girl 2. On Instagram, videos she likes keep showing up, and all of them are about cutting people off. The one that really upset me was one that said something along the lines of when a girl who wont defend you against mean girls tries to be your friend and in the background was lady gagas bad romance the part that sounds like she is saying i dont wanna be friends This felt targeted as she explicitly told me she had been mad at me for not standing up for her. Ive been upset all day, as we went from being close, texting, laughing, etc, to all of the sudden reposting things about cutting people off and completely ignoring me. I dont want to force her to talk to me or explain anything, but I dont know what to do. This is really hurting me. Please help!",

His sister has not spoken with their parents in over a year and his parents have not met their 2nd grandchild. I understand the concept of no contact but in this situation no abuse or gaslighting was involved. The sister just simply doesnt want advice from her parents and chose to cut them off out of now where. She also cut off her husbands parents as well. She told us recently she will not come to our wedding if the parents are there. Im not asking her to talk to the parents, the parents know not to talk to them but she said unless I uninvite them she will not come and she will cut off my fiancé from his nieces as well. I believe she is being very selfish and trying to make a day thats supposed to be about her brother and I, about her. What can I do in this situation?",

How can I heal from this breach of trust, the betrayal and just overall big/heavy feelings? I love him with all of my being and I dont ever want to part ways. Hes my soulmate, my world, my everything and I want better for us Please no suggestions on me leaving him or anything of that sort tysm!! I just want to know how we can better move forward, grow/heal together as a couple Thanks so much for reading!!",

    "title": "My boyfriend 29M promised marriage and a future, now says hes unsure I 20F feel manipulated and confused?",
    "text": "Hi everyone. I need honest thoughts because I feel emotionally confused, stuck, and a little manipulated. I 20F have been with my boyfriend 29M for about 6 months. We met online, and things moved fast he flew to my country soon after and has stayed with me for long periods. But he still lives with a female housemate, and even though he promised hed move out once things got serious, that never happened. He says its because of money, but hes not even trying to find a better job or new place. It feels like an excuse. At the beginning of our relationship, he talked constantly about marriage and having kids. He told me I was the woman he wanted to build a life with even talked about he wanted to marry this April , wanted to make baby with me force me to have pill, and how he couldnt wait to start a family with me. I started to believe in those dreams. But now, he says he was just caught in the moment and didnt really mean it. Hes said this multiple times after getting my hopes up. And now he says he might want marriage after therapy that he needs to figure himself out first. This sudden shift has been painful. I didnt ask for those promises he gave them freely. And now I feel like Im the one left holding all the weight of the disappointment. It got worse when I thought I might be pregnant once. I was scared and emotional and during that time, I found out he was watching porn. It crushed me. I felt so alone and disrespected, like my pain didnt matter. There was also an Instagram situation. He deleted his main account to earn my trust, but I later found out he had another hidden account. The entire feed was filled with OnlyFans-type models. He never told me about this account, and he was looking at it during one of my most stressful days. He never admitted he watched it, and when I told him how hurt I felt, he called me insecure and even accused me of being borderline. I dont feel like I can trust him anymore. When I bring these things up, he cries or gets defensive. He makes me feel like Im overreacting or too emotional. I feel like I always have to be the calm, forgiving one, while he doesnt take responsibility for how he makes me feel. He says he still loves me and wants to work things out one day. But Im exhausted. I dont know if I should wait, or if Im just holding on to something thats already broken. This feels manipulative at times especially considering the 9-year age gap between us and I dont know how much more I can carry on like this. So what now? TLDR: My boyfriend 29M gave me dreams of marriage and a future, but later said he was just caught in the moment and now says he might want marriage after therapy. He still lives with a female roommate, hid a secret Instagram full of OnlyFans-type content, and makes me feel guilty when I bring up my feelings. I feel emotionally drained and unsure if this relationship is even real anymore.",

    "text": "I have a relatively small inner circle of friends who I am close with. The one in question here can be a little difficult to communicate/plan with, and sometimes gives vague/late answers that make planning things unnecessarily complicated. I want to make it clear that despite this I consider them a close friend, and have known them for all 4 years of University. The important complication here is that we graduate very soon, meaning I have limited time to patch things up. Yesterday evening 24hrs ago 4 of us were hanging out and he mentioned that he felt he had been targeted with a bit of banter going around the group. Everyone has been the recipient of this and it is not serious at all, but he and one other friend do get it a little more. We got a little defensive and said it was because they were a bit flakey the other guy is very self aware of it and doesnt mind. He got upset and asked for an example, and I brought up a time recently where we had planned something, and after we had already arrived he texted that he was going to do something else first and arrived an hour late. I think I should have let it go, but everyone was on my side and it got a little heated, although in my head at the time I wasnt trying to offend him. He got upset and stopped talking to us. I sent him an apology today which he said he appreciated, but he seemed distant and politely declined any attempt to hang out. Whats the play here? My other friends think hes being over-sensitive and to leave him alone. I dont think what I said was factually wrong, but I do think that 3 of us ganging up on him was unnecessary and I really dont care about being right with so little time left together. Do I keep asking him to do stuff/act like normal or just back off?",

    "title": "My boyfriend 29M promised marriage and a future, now says hes unsure I 20F feel manipulated and confused",
    "text": "Hi everyone. I need honest thoughts because I feel emotionally confused, stuck, and a little manipulated. I 20F have been with my boyfriend 29M for about 6 months. We met online, and things moved fast he flew to my country soon after and has stayed with me for long periods. But he still lives with a female housemate, and even though he promised hed move out once things got serious, that never happened. He says its because of money, but hes not even trying to find a better job or new place. It feels like an excuse. At the beginning of our relationship, he talked constantly about marriage and having kids. He told me I was the woman he wanted to build a life with even talked about he wanted to marry this April , wanted to make baby with me force me to have pill, and how he couldnt wait to start a family with me. I started to believe in those dreams. But now, he says he was just caught in the moment and didnt really mean it. Hes said this multiple times after getting my hopes up. And now he says he might want marriage after therapy that he needs to figure himself out first. This sudden shift has been painful. I didnt ask for those promises he gave them freely. And now I feel like Im the one left holding all the weight of the disappointment. It got worse when I thought I might be pregnant once. I was scared and emotional and during that time, I found out he was watching porn. It crushed me. I felt so alone and disrespected, like my pain didnt matter. There was also an Instagram situation. He deleted his main account to earn my trust, but I later found out he had another hidden account. The entire feed was filled with OnlyFans-type models. He never told me about this account, and he was looking at it during one of my most stressful days. He never admitted he watched it, and when I told him how hurt I felt, he called me insecure and even accused me of being borderline. I dont feel like I can trust him anymore. When I bring these things up, he cries or gets defensive. He makes me feel like Im overreacting or too emotional. I feel like I always have to be the calm, forgiving one, while he doesnt take responsibility for how he makes me feel. He says he still loves me and wants to work things out one day. But Im exhausted. I dont know if I should wait, or if Im just holding on to something thats already broken. This feels manipulative at times especially considering the 9-year age gap between us and I dont know how much more I can carry on like this. So what now? TLDR: My boyfriend 29M gave me dreams of marriage and a future, but later said he was just caught in the moment and now says he might want marriage after therapy. He still lives with a female housemate, hid a secret Instagram full of OnlyFans-type content, and makes me feel guilty when I bring up my feelings. I feel emotionally drained and unsure if this relationship is even real anymore.",

    "text": "Location: Alberta Canada I got in an accident because I went through a yellow light late and a guy turned left and hit me when i was going straight. The cop at the scene told me that he had two witnesses from both sides of the intersection saying that I ran the red light at a high rate of speed. My question is can I get two witnesses of my own to give a statement and their name and phone number for my lawyer to take to court in order to fight the cops two witnesses? If I can how would I go about doing that in a way that is acceptable for the court, can I just get a signed statement from them or do I need an email or something?",

My ex and I broke up a year and a half ago and we remained friends. I started dating my boyfriend monogamously almost a year ago. I am planning a trip with my ex I hate that I have to refer to him as that cause we really are just friends now for two nights and I have asked my boyfriend about it before I started planning it. He seemed fine with it but now looking back maybe the response as long as you guys dont fuck isnt really giving hes 100 fine with it. I am 100 willing to cancel my trip if he doesnt feel comfortable with me going but before I ask him again, is there anything I can do to make him feel more comfortable? side note: I am not asking if you would feel comfortable with your partner hanging out with their ex.",

    "text": "Im posting this because I dont know where else to turn. Im genuinely heartbroken and need help or guidance from anyone whos been through something similar. On April 16, I went to a detangling specialist for what was supposed to be a simple session to help with a single knot in my hair. Instead, he severely damaged my hair brushing it aggressively, applying some unknown product, and blow-drying it into my hair without rinsing. My scalp was in pain, and my hair became severely matted to the point of being glued together. I left crying, humiliated, and traumatized. While I was in distress, the stylist took my credit card and charged me 250 for a second appointment I never agreed to. He made that appointment on his own less than 24 hours in advance and charged my card without my clear or informed consent. I never went back. I couldnt. I was in pain and emotionally wrecked. In total, I was charged 375 for this nightmare 125 for the first session that caused the damage, and 250 for a follow-up I didnt authorize and didnt attend. I immediately filed disputes with Discover. I submitted detailed letters, photo evidence, receipts, and a statement from a licensed stylist who helped me recover. I had to spend over 700 to repair the damage he caused. Discover still sided with the merchant. They said they dont cover negligent or harmful services, and that because I was physically at the appointment, they consider the charge valid even the 250 I didnt agree to. Is this normal? Does Discover not protect consumers from damage, coercion, or unauthorized charges if the card is physically present? Is there anything I can still do CFPB? Small claims court? I feel so defeated. I didnt ask for this. I just wanted help with my hair, and now Im traumatized and financially drained trying to fix the damage. If anyone has advice or experience, please let me know. Thank you so much. Location: Houston",

    "text": "My partner 35m proposed to me 25f tonight, and I said yes. I honestly thought he was joking at first. I will preface this with: I have diagnosed OCD and PTSD from past abuse, so I may have perception problems. We also both have high functioning autism. We have been together since late 2023, and known eachother for 8 years. We have never fought, he has always been kind and calm. I will now get on to the problems: -We have had multiple talks about him being emotionally absent since my basically father died in December. They never met, but my partner said it effected him deeply. His emotional absence during the death and for months afterward have effected my self confidence greatly. I even believed he was cheating on me because of the emotional abscence. My partner knows this. The last month has been a little better on that front. -I am the main provider. I pay all of our rent and utilities. He moved in with me around mid 2024. I dont mind this, but I would rather us work 50/50 on trying to get out of this little apartment. I want a future with a home and good jobs, etc. He has more of a passive mindset, and has said Wherever you go, I will follow. Which is extremely sweet, but i want him to want to work towards our future. In short, I have felt insecure in myself and our relationship in a few ways, but I really love him. I have been abused a good deal, so maybe I have just been overthinking as well. Outside perspectives? People who have been through this? Do I just need more therapy? I dont want to be anxious about this just because I am traumatized. He really is the most loving and kind partner when he isnt absent, and the absence seems to be a coping mechanism.",

I was going to collage in Canada while im from the states. When i returned my mom insisted i get a job in exchange for living in the garage, which is fair given the price of rent around here. Anyways she asked that i go talk to a recruiter for the military which i did, i talked to two different recruiters from different branches. I got home and told my mom about the navy one, she asked if i was going to join and i said i wasnt sure. For whatever reason she took this opportunity to tell everyone in our immediate family that i decided to join, i definitely didnt but that was a couple months ago. Im not good at standing up for myself when faced with my mom. Im supposed to swear in on Friday and i really dont want to. Im considering just leaving in my truck but since i pay her rent which yes wasnt the original agreement i barely have any savings from my job. I would like to go back to collage but i dont think thats possible at this point. Any advice on how to proceed with trying to figure something else out or get my parents and mainly mom to understand it isnt what i want?",

It wasnt nasty or anything like that, just a question about the appropriate time to resend an email after a week when theyre out of office. It was though, slightly specific enough to be identified. Coincidentally, said professor emails me the same day of the post. My email had been sent a while ago - meaning it was buried. She is also still on leave. Possibly she couldve just remembered suddenly, but this feels too convenient? My account had nothing inappropriate on it, I literally only used the account for college questions but well, the comments... the professor helped me a lot this semester. She ended up being my all time favorite. I was extremely grateful and mentioned it a few times in my comments, including to reassure someone that professors arent super scary and can be nice. Im afraid though, that if she read it from the outside it looked like I was bragging or taking advantage of her kindness. I also had a comment within my schools subreddit, so its even more obvious its. me. Worst part? I have to see this professor again. A lot. I need advice on how to feel like, less awkward around her now that she possibly saw those comments? Is there any sort of hack to just ignore that someone knows you gushed about them to several people in reddit comments?",

    "text": "Hey Reddit, Im a 22M and Ive been with my girlfriend 20F for about 5 months now. I made a mistake that Im not proud of, and its really eating me up inside. To give some context, my girlfriend has a difficult past and doesnt feel comfortable with sex or anything oral-related. I knew this, and while I never forced her, I would ask about it. Looking back, I realize how that mightve made it seem like thats all I cared about but thats not true. Ive come to understand I have a problem with lust. In my previous relationship, sex was a big part of it, and I guess I got conditioned to think thats what a relationship was supposed to be. But I was wrong really wrong and I want to change. Recently, we had a falling out. I begged her not to leave, told her Id change, and owned up to my mistake. Ive never raised my voice at her or argued Ive always supported her, but I know I messed up by letting lust drive me instead of love. She told me she still loves me and knows I love her too, but said she doesnt know what to do anymore. Eventually, she said: Lets be friends for a little while not forever, just for a bit so you can earn my trust back. Then propose to me before I leave. Shes leaving for the military in 3 weeks. I agreed. Since then, Ive been doing my best to show her how much I love her sending her voice messages, songs, texts, just trying to be consistent and genuine. But heres the thing: her responses feel dry. Its like she doesnt care. Maybe thats just my overthinking, but it feels like all the good from the past 5 months has disappeared from her mind. I dont want to lose her. Im trying to learn and grow from this. I really do love her deeply, and this pain is overwhelming. Can anyone give me some advice on what to do or how to handle this? Im just really lost right now. Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "Hey everyone, Im 24F, single, no kids, and currently live at home rent-free. I make about 100K a year, my car is paid off, and my only fixed monthly expenses are 150 for car insurance and 90 for my phone. I have about 30,000 in credit card debt that has gone to collections, and I havent started paying it off yet. I know thats a major financial red flag, and I want to get serious about tackling itbut Im unsure if I should aggressively pay it off now or take a slower approach while also investing. My net monthly income is around 6,000, and I want to start putting that money to good use. Im super interested in investing, especially day trading and index funds. Ive been learning online, but this whole world is still very new to me. I didnt grow up in a financially literate family, so Im teaching myself as I goand would really appreciate any advice or guidance from people whove been in similar situations or have experience in investing. My main goal is to achieve financial freedom and eventually leave the 95 lifestyle. I want to be able to work on my own time and terms, and day trading really appeals to me as a path that could help me get there. I know it takes skill and discipline, but Im willing to put in the work to learn. Some things Im trying to figure out: Should I aggressively pay off my collections debt first or pay it off slowly while investing? For someone in my position, is it better to focus on long-term investments like index funds or get into day trading? What would a smart monthly budget look like for me? How much should I allocate to debt, savings, and investing? Any resources, courses, or beginner-friendly platforms youd recommend? Thanks in advance for any help or advice! Im really excited to learn and start building a smarter financial future.",

    "text": "This is absolutely embarrassing I hate this so much. Throwaway account. TLDR: Professor may of found my account through a slightly specific neutral post about her. My comments make it more obvious its me, as I talked about how she helped me in several of them. I have a professor who I really enjoy and has helped me through a lot. I have had as Ive deleted it in a panic a reddit which is literally just college stuff. Nothing inappropriate, I just have anxiety so I choose to ask questions on academic subreddits and then delete the posts after I have my answers. I also occasionally comment, as in I had like less than 10 comments on the profile. One comment was on a post on my university subreddit. The others were just general advice and reassuring that professors are not evil and how to navigate tough situations with professors. Mostly because I had a horrible semester and my professors were so absolutely accommodating withour me asking while I struggled. Particularly, one professor. This professor got mentioned in a few comments as I was absolutely grateful for her kindness and is a great example of how professors can be really nice. This is important, I swear. I made a post today asking about resending an email while the professor was on leave. The email had been sent a while ago. I checked the post after a nap, found comments about calendars. I then check my email. The professor sent me a link to a calendar and an email back. Shes still on leave. That email was sent so long ago that it could not be easy to find. Maybe she suddenly remembered me and was like hm, lets check. Still its, so coincidental. Im so embarrassed if she figured out it was me, especially because it was such a stupid question I literally just have the worst anxiety. Its even worse if she found the comments because theyre both so gushy but also could be seen as me taking advantage of her generosity. I know there isnt too much to do in this situation. Unfortunately, I have to see her again. Im already an awkward student who comes off crush-y. Is there a way to power through someone finding your Reddit account?",
