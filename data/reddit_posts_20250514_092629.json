    "text": "I have a friend who can be a real gaslighter and piece of shit at times. Im starting to get turned off by him because he has a habit of making plans but not inviting the whole friend group but then when he gets called out on it, he loses it and claims hes innocent. But hell lose his shit when hes excluded from something yet when he does it, its okay. Like in the past hed get mad at someone in the group for no good reason on top of that, and then hed come to me and be like if this person asks whats happening on the weekend, just tell them nothing because I really dont want this person coming. And then hed go off on me because I told him Im not doing that as thats just wrong and fucked up to lie to people like that. Thing is Ive caught him using those exact same tactics on me yet whenever I call him out, he calls me crazy and says Im making assumptions and comes up with all these excuses to cover his ass. But I know when he lies because he literally uses these same lies on other people and Id often be the only one who knew he was lying. But what I dont like is that he flips the whole thing around on me and doesnt take any accountability. Hes a textbook narcissist and gaslighter. Another thing he does is well all be hanging out and hell be like next weekend ima plan this for whoevers down but then as the week goes on, hell only follow up with the people that he wants to come. For the others hell come to me and be like yeah im just not gonna mention it to them again that way they know theyre uninvited. And I straight up told him that what he does is fake but he disagrees. Also if he has an issue with someone, hell tell everyone but that person. And Ive told him how do I know youre not doing the same with me. He reassured me hes not but this guy lies so much that you never kniow. Anyways he did the same to me this weekend. He was like next weekend were gonna go watch the game at this bar but then was radio silent during the week which isnt like him, because if he wants you coming to something, he will follow up with you 100 times as he has OCD. So I texted him and was like by when do u need an answer by for friday and hes like by wednedsay and Im like when did you plan on telling me that? and he was like i already told you in person so why would i mention it again. But then I asked him why he didnt put a message in the gc he usually does and hes like nah im only inviting people who i wanna invite and i straight up told him then whats the point of the groupchat if you make plans but leave people out? Im sick of dealing with him but hes very interconnected with my friend group. If I cut him off, thatll mean I wont see the group as much as hes usually the one who plans stuff in the group. Hes a very controlling individual and its honestly discouraging that Im the only one who stands up to him and puts him in his place. The other people in our group are either scared of him or idk, they only hang around him because he plans parties and trips and stuff and he acts like he cares about people but deep down he only cares about himself. Hes also a massive hypocrite. Calls me out for using my phone during hangouts even tho hes on his own for the ENTIRE time yet he denies it. He has a rumour in my city of being a master manipulator. My question to yall is what do I do? How can I approach him and put him in his place? Every time Ive tried, he just gaslights and calls me insane and says I need help.",

    "title": "Feel trapped in life",
    "text": "For context: I met my wife in high school when we were 15 and dated on and off throughout high school mostly on. She moved away the summer before our senior year to a different state and we broke up because of it but kept in touch somewhat, but not really. We both dated other people and had pretty serious relationships with other people, but it never felt the same as when we were with each other or so I had thought. I ended up reaching back out to her our sophomore year of college basically confessing my love to her while she was dating another guy. Long story short, she broke up with the guy who turned out to be super mentally abusive and totally traumatized her and then she moved back to where I lived and we started talking again. She was so traumatized that every night we spent together she was shoving alcohol down her throat and was hysterically crying for hours in my arms about this guy and the way he treated her and the things he did. It was miserable, but I kept through it because I thought I loved her and it was the right thing to do. We spent the entire summer like this, albeit we did have a relationship as she didnt want to have a boyfriend so quickly after, but we were both definitely in love with each other and it was obvious but she didnt want the label of a relationship. At the end of the summer, we both ended up going to 2 different colleges in completely different states and she ended things because she didnt want to do distance, but I did want to but just let it happen because of the circumstances with her last relationship and I didnt want to rush her. When we both got to college, things were very different. She would ignore any texts or phone calls and would hang out with other people and not talk to me anymore, and almost kind of act like the entire summer didnt happen and act like I didnt even matter/exist after I spent hours upon hours with her helping her as she cried hysterically each night and helped her get through her trauma. Keep in mind I was very vocal with her during the summer that I wanted to keep dating when we left for school and was fine doing distance, but we didnt because she didnt want to. A few weeks into college, I reconnected with my previous ex girlfriend that also went to the same college I did and we began to talk and rekindle things a bit, and ending up getting together. The next week, the girl who was at the other college ending up driving up to where I was at and surprised me and told me she all of the sudden wanted to do distance and had decided she made a mistake a wanted to be with me. This all went great until I posted her on my Snapchat story saying something along the lines of look who came to visit! Me, not thinking, didnt realize the girl I was rekindling things with would see this and see it as me cheating. So she messaged the girl who drove up to surprise me and told her that we had gotten together and been talking and basically accused me of cheating I will admit, I definitely should have told her about everything that happened, but it was so sudden and such a surprise that I didnt think about it at the time. The girl who drove up to surprise me immediately left and blocked me on everything and wouldnt talk to me. I was distraught and didnt know what to do and thought that the girl who drove up to surprise me was the girl I wanted to be with ultimately because I felt like a bad person and felt like it was the right thing to do I never actually took the time to sit down and decide what it was I really wanted, I just wanted to make things right. Long story short, she eventually began talking to me again and we fixed things and started dating officially and began to do distance, but it was very rough - constant fighting and isolation from all of my friends, and I couldnt even hang out with friends because she would get so jealous. Looking back, I can now see the light and see the problems that came of this. I began to ignore the friends I had and friends I had made up at my college to help the relationship along and had completely lost myself in the process isolating me from everyone that lived there and began drinking a lot with her. Fast forward down the line, we got married a couple of years later and I thought I was happy, until I began to see the same things during college happen after we were married. I became extremely isolated in my relationship with her and now have 0 friends and see my family much less than I used to. Im now 2 years deep into this marriage and all I can think about all day every day is my ex girlfriend who I cheated on my wife with and how much I now know that the reason we rekindled things was maybe because it was meant to be, and the girl moving states to come be with me that summer showed me that. Maybe that was gods way of showing me a different, happier path in life. I am so in love with this girl that I havent seen or talked to in years, but theres nothing I can do about it because I feel like Ive been manipulated into a marriage and life with this other person. All I think about all day everyday is this other girl and I would give anything to be able to go back in time and change the way that everything happened. So this is what I ask, what do I do? I am at such an impasse in life because this is not at all how i imagined my life at this point. I didnt think i would be drinking so heavily because of my wife and her habits, and nor did i ever want to drink like this. Every time I try to talk to her about it, I am guilted to all hell about it and when I try to stop or take a break and tell her, she manipulates me into drinking again with her so that she can feel better about her own drinking. Its even gotten to the point where Ive told her I need a break and that Im going to take a break for a long time from drinking, and she will say so are you going to judge me if I keep drinking or if I buy another bottle of alcohol? It feels like its at the point where she cant live with her own addiction and that I feel I have to support her and drink with her or else we fight very intensely and i end up being the bad guy. What do I do? I feel so stuck and have given up so many opportunities and friendships because of my wife and everything that comes with being married to her. Am I the bad guy in this scenario? Or do I need to be more stern? I cant continue like this, and I am miserable most of the time being with her. I am at the point where she either needs to make a change or I need to leave. I dont know what to do. I will also mention that this decision and my future doesnt rest on the other girl. I do not feel this way entirely because of the other girl, but a combination of everything that has been brewing since that whole situation of cheating happened. Please help me Reddit. : For more clarity, I also want to add that my current relationship with my wife has completely degraded and now feels more like a friendship than it does a relationship. We rarely have sensual relations and when we do its because of me pushing for it and not because of her. It feels more like work than it does a relationship at this point. I think we wouldve been better off as friends rather than a married couple. A lot of this has to do with her extreme anxiety and inability to live a normal life because of her anxiety without taking medication. The funny part is she cant take her anxiety medication while drinking, so instead Im the one who has to suffer because of it.",

    "text": "Im interested in buying 30k car. Id put down 10,000. I really dont want monthly payments more than 500 if I can avoid it, but also, want to pay as little interest as possible obviously. Currently, theres an offer from the car company for 0.9 interest for 36 months. I probably need something more along the lines of 60 months for my monthly payments to be where Id want them at. According to their loan payment calculator, it ends up being like 600/month with the 36 months offer. Im new to car buying. I have very good credit almost 800. I have some questions. This may be stupid I dont know. If I do the 0.9 interest for 36 months, do I HAVE to make the 600/month payments. I was kind of under the impression that the loan is like a credit card where as long as youre making the minimum payment, youre good. Even if you accrue interest. So will I be locked into 600/month payments like do they break down the loan amount and split it equally over the 36 months?OR could they work with you to make a lower monthly payment 300 or 400 and then when the 0.9 offer is up, do some kind of balance transfer with 0 fee/APR I get a lot of these offers and then just continue making the payments for the next 2 years or however long it takes. I guess the easiest way to ask this question is when car companies offer these 0 or 1 interest offers, does the entire loan HAVE to be paid within that period?",

    "text": "TLDR: He lied about getting multiple DUIs and its really bothering me. I want to know if this can be fixed? Me23F and my current bf 27M are going through a rough patch right now. Weve been together 2 going on 3 years. In the past, hes lied about small things but promised to be honest with me moving forward. He lied about having a child, and a few other things but I understand because he wanted me to get to know him first and I got over that because I understand. After a short break he got better and really started being honest with me. He showed me proof and everything. However, recently, he lied about something that I have a hard time getting over. He lied about losing his license, how long he was losing it for, and why he lost it. Apparently it was over multiple DUIs. I could get into the details but I guess he was ashamed about it. Hes a great man and hes there for me and takes care of me. And I genuinely love him. However, this hurt. I continued confronting him about it and he came clean but Im having a hard time getting over it. He told me that his DUIs should have no effect on our relationship and that Im not being understanding and supportive. He was there for me when I was in school helped me study so I would feel awful leaving him at his worst. He was doing better with lying and I understand why he felt shame and I dont want to end something good but its hard. He thinks im upset with him because he cant drive but im just upset he wasnt honest from the jump. I did say Im considering a break up and he says Ill never do better than him, and I dont want to. I genuinely care about this man and he feels remorseful atleast. Im in a foreign country and hes my only friend currently. We dont live together. I dont know how to move forward from here. Can this be fixed? Maybe through therapy of some sort? Who else has gone through this?",

I make a lot of stupid brainrot jokes like skibidi toilet stuff and things along those lines and Im worried that instead of finding it silly, he will get the ick. Does anyone have advice for me to soothe my nerves or help me with going forward in this relationship? I want to prove that even if Im a bit immature in some areas that overall I am a very mature person.",

But I have started to conclude that the friendship does not exist. The person has many other friends at work who they go clubbing with etc. but she does not want to initiate to do things with me. One time I have talked to her about going somewhere and she said yes. When I asked her about which day she could. She never responded and 2 months went by. And when we saw each at work she acts like she does not remember it. She only talks with me at work if she needs help with something. Or else she talks with the other colleagues. And make plans with them after work. I have started to feel like I am very small. And I feel bad about myself. I dont understand why these things always happens to me. I am so fed up with this person that I decided to delete them of social media. And now I am afraid of was going to happen next time we work together. And see if she has seen it or not. I have tried one time in work to not initiate conversations with her. Then she started talking to me, but when I started to talk to her back. After we had a break, she is becoming distant and dont care about me again. I feel like this is all a game, because she wants me to help her at work. I think its very toxic. And dont know what to do. Or if Im just being weird about it",

    "text": "Hi everyone, I 24F have been in a short term long-distance relationship with my boyfriend 26M for a few months now. We were together in person before the distance started, and things felt amazing connected, affectionate, secure. But ever since weve been apart, things have changed, and I dont know if what Im experiencing is normal or if Im being unreasonable. When we first started the distance, we called almost every day and texted a lot. But over time, hes gotten more distant he doesnt work anymore and mostly spends time at home with his friends on discord. He says hes tired of being on his phone all the time and that its exhausting to maintain long conversations. He still sends short texts here and there, but I often feel like Im the one pushing for connection. When I bring up how I feel anxious, insecure, sad about the lack of closeness, he says Im always bringing up the same issues and that hes doing his best. He also said things like I never asked for this when I was crying and needing reassurance which really hurt. I dont want to be a burden. I know I can be anxious and sensitive. Im trying to be understanding, but I also feel like Im suppressing my needs just to keep the peace. Its gotten to a point where I dont even want to express myself anymore because Im scared of annoying him. Thats not how I want to feel in a relationship. Were supposed to see each other again soon, part of me is very excited and hopeful that being together in person will fix things because when we are together, things are genuinely good. But Im also scared that the emotional damage or distance between us now might not go away. So I guess Im asking: Am I too much for needing more emotional closeness? And has anyone been through something like this and had it get better once reunited? Thanks for reading. Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.",

    "title": "My girlfriend F18 is asking me M22 to choose between my friend and her. What are my next steps?",
    "text": "Its a long story so bear with me: Ive been dating my girlfriend for 5 months and we are in a long-distance relationship. I met her online and we talked for almost a month and a half before seeing each other. The only reason why I got the chance to see her in person is because I already had plans to visit my friendswho happen to live in the same country as her one I met back in uni and the other is her friend of my uni friend, both are female. Before we started dating, my girlfriend was totally fine with me having those female friendsI made sure that she knew their existence because I am an open book and have nothing to hide. I wanted her to know them so she would feel more secured. She never said anything back then about feeling uncomfortable with that. I also have another online friend from that same country, weve been online friends for 3 years but I have never seen her before. Nothing romantic has ever happened between us, and weve been respectful. I consider her as a good friend who gives me good advice and I do value her opinion because I think I can learn a lot from her since she is a very intelligent and eloquent person. As for my girlfriend, she is a very very sweet person who is loving and loyal, there are a lot of good things about her, and everything about her is amazing, and I do love her. But once we got into a relationship, she became really skeptical of my female friends. Ever since I got back, she gets upset whenever I call my friends which is not often, just the occasional check-in. She always happened to call me when Im on the phone with my friends and she hated it. She told me that she should be the only girl I see and talk to, as if I see my friends more than just friends. She always makes assumptions and it makes me feel terribleespecially when I already try to reassure her as much as I can. The thing is she is very sensitive about social media and anything involving another women. She told me that I shouldnt post any other women but her. For example, the netflix series YOU just came out and I reposted a poster of that show with Joe surrounded by girls. She told me to remove it cuz it made her feel uncomfortable, and that other people will misinterprete it. Same thing if I post a song by a female artistit bothers her simply because the singer is a woman. She also told me not to like posts by other womeneven celebrities or content creatorsbecause others can see it and, again, might misinterpret it. To me, this all feels really controlling. I dont feel like Im disrespecting her, but I also feel restricted from using my own social media the way I want to. Yet, she says its disrespectful if I follow or like posts by other women. The second time I visited her, my friends wanted to meet up. Since I was only there for a week, I get why she wanted to spend as much time together as possibleI did too. She suggested the four of us her, me, and my two friends hang out together, and I was totally down for that. But my friends wanted to catch up with just me first, and then have her join us later so they could all meet. My girlfriend didnt like that idea and said no. She got really upset and we argued about it. So I didnt meet up with my friends at all, and they were kind of mad at me for it, since they thought it wasnt a big deal and we dont know when well see each other again. I hated being put on the spot like that cuz it really stressed me out. A few days later, my girlfriend and I went to a club together and everything seemed finewe were having a lot of fun. But while I was on my phone, she saw that my online friend had texted me earlier that day. Out of nowhere, she said shed hated that friend for a long time and told me to remove her from Instagram. We got into another argument and she told a group of random girls at the club that I cheated on her which wasnt trueshe later admitted she was just hot-headed. I felt awful because I hate being accused of something I didnt do. I tried to explain and set the record straight because I dont want people thinking Im a cheater. She did apologize afterwards but told me she genuinely doesnt like me being friends with that girl. After I got back, we kept arguing over this and at one point she told me to choose between her and my friend. She told me that I should pritotize her feelings over everyone because she is my partner. But to me, as long as no boundaries are crossed and unless there is a legitimate reason, I wouldnt want to cut off a long-term friend like that thing is with this online friend we dont talk a lot either but we do keep in touch. We tried to make a compromise and eventually I gave in, I told her that I will stop talking to my friend completely but I dont have to remove her from my socials becasue I dont want to be rudeI do not want this to happen but that is a huge step back for me and I dont wish to be pushed further. But lately, she told me to unfollow her on some social medias, telling me that it will make her feel better and that she cant move forward if she stays there. This is kind of a last straw for me thats why I dont know what to do anymore. Please give me your honest and unbiased opinion on that. I would really appreciate it.",

    "text": "So my ex disappeared about a month after I had given him this ring, the ring he is wearing in the picture, end of August last year. We were together for the better part of two and a half years. I was also pregnant at the time. I miscarried, and still was trying to contact him. We were long distance, didnt have a proper visa for the country he lived in. Months of him not returning any texts then blocking me. I called him at the restaurant he was a working at. He told me he had met someone else and saw serious about them and saw a future with them. I heard from friends that lived in his town that he was moving to another country with her. That was back in December. Havent talked to him since. He messaged me yesterday with a photo of his left hand, wearing the ring that I gave him. No other context or acknowledgment. I sent him a gif that was an inside joke years ago in response. He hasnt texted me back or acknowledged anything. Ive thought of him a lot, still love him, but Im totally humiliated. Part of me would like a chance to speak to him and to just finally open up about everything that has happened. Im wondering if I should ask for that in a text or just leave it as it is. Are there any stories out there where people can work it out or just speak honestly after such a rupture ? Or is this just a test because maybe the other girl didnt work out?",

She invited me to live with her, but I struggled. I couldnt find work, didnt know the language, and became insecure, anxious, and unpredictable. I left suddenly. That was the end. We struggle on for a few more months but I was a mess without a support system. She was my first love. Afterward, I drifted ... drinking, smoking, unemployed. I used the last of my savings to travel through South America. I ended up broke and homeless. Eventually, I learned a new language, found work, and secured legal status. Im now married, but I still regret how things ended 20 years ago. I often think of her, especially in the past five years. She never spoke to me again - I dont blame her. I once sent a short apology through a platform she probably no longer uses. I even dream of her sometimes. I have hobbies, stay fit, selfreflect but it lingers. Anyone successfully beat their ghost/s?",

    "text": "Hey folks, Ive always struggled to track my daily spending. Ive tried the usual apps some great ones out there, but logging every coffee or cab ride manually just doesnt stick. Recently, I started working on a voice-first personal finance tool. The idea is super simple: You just speak your expense ...and the app logs it. No typing, no categories to scroll, no friction. The goal is to make it feel like talking to a friend something you can use while walking, commuting, or brushing your teeth. Its still very early, but heres what Im curious about: Would you use something like this? Whats your current habit for logging expenses if any? Is speaking to an app for finance stuff too weird, or does it feel natural? Im keeping the build lean for now and just trying to validate if theres real need for this kind of thing. Any feedback ideas, red flags, wild thoughts would mean a lot Happy to share a test version soon with anyone interested! Thanks,",

    "title": "How Do I Act As A 70-Year-Old Man Amongst Female Family Members That Hate The Patriarchy?",
    "text": "It happened gradually, but the rally against the patriarchy the belief that men control the world took hold when my niece, Jean, refused to accept any type of assistance from me, including an offer to open the door or take that third bag of groceries piled in her arms. What started as a recognition that, although egalitarian thinking among todays Western marriages is prevalent, there is a segment of the male population that believes women are second-class citizens, became a way to operate in her day-to-day life. Why do we have this chasm between men and women? There are any number of explanationsthat in caveman times, men hunted and women gathered that in the mid-twentieth century, men worked outside the home and women were homemakers and yet today, women still earn less money, are objectified, and somehow are pushed down by the patriarchy. Its not uncommon to hear some women retell stories of being propositioned during job interviews, whistled at, or treated differently at restaurants because women stereotypically tip less than men. I once heard a wealthy lady complain that she gets the less desirable tee times at the country club. Just consider movies and music, and youll be hard-pressed not to see and hear a heavy focus on womens beauty. To hear my niece Jeans worldview, and Im exaggerating to make a pointthat women were and are born into a society where they need to wear makeup, get their breasts enlarged, be thin, wear high heels, work as flight attendants or nurses, or waitresses, and have limited access to captains of industry and other leadership roles. In summary, my heterosexual niece Jen is pro-women in everything now. From having a majority of lesbian friends to reading a lot of feminist authors, accepting weight gain as a protest against societys pressure to have a slim physique, listening to mostly female musical artists, and so on. By the way, I am a liberal-thinking old man. But I pose the question to women: What are your thoughts on the patriarchy? Do you believe youve been pushed down by a world operated primarily by men?

Extreme enough that it happened almost everyday for many years , included public humiliation and violence outside, and sometimes even involved the cops. Anyway, I have to attribute my people-pleasing tendencies to this. I had to find love outside. I was limited in the choice of friends simply because of geography and availability. Had to be friends with who was there. Not to sound like Ive never the problem. I sure have been. I also have reflected enough to understand that while Ive tried being a good friend, I never received and continue not receiving reciprocation from people I value highly. Ever since I was a kid I have been overly helpful to friends, helping them pass school to now helping them out and championing for their success in their careers. However I constantly and quite judgmentally find myself at the receiving end of shallow and superficial gestures. Its honestly made me bitter and quite resentful. The sadness sometimes consumes me. I can intellectualise the problem but find it hard to break free from it.",

Now that Carl Andre is dead does this change the legality surrounding access to those records? Is it worth it to submit a FOIA request or other kind of public records request. Any advice is appreciated. Also, considering FOIA is getting bludgeoned by the Trump administration are there alternatives for going about accessing this kind of information? Location: NYC/VA",

    "text": "So long story short after buying my home few years back, i used lowes card to fix some issues after moving in which, was no big deal. But then this year our mortgage went up 400 a month up to 2500 a month. On top of that my fiances work has slowed down making it very hard to make the mortgage payments. I called loancare today, to see what options i have. My thoughts are if i could buy sometime, i could pay lowes and another card off which would make paying mortgage much easier. Or since im at 7.1 interest maybe doing a loan modification? They told me i have to fill out this paperwork Then they will give me my options. What are yalls experience with loancare? Thank you for any help or advice",

I just want advice on about distancing myself without making it obvious. I dont really talk with them but they come to me once in a while about themselves, theyre both conceited. One of them is a dry texter so Ill just reciprocate the same energy back the other one Im not so sure.",

I love her personality and we connect really well with each other. I am also very particular in the kind of qualities I want a partner to have, and she has almost all of them. It has been a long time since Ive met someone whose personality I love this much. However, after seeing her for this long, Ive realized that I dont find her as physically attractive as Ive found some of the girls I have dated in the past. Its not that I am not attracted to her, but Im not head over heels for how she looks either. Every time we meet Im constantly thinking that I am not as attracted to her as I would like to be attracted to someone Im dating. Were talking about getting serious about each other, and Im not sure if I should be dating her if Im questioning myself this much. How do I decide if I should commit to a relationship with her? Will physical attraction develop along the way? What if it doesnt?",

    "title": "Google Support has completely broken me Ive had 4 faulty Pixel replacements and zero real accountability",
    "text": "Hey everyone. I used AI to help me write this because Im honestly beyond exhausted. Ive been dealing with Google Support since September 2024 and its been one of the most frustrating, stressful customer service experiences of my life. I feel like Im shouting into the void and no one is truly listening. Heres whats been happening: --- 1. It started with a simple battery issue. In September 2024, I contacted Google Support because my original Pixel 8 bought from a third-party UK retailer had a battery problem. I expected a basic warranty replacement. Instead, I entered a nightmare. --- 2. Multiple faulty replacements followed. Google sent me several replacement Pixel 8 units at least three. I have really lost count like Im not joking, each one faulty in different ways: One had a none functioning fingerprint sensor One had a faulty double tap Another just randomly fails in daily usage None of them met basic working standards. I wasted months dealing with this. --- 3. Endless support loops and contradictions. Ive received over 100 emails from different support agents and teams, most of them contradicting each other. At one point, they said you can change colour so I said might as well then another guy said that they couldnt change the device color due to policy. Later, they did change itwithout acknowledging the contradiction. Ive been bounced between hardware support, refund teams, and higher-tier teams and no one has taken full ownership of the case. New cases have been opened while old ones were still active, creating even more chaos. --- 4. Failed escalations and ignored rights. They promised me a formal escalation with a 48-hour turnaround. That deadline passed with zero response. I mentioned the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, which they initially ignored. Only after repeated pressure did they begin to acknowledge any of it. --- 5. Finally offered an upgrade... but it came broken too. Eventually, they offered me a Pixel 8 Pro as a gesture of goodwill. I appreciated the gesture but it shouldnt have taken weeks of stress to get there. When the device arrived, it had a Circle to Search issue which I fixed myself. But that was just the beginning... --- 6. The Pixel 8 Pro is also severely faulty. The upgrade device now has serious performance problems: Constant lag The screen sometimes flickers like its having a seizure Typing is glitchy keypresses register, but dont appear Fingerprint sensor often doesnt respond --- 7. They told me to go to a repair shop. Instead of acknowledging that this is yet another faulty device, support told me to either send it in for repair or take it to a local repair shop. No immediate replacement. No apology. No accountability. This is my fourth faulty device. Im a student in a critical academic year, and I rely on my phone for school and professional work. Its unacceptable. --- 8. I begged for higher-level support and was rejected. When I asked to speak to the same higher-tier support team that had previously managed my case, I was refused. Only after two hours of pushing on the phone did they eventually transfer me and then that team just stopped responding entirely. Now Ive received a message from someone completely new, who clearly hasnt read the case history. --- Ive had enough. Google Support has broken me down over months. I dont want to fight anymore, but I also wont let this go silently. Im posting this here because I know I cant be the only one and frankly, people deserve to know whats going on behind the scenes. If anyone has advice or has been through something similar, please share.",

One of the question was asking student who they would choose as their VP if they ran for President. Fun question in theory, one of the featured responses was Will Ferrell, but thats not the one I take issue with. One of the featured student responses that was in the yearbook was: Donald Trump because we think alike. Is it legal for a public high school to have that in their yearbook?",

    "text": "Im a part time personal trainer almost by accident. I mostly started just giving workout plans and advise to a bunch of engineers on my team and now have a really cool little side gig going! But I wanted to just jump in here and share a few things Ive noticed while walking down a fitness journey with my people and the things I tell each one of my new clients feels weird calling them clients, as they seem to become more like friends immediately but neither here nor there. With that being said, here are 5 things I think every beginner should truly know/understand when getting into fitness: 1. You dont need the perfect plan, you just need to start. Theres so much noise out there, and its easy to feel like youre doing it wrong. But honestly, if youre showing up and doing something consistently, youre already ahead of where you were yesterday, and the you from yesterday is the only person you should be comparing yourself to. 2. nothing has to be extreme. Not your workouts, not your diet, nothing. Most of my beginner clients do 3 workouts a week, 3040 mins each, and get great results. No 5am bootcamps or cutting out everything you love. Just small, steady progress. 3. Track progress beyond the scale. The number on the scale matters, sure, but so do things like energy, mood, how your clothes fit, or even just feeling stronger walking up stairs. Those invisible wins are huge. 4. Youre going to screw up and thats okay. Youre gonna mess up your diet. Youll do exercises wrong. You might take supplements that turn out to be useless. Youll feel like you know nothing sometimes. But the truth is: everyone you see in great shape went through all of that. Theyve made more mistakes than you probably will, they just didnt quit. Give yourself grace. Your journey is yours. Just keep at it. 5. Ask for help. Be okay not knowing everything. Ask someone at the gym who looks confident what theyd recommend. Most people love being asked, and honestly, they probably dont see themselves the way you do. Your question might actually help them feel proud of how far theyve come. And one day, someones gonna ask you how you did it, and youll be shocked, because youll still feel like youre figuring it out. But that moment will remind you how far youve come. Anyways, just wanted to share. If youre starting out or trying to get back into it, feel free to drop a question. Im happy to help if I can.",

    "text": "I understand the triple tax savings everyone talks about with HSAs, but I feel like there is a gigantic asterisk that no acknowledges, or maybe I really dont understand! If Im paying a 30 income tax rate and I invest 1000 in an HSA I have saved 30 in taxes. If I use that money immediately for medical expenses I will have 1000 tax free for that purpose. Heres the asterisk. If I instead choose to pay my 1000 medical bill with money from savings that has already been taxed at my 30 rate, I am EFFECTIVELY spending 1428 for my 1000 medical expense. So HSAs are triple tax advantaged in an isolated sense, but if you have medical expenses you are sacrificing one of those tax advantages in another way by using post tax money instead. In the first scenario where I use my HSA to pay 1000, I would have freed up money from that tax savings that I could then invest in a Roth 300 post tax or 401k 428 pre-tax to capture the other 2/3rds of the triple tax savings. Using an HSA for medical locks in two tax savings immediately and then gives me the flexibility to use the saved dollars to shift my tax burden and decide how to best capture that 3rd tax savings growth.",

It is subjectively a really nice picture. He reacted to it with a love heart - I said do you love it? And was smiling. He responds you should take one when you wake up first thing in the morning and post that. My smile disappeared, I said what do you mean by that? Thats a really odd thing to say. He back-pedalled and said thats when you look cutest it obviously is not, I feel like he was trying to take me down a peg. Please someone hit the nail on the head and explain why this is an odd thing to say to me so I can explain to him why I am now feeling fairly OFF.",

Nahum from where i live Skopje, the capital so its safe to say that we wont be returning there in a while. While we where in the bus my friend asked if they could borrow it and because i was so tired from traveling all day i let him borrow it but told him to put it back in my bad when he is done. Fast forawrd and hour and when i ask him where is it not only has he given it to like 3 people who claim to have returned it, but he doesnt have it. We only have one hour left of the bus ride, and i dont know if i should ask for money or let it go? For refrence the item is worth 10 euros, which isnt the most but i paid with my money and i was in the process of saving up for a computer, so those 10 euros kind of hurt me. It was also a really nice one",

    "text": "Id advise reading it all but if you dont want to. TLDR: met a girl we hit it off. Ive been talking for two months but now when it came time to meet her things seem like they are changing. This might be a really long post, but I want to provide as much detail as I can. I am 21 years old and I am south Asian she recently turned 21 and his white British. I started talking to her about two months ago and we met online somewhere and we instantly hit it off. We got along so well and I was attracted to her personality and to her. more than the her other features. She is perfect as a person shes kind shes caring shes family oriented she takes care of her mum her dad and her sister. She is Christian but doesnt mind learning about my religion. I did speak to her about religion and she said that she didnt mind and she did like my religion and wouldnt mind converting as long as she knew more about it which I really liked. Shes open to learn new things which I like about her. She told her family about me she told her friends about me and she told her grandparents too and Im joking he said that I cant leave now because her family knew her past relationship wasnt so great and happened at least Id say a year ago and ever since then shes been single. This is mature and drives and what not I dont think I like about her is that she does not beep or smoke and she has stopped drinking as well but recently I have noticed that she disappears for hours and then comes back later on sometimes she doesnt even come back the same day she then text me the following morning saying that oh yeah, her phone was off or something or that her phone wasnt charged or she was doing something talking to her friend just anything really and I cant really say anything because they are reasons not excuses. They sound more like reason. She has agreed to meet me this weekend, but still it seems like she hasnt really confirmed it and at first we agreed to like meet at her place, but then it changed to a hotel and I asked her why and she said that because she wouldnt like it if her family argued or made fun of her in front of me and I said okay. I asked my sister and my aunt for advice and both of them said that she is giving off weird vibes and shes moving on serious and that theres no point wasting your time and money going to see her. I told him that I mean its the only girl that pretty much has given me some sort of love and attention in the past I dont know how many years And that I have made plans to see her this Saturday and I dont want them plans to be cancelled. I have blocked her and removed her twice before and both times she did reach out to me and texted me asking why I blocked her. I told her that it seems like she isnt really serious and I feel like Im just being laid on and shes like no, she isnt always on her phone also she can just not have a life I just need some advice on what I should do. Should I carry on talking to her? Should I meet her and then see what the vibe is?",

    "text": "Im a 29-year-old woman, and my boyfriend 30M and I have been together for five years. I really do love him, but Im getting tired of always having to ask him to take me out on a date. He always says hes tired, which I understand hes been dealing with an illness and has struggled mentally for a while. Our relationship hasnt been at its best over the past few months. We also do 50/50 majority of the time. We dont really do much together. Most of our time is spent at his parents house. We sometimes order takeaway and eat it in his room, then watch a movie there as well. He also spends a lot of time on his phone or computer. This is something weve discussed a few times already. Every time I ask if we can go out and do something, he always says: I hope you can understand. Im new to this job, I need time to adjust, and Im pretty tired most of the time. Or hell say: Im working hard so I can buy a property so we wont fall behind. Im getting tired of hearing these same phrases over and over. It feels like our lives are on pause just because he started a new job or is saving for a property. Ive started to feel like I dont even want to go see him anymore because I feel like Ill be wasting my time doing nothing. Im the type of person who enjoys doing things and wants to feel fulfilled at the end of the day. It doesnt have to cost anything even a walk or a simple picnic would do but hes too tired for that too. This situation is also affecting my mental health. Ive started to feel depressed again isolated and lonely. Now, Im beginning to not enjoy spending time with him, because its been the same for the past few years. And also because of my mental health. However, he always assures me that he wants to be with me, and thats why hes working so hard for our future. I really do love and care about him. Any advice how to approach this kind of situation?",
