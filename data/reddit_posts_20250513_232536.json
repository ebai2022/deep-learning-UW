I let it slide until I found him following random only fans girls, adult actresses content, adding back old female classmates from his school, and when I confronted him, he is giving excuses like that he added, followed them by mistake. My problem is not that he followed or added these females/girls, fictional or real but expecting me to let it slide without overreacting or calling him out or not feeling insecure.

Unless, its 4am once a week maybe and he ONLY likes it from behind for about 2 min at this point, cums, then goes back to sleep. And Wants the lights on so he, can see my butthole. I really need intimacy, and the bond that it brings.. its just so hard to feel that bond when I feel like he doesnt care about getting me off.. not that I care about actually getting off, but I have never been with someone so selfish. I got on top, rode him until I came, and as soon as I did, I lifted off of him and his penis was flacid. It fell out of me. He immediately then asked if I could suck him off and let him cum on my face. I was so angry. I said no, then just got up and put my clothes on. Hes not interested in my lady part, at all. Ever. We have such a good relationship other than that .. but it is seeming to be a bigger need than I ever thought it was. Its almost like hes grossed out by it. I am used to men loving the smell, getting turned on by how wet I am, and wanting to please me as much as I want to please them. The way he acts makes me not want to please him anymore. I dont know what to do. Is this something that Im wrong for being upset over?",

    "title": "I, F26, just saw my ex, M27, posted that I owe him my blood",
    "text": "My ex, 2 years ago, wanted me to come out for my birthday. I really didnt want to because I was gearing up to break up with him but never had the balls sit him down because it seemed like everyday was a bad day for him. The year previously, my sister died and he yelled at me 3 weeks after her death. Our first ever argument. He made me cry and never apologized. I expressed to him I didnt want to go, I really couldnt because of my job, and that I didnt have the money for it. We talked about this a lot and asked him not to plan anything for my birthday, nobody celebrates it anyway, I just wanna be left alone so I could wallow in my self pity. He saw that a band he liked but I hated was playing in his city. He bought the tickets, got a hotel, and bought a plane ticket and emailed it to me while I was working and told me to figure it out, he wants to see me. I told him I really didnt want to do this, but he said thats it, end of conversation, Im either coming or hes coming up here to get me. I told him to please put a trip protection thing on it, I cant make any promises. This was in March. My birthday is September. Previously, that thanksgiving, I asked him not to propose to me. I needed self reflection and introspection before making that decision and I honestly was trying to gain the courage to break up with him. Again, it seemed like everyday was a bad day to bring it up. Thats an excuse I used at least, I know now I was just being a bitch. Thanksgiving comes, and he proposes to me in my dead sisters bedroom. Seeing the ring 50 ring from Amazon - matters made me sick. I didnt say yes, but I didnt say no. What was I going to do? Say no in front of my family? Embarrassing him? Then sleep beside him? Then drive him home 9 hours? No thanks. Then tried to sleep with me in her bed. Honestly, I lost my respect for him then and never could gain it back. I shouldve voiced that. Back to the point, its July now and we finally break up. I was sad, sure, but this is something truly needed since I have been checked out mentally, romantically, sexually, emotionally, and even physically. He says that I owe him the plane tickets and hotel. I asked him why cant he get the trip protection for canceling? Its July. He also said that the engagement ring costs a lot and would like it back. He also threatened to fly up here with a gun, throwing the ring in the river and shoot me and then himself. I told him thats fucking stupid, you cant come up here with a gun on a plane, and Ill just mail you the ring back, I didnt want it anyway. Whatever, I dont care. He shit talked my dead sister in the same phone call, that was the last I heard from him. So our break up hits my family, I become homeless willingly because I was in the bad home in the first place. I found a jewelry store to get the ring cleaned and the guy behind the counter shows me the exact same ring that was 50 and asks me if I have proof of purchase just to see if I had free ring cleanings. I dont care for the price, but he went on and on about how expensive it was. I took it off and put it in my car door. Now either I didnt actually do that or someone stole it, I dont know. I just know when I went to UPS to mail it back, it was gone. At this point, hes blocked me on EVERYTHING. Phone, Facebook, twitter, email, snap, insta, tumblr, if he could block me in dreams he did that too. Its been 2 years. Therapist cleared me from a personality disorder last month. Got married to someone else fairly quickly medical insurance reasons, very serious medical issue but Im pretty happy about it even if we ultimately dont work out, just want him to get medical attention and not go in debt. The thing he said about my sister hurts in way I cant describe. Im not reaching out to ask him for anything. That was appalling. My ex posts that I owe him money and the only way I can pay him back is in blood, I deserve even worse things happening to me, and that hes looking for my address. Listen. I feel like Im going crazy. I told him not to do that, he still did, I am wrong for losing the ring. I know that. But owe him in blood? For a band I hate? For a trip I told him I didnt want to take? So listen. I want to make things right so bad. I really do. From medical expenses, losing my job, to car troubles, I really havent been able to keep my bank account afloat. But do I even go out of my way to reward this kind of behavior? Do I let him take me to me to court?",

There are two houses on the lot which my uncle is the actual owner of. He lives in one I rent the other. I will be paying a large outstanding property tax bill making this all happen. By in the process of having this swap done, I mean we are still shopping for a real estate lawyer for other issues with the property. Besides the name swap, we are looking to combine a 2nd connecting empty lot which is also owned by my uncle into one lot. Both lots have been paid off for a long time and have no mortgage. There is also an issue where the property tax is stating there are 3 house on this lot instead of 2. There used to be 3 but it was torn down a long time ago. So, we are in the process of looking for a real estate lawyer that deals with these sorts of things. Its seems most just do closings estate planning. Is this the correct lawyer to be looking for? Is there any implications to my name being put on the deed, positive or negative? The other siblings that are on this deed have not paid anything into the property or have paid taxes/bills on it. I am just curious if I would be hit with some tax bill going forward or the like for my name being on it.",

    "text": "I looked back at all of my paystubs today. 2020 I started my job making 55k/y Today I make 85k/y and I am getting 200 more per paycheck than I did at 55k. My insurance has quadrupled, I pay so much in taxes and pay 5 the end of the year. Which is my goal, but Im paying so much. I get around 1600 total taken out per paycheck including everything. I had to cut my 401k contributions because I had to pay for college. At the end of the day, I am making around 4,000 a month. In those 5 years my rent has tripled. I live way out in the suburbs too, with room mates. I drive my 2013 Prius which is a godsend. I also now have my bachelors degree as of a couple months ago but like, what is next??? Get a job paying 100k and make an extra 300 a month when I will be paying 500/m on student loans soon? It just feels like Ive made it, but then I keep getting dragged down. Ive always been an inch away from owning a house since 2012. At this point I give up completely. It feels frustrating. On top of this with my insurance prices being quadruple my insurance no longer covers my therapy, physical therapy, or medication. So I had to prioritize my medication. It would be 1200/m if I did all 3. My endometriosis medication alone is 300/m. Im grateful for having a house over my head and food in my fridge every day. Just seeing my paystubs sent me into a spiral. Im sorry for venting. Thank you for listening.",

In the beginning I lied and told him I was 21 but Im actually 19. Hes 24. I feel horrible about lying and I honestly dont know why I did, I just didnt know Id end up feeling this way about him. Idk how to bring this up or even tell him that Ive been lying. However hes not the type to even ask questions or anything so our ages have never been brought up since the very beginning. Its only a 2 year difference but 19 is different than 21. I havent lied about anything else. Literally everything else he knows about me is the truth except for my age. I just feel really guilty and Im afraid Im going to lose him.",
