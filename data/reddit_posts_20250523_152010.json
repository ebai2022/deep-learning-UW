    "title": "PhD intern being trained on my job 3 weeks after I was hired software engineering",
    "text": "For context I worked for this company as an intern for a year before being promoted last month to a probationary software engineer position. 1 week later, I get a message from my boss that he will be taking me off all upcoming projects and having a summer intern do those. At the time he had been doing intern interviews for the annual summer internship program, and came across a CS PhD student with 2 years experience on our exact tech stack, so he decided he was going to start giving all my work to him instead. I was informed that I would be working on a legacy web app under a different manager for the next 2 months. When I asked this other manager what was going on, he basically said my boss approached him asking him if I could work under him instead for 2 months and he could find something else for me to work on. This is while that PhD intern is doing all of my upcoming projects and features, being trained on my job. In the PhD interns first week, he was able to knock out a ticket that would have easily taken me 4-5 days in 1 day. When I reached out to my boss to see when I would be switching back to working on the web apps, he could not give a clear timeline other than the legacy web app would take about 2 months. So far my boss has been unable to provide any logical answer on why I have been taken off all my work, other than him saying I was selected to work under the different manager and legacy web app for 2 months because I was doing so well. Which doesnt make any sense to me. There is also a backlog of over 100 tickets and he isnt assigning me any of them and unassigned me from all upcoming tickets, telling me this legacy app is the only priority for me now other manager has subtly mentioned its not a huge priority. I am not sure if he was stringing me along and never intended to actually hire me and now is going to replace me with someone now that he has another intern, or if there is buyers remorse where he met the PhD student shortly after hiring me and wants him now instead. But I am spiraling and very depressed. I do not feel able to job search right now at all and I am barely making it through the day. Any suggestions on how to deal with this would be appreciated. I have a monthly 1:1 check in with my boss on Tuesday.",

I am cautious around pedestrians as I do not want to hurt anybody, but on the streets I am lane splitting and speeding. I want to post videos of myself doing this because I know there would be people that would find it interesting, but I think there will be people in the local personal electric vehicle community who will know that its me and may want to report me to the police, because they dont like the bad PR I would be giving them. Obviously I would never show my face in these videos, but Im wondering what lengths I would realistically have to go to in order to protect myself from persecution. For example, if my gear and scooter matches what is seen in the video, is that enough to get me in trouble?",

Ive also made mistakes, but lately, every time she does something wrong, she avoids taking responsibility. According to her, she never does anything wrong, and she says I exaggerate everything. But many times, Im just trying to talk, and for example, she responds rudely. When I ask whats going on, she acts like she didnt do anything. Then, when I try to understand the situation, she decides she doesnt want to talk anymore and asks for space. This has been going on for over 3 or 4 months with the same pattern: first, she pretends nothing happened, then she blames me for overreacting, insults me or mocks me sarcastically, and then blames me for reacting badly to how she treats me. After that, she doesnt want to talk and asks for spacebut its just so she doesnt have to take responsibility. In the end, she always changes the subject, and I end up apologizing for something I often didnt even do. In some of these situations, shes even broken up with methis has happened 3 or 4 timesand its always because she refuses to acknowledge her bad behavior. Ive asked her many times to talk about it and to reflect on how she treats me, but she always has an explanation that justifies everything she does. She anticipates what Ill say so she can defend herself and claim shes not justifying anything or minimizing my feelingsbut she always ends up doing it, and nothing ever changes. The most recent situation happened just yesterday. Actually, it started the night before, when she once again decided not to talk to me over something I didnt even do. According to her, I was insisting that she spoke to me in a bad tone while we were on a callbut in reality, I just asked why she was speaking that way. Just because I asked, she suddenly didnt feel like watching a movie with me anymore. I stayed silent, and then she decided to hang up and stop talking to me. When I asked her why she did that, she said she needed space because I was too irritating and always looked for reasons to fight. I calmly tried to explain that I wasnt trying to start a fightjust that it was a simple misunderstanding that she was blowing out of proportion. But then the same pattern repeated, like always. The next day, I tried to talk to her calmly and told her I understood that maybe I can be a little insistent sometimes, and that Id work on that. But again, she justified everything by saying I was annoying, that I pick fights over small things, and exaggerate everything. She said I insist so much and annoy her so much that the only solution is to ignore me. I tried to understand and gave her the space she asked for. Later that afternoon, we talked again, and everything seemed fineuntil she misinterpreted a message. I swear I meant it kindly. I just told her she shouldnt take a certain medication because it was bad for her. She replied that it wasnt bad and made a face she always makes when shes annoyed. I asked why she made that face, since I wasnt trying to offend her. She said it was nothing and that she took the pills because she didnt have any othersbut I hadnt asked about that. It seemed like she misunderstood everything. I just wanted to know if something was wrong because of her reaction. I told her that I only asked because of the face she made. Not even a second after explaining that, she decidedagainthat she didnt want to talk to me anymore. I asked her to please understand that I wasnt trying to fight and that she was twisting things again, but she said I was exaggerating and just looking for a reason to argue. She said I was being too pushy, even though I wasnt doing any of the things she said bothered her that morning. Still, she called me annoying, ridiculous, overwhelmingand then blocked me. I told her that her behavior was really hurtful, and she just replied that she never wanted to talk to me again and that I should never contact her again. She kept calling me ridiculous. I told her Id leave her alone and that I hope she reflects on her behavior, and that I wouldnt message her again until she takes responsibility for it. Sometimes I think her friends are influencing her, giving her toxic advice to always be selfish and never self-reflect. Other times, I wonder if she likes someone else and is just trying to justify breaking up. I even think maybe shes already seeing or talking to someone else and thats why she avoids me. Or maybe she simply doesnt like me anymore but is afraid of being aloneor of losing the benefits of having a relationship. Honestly, I dont know what to do anymore. I truly love her, but she doesnt want to change. Lately, I feel like I cant say anything or feel upset about anything she does because I know shell act the same way again. Im extremely stressed and heartbroken over this. Our relationship has been very intense, and I really thought she was the love of my life. I wouldnt leave her over things she could change to make things betterbut she just never wants to change. Please give me advicehow can I help her change? Or do you think this cant be fixed anymore?",

I was taken by a smooth talker, convincing documents presented me, and a deal that seemed reasonable. It all blew up when I went to register/insure our new to us van. Altered odometer, altered title, fake service records. Seller signing Release signature in wrong areas on Title to stall process. Police/DMV Fraud Unit say it is a civil matter unless I have information for contacting him. His cell phone was a Ghost phone, I met him at his work place and I gave him cash. I tried to donate the van but they wont accept it with out a clean title. I want to avoid registering it in my name and having to pay sales taxes/fees. DMV has a process for getting a new title issued but proof of sending a registered letter to seller and then a 45 day wait period is required. I just want to end this mistake and move on. I was thinking of abandoning the van in a parking lot and letting it get towed and be done with it. Thanks for your time, I appreciate any suggestions.",

On the road-side we saw two lazy-looking fellows, in long great coats and bundles in their hands, going into a cottage. What do you deal in? said I, to one of them, who had not yet entered the house. In the medical way, said he. And, I find, that vagabonds of this description are seen all over the country with tea-licences in their pockets. They vend tea, drugs, and religious tracts. The first to bring the body into a debilitated state the second to finish the corporeal part of the business and the third to prepare the spirit for its separation from the clay! Never was a system so well calculated as the present to degrade, debase, and enslave a people! Law, and, as if that were not sufficient, enormous subscriptions are made everything that can be done is done to favour these perambulatory imposters in their depredations on the ignorant.",

    "text": "Location: Atlanta, Georgia. I started a comedy club in 2009 called Laughing Skull Lounge inside a back room of a restaurant called The Vortex. My agreement w the original Vortex owners legally expired in 2012 and I have been a tenant at will since. The Vortex also owns the IP of Laughing Skull Lounge. Well, the Vortex got new owners in 2023 and they have recently given me notice to vacate as they are going to keep doing comedy in their back room. They are not compensating me anything and just having me leave. I thought that by itself was Unjust Enrichment. Now I found out that they are hiring my staff that I built. This totally seems like Unjust Enrichment: One party confers a benefit on another The recipient has knowledge of the benefit The recipient accepts or retains the benefit under circumstances where it would be inequitable to do so without compensating the provider. Do I have a case here? Please ask me any clarifying questions. Thanks in advance",

    "title": "Is my girlfriend 20F lying to me 19M? or am i being paranoid",
    "text": "I 19M have been on a relationship with my current girlfriend 20F for a few months now. This is my first relationship ever, while it is not her first i am her fourth. When we started dating, we made sure to set boundaries and expectations towards each other. She was the one that proposed we should be fully honest about our past and how we should communicate very thoroughly so that there is no misunderstanding between us. Well i took it to heart, i tell her EVERYTHING about my past despite never actually having any actual relationships nor hookups, things along the lines of my sexual activitywhich is just masturbatingor my close encounters with previous women where i chickened out, and one occasion where i was sexually harassed by someone. im basically celibate but i feel that telling her everythingespecially the Sexual harrassment partwould be beneficial for our trust in the long run. She seemingly also does the same, she tells me about her previous relationships, even uncomfortable things such as one of her exes SAing her which is a tough thing for her to talk about and i really appreciate her being vulnerable with me. When i asked her about her previous sex life, she said that she never had sex with her exes, she claims that she has only ever made out with them this will be important later. Fast fowards a few months into the relationship, i sort of catch her saying something that she would only know if she had ever been sexual with someone, when i confronted her about it, she said I thought i told you? what did you think i meant when i said ive made out before? I thought this to be quite strange, because in my mind making out with someone is when you passionately kiss with them sometimes with hickeys and nothing else. I went the extra effort to google it, ask chatgpt, and even three of her friends on what they think making out means and everyone seems to agree with kissing passionately as a benchmark. Before i pointed any fingers towards her, i went and made sure to confirm what she meant by making out, so i asked her via chat: Me : When you say make-out, what are you exactly referring to? Kissing passionately? Sex? Gf : not exactly sex, more like foreplay. No contact between genatalia. Me : Clothed? Gf : No This was quite shocking to me, not only did she do more than just kissing passionately, they were naked, they were jerking each other off, and orgasm was involved because of the thing she said when i caught her. Before i had the chance to say anything, she immediately asked if i was mad and then tried to clarify by saying : Part of the reason why I didnt tell you is because : 1. I actually thought you understood what i meant when i said make-out 2. I didnt want to remember it because ya my ex did Sexually harassed me Im sorry if it made u upset, maybe the correct term is hooking up To make it clear, i am in no way mad at her for what she did, but i am pretty sure the term make-out has a pretty clear definition and i feel like she was trying to hide the fact that she had a sexual encounter with someone by masking it as making out. I feel sort of lied to and it feels hypocritical, i mean she made it quite clear early in our relationship regarding honesty and communication and i abide by that, putting all of my cards for her to see at the very beginning so that she knows what shes working with and yet here i am discovering something big about her past by catching her slipping up. What if i never catch her? is she just gonna keep it under the rug forever? I immediately tried communicating her regarding it. She said sorry and promised that it will never happen again which i appreciate, but what irks me is that she stresses that it was unintentional and that she never meant it like that, she blames it on her confusing the term making out which i dont know how to feel about. Me : I think the word make-out has a pretty clear definition, Which is kissing passionately, i even asked a few people to confirm just incase i was wrong Gf : Sorry Me : replying to the text about her reason for not telling me I am aware and respect that, but I think its quite dishonest to call it just making out Gf : I know Gf : I realize that Gf : Im sorry Me : I have been open with you regarding the harassment I had with REDACTED, and my close call with REDACTED knowing full well it would piss you off or make the conversation awkward. I would hope that we would be on an even playing field regarding that Gf : Yes Gf : I will be more open moving forward Gf : I apologize for not clarifying it Gf : Im sorry i made you feel like i was being dishonest. Honestly thats my bad, i misunderstood the meaning of make-out. I hope you can forgive me Gf : I realize now that my actions and words have hurt you. It was truly unintentional and i never meant for it to be like this. And i know now that i should have not assumed that you know things regarding relationships. Ill be clear moving forward so my question would be, is it even remotely possible to confuse the term making out? is this truly unintentional? or does making-out can actually mean more than just kissing passionately? did i say the wrong thing? am i being a bad partner????",

    "text": "Hi everyone, over the past few years my husband and I had some financial issues due to some health problems. We had several late payments and my husband has a credit card with Sunmark credit union and he was late over 120. He was contacted last June by their member resolution Specialist that he needs to make a 500 so his card doesnt get charged off, which he did. Again in September the same person contacted him to make a settlement of 8900 for a credit card balance of 10500. She said that if he doesnt agree to the settlement and doesnt make a payment ij 2 days the card will be charged off. He agreed on the settlement and she said they dont provide documents for it. He has been making regular payments ever since. A few months ago he got a call from the bank saying he needs to make a payment and they were unaware of any settlement. He went to the bank and they were also unaware and told him he needs to follow up with her. She is an employee of the bank we checked. A few days ago she called my husband and told him that his card willbe charged off if he doesnt pay the full 10,500, even if he follows through with the settlement. She offered re-age of the card which I dont fully understand what it is. We checked his credit and she is still reporting his card to the credit bureau as late payment every month. He emailed her today and she said we dont have an agreement but we agreed to monthly payments for 2 years and the card will be reported as late payment each month up until the last payment in August 2026 when the charged will be charged off for the remaining balance. All this is fishy to me and we told her to speak with her supervisor. She said they will be contacting my husband on Tuesday. The payments go towards the card, we checked. However we are charged late payment fee each month for some reason. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How can we proceed in this situation?",

    "text": "Yes, to be honest I dont know what to do anymore but, she is pregnant and I dont have a job and havent had one sense 2023 November. My job let me go because of a police report she made about a argument we had and didnt let me know about it until I was pulled over. I think my job wanted to let me know what was going on but it wasnt up to them to show me my warrant they just let me go from the job. I ended up losing all the confidence I had and when February of 2024 came to my surprise I had a warrant and I court date for domestic violence. Sat in jail for one night and my gf claims she didnt call the cops on me so it isnt her fault. But you made a police report and pressed charges on me. Foolishly still decided to be with her even while I had court because at this point I dont even have anyone that I trust to call a friend of family. I originally ran away from my mom, who before I was 21 ruined my credit before I even went to college, so by then I couldnt get a house or buy a car or finish school. So I decided to leave and be with my girlfriend. Bad decision on top of bad decision. Tbh, she wants leverage and that is what she has but God forbid that she has my child and has already try to ruin my life. As far as patience we have fought continuously and make up but nothing can ever take back the damaging and life changing experience of staying home day in and day out and not being able to support myself as the man that I am. She is pregnant today, but I deep down have resentment in trusting her and want her to have a abortion. Even though she is already pregnant I think the best thing is to let her abort it and just leave her alone entirely. So far, I have high blood pressure and have been to the hospital twice because of how depressed or stressed out that of the situation. My whole life, I have been put in a box by my mother which made this void to find the proper love from a spouse but the funny thing about life is that everyone has problems. But I am so mixed, its like a situation that is crafted for bi-polar and depression",
