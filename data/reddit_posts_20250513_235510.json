    "text": "Hey, everyone! My research pondered the question of which languages will be useful for students to learn in 2025 and switching careers. Based on the past trends, developer surveys, and also those community discussions, here are the five languages I feel will be worth the focus in 2025: Python Beginner-friendly, used for AI, ML, data analysis, and automation. JavaScript Still a vital language for web development front-end full-stack. Java Time-tested, still in most enterprise apps and Android apps. C Gives a solid foundation teaches really how computers work. C For system-level programming, games, and performance-critical applications. The languages present the opportunity in order to balance demand, support from the developer community, and upward scope. I want to hear what you people think Are there any languages youd swap in or out? Whats working for you lately? I wrote a short blog putting this down more visually if anyone wants to have a look at it. https://tccicomputercoaching.com/top-5-programming-languages-for-2025/https://tccicomputercoaching.com/top-5-programming-languages-for-2025/ Thank you happy coding!",

Just recently weve rekindled our romantic relationship and Ive really been enjoying it! Weve been on quite a few dates now and spend a lot of time together. Just recently before I asked him to make it official he kept referring to me as his girlfriend to his friends. He told me that he would like it if we were to get back together so I just asked him myself. He said yes, but now I feel guilty. I had a plan to talk to him about things that bothered me when we were previously together but that all went out the window cause I just asked him out of nowhere. I feel like I asked him too soon and should have talked about stuff before we got back together. I dont really know why I asked him I think it was just a spur of the moment type thing. But now im nervous to talk to him because im afraid hes just going to react the same way he did last time and I dont really know what to do. How do I go about this?",

    "text": "Honestly this isnt a serious problem but I feel like there arent many solutions and I dont want her to feel this way all the time When my gf and I are in FT, sometimes ill get a call from a friend or family member. Depending on who it is, ill either hang up our call bc ik itll be a long call or ill answer while were on the phone bc itll just be a quick question If i do answer while were on the phone, I mute myself so she gf cant hear my background since im sure its annoying to hear a conversation that not yours. Well when I end my conversation, I have a tendency to just unmute and not announce that im back/off my call. This is the pet peeve She hates that I just unmute myself and go back like nothing happened. She feels as though she has to play a guessing game of when Im off the phone vs when im not. The same goes for when I have to use the bathroom, or i go to the kitchen for a quick second. She would rather me make an announcement or say hi, im back. From my perspective, I feel like if she can see that I was gone and I came back, why do I need to announce it? Were on FT, like she can physically see when Im gone and when im not?? I assume I use the same logic when I get a phone call, like she can see when im talking to my phone vs when im not. So how do I get over this mindset to ease this pet peeve she has? I dont wanna bring up things that she does that are pet peeves of mine bc i dont wanna go tit-for-tat. TBH it should be really easy for me to just say hi, im back, but I cant get over the fact that she can physically see what im doing and when im doing it :/ This is also my first WLW relationship, so I feel like I have to tip-toe a lot compared to my past relationship with guys where I was just very upfront, petty, and confrontational. I feel like the answer is simple but its so hard to get outta my old ways TLDR My girlfriend has a pet peeve of me just unmuting myself without announcing that im back after I take a phone call bc she has to play a guessing game of if im still on the phone or not. How do i ease her mind so its not a big deal to either of us?",
