    "text": "Hi everybody this is my first time posting. My ex and I broke up about 5 days ago. We are currently doing no contact but have plans to meet next Sunday to discuss things. In my mind this is the closure conversation. We ended on fairly good terms and I do obviously still care about him but a few months ago we went on a trip in which I paid for his plane ticket with the promise he would pay me back when he could. While we were still together I told him not to worry about it until he was sure he could pay me without threatening his own financial standing. It has been a while since the topic of him paying me back has even been brought up and I dont know if he remembers. This is a substantial amount of money for me and I do need it back but I dont want to pressure him into paying it back immediately because I know hes not in a place he could do it. How do I bring it up without sounding mean or harsh? Should I wait a few weeks so it doesnt seem like thats the only thing Im concerned about? I also want to continue no contact after our conversation because I think its the right choice for me and dont want this to be some sort of connection with him. I guess I just need to know how to gently remind him of his promise so that he will pay me back at some point and not just leave it since we broke up.",

I have saving enough to take without loan but I want to keep it available for other purposes. I am in late 40s.. We are planning for joint loan or on wifes name. Which factors should I keep in mind? Is it a good idea to get maximum available loan ie 1cr or just 60l? How to decide the optimum amount considering the risk and peace of mind? Which bank is good among sbi, bank of baroda or Hdfc? Should I look for overdraft loans. Not sure if this is overthinking on this part. Thanks in advance.",
