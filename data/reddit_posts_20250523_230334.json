    "title": "My 35M wife 32F is soaring high at work and forgetting her values. How to make her reconnect to our shared values of being grounded and humble?",
    "text": "Around 6 months ago my wife got a big promotion at work and got a nice pay increase increase in responsibilities. I am happy for her and I know she deserves it. However as the months have gone on shes been pouring herself more and more into work. It started as having to grab an email here and there but its grown into working long hours and physically being in the house but always her mind is on work. Additionally, we have two young kids so I pick up more slack than she does w/ the kids but its totally fine my job is a regular 8-5. This week she went to a big time work conference and nailed it. She got deals done and was celebrated by her company, and in the evenings she stayed out til 1-3am doing the normal dinner/drinks/etc. that conferences have. During the conference I got 1x call for 3 minutes and a handful of texts spread throughout the day. Also during it Im taking care of the kids alone, it was a long week. She came home and I was hoping to hear she was home sick or terribly missed the kids while she was gone but instead its all conference and work talk. I didnt like that. Additionally, she said shes more fired up at work now than ever and is talking about working out, dressing nicer, losing weight, etc. She also mentioned she got a lot of male attention there, which is fine, but said she obviously didnt do anything with it but said she felt on top of the world. Lately, both my parents and hers have been coming over to help with childcare, and they have noticed. Theyve shared their honest concerns with me that theres a line thats being crossed here. For a married woman and mother, staying out late, chasing male attention, and openly seeking validation outside the family is inappropriate. It skirts dangerously close to behaviors that threaten trust and loyalty. Ok, their opinions are their business but not if they resonate with mine. Ive been feeling like this for some time now. One night at dinner, my wifes mom pulled her aside privately to share these concerns. My wife seemed surprised and later brought it up with me, probably expecting me to defend her or disagree. Instead, I told her I agreed. Success and ambition are fine, but the way shes leaning into this lifestyle the fact shes relishing male attention and external validation feels off. Her confidence comes from within and from those who genuinely love and support her, not from fleeting approval from strangers. I want her to stay grounded and humble, and truly make her realise her role here at home. I feel like shes thinking shes soaring high, but it can lead to damage if not checked. Our kids deserve a mother who leads by example not just in career success but in character. Im worried and shared this with her. I reminded her that the our family needs a steady hand, not someone caught up in the thrill of being on top of the world. Something she had voiced earlier she felt after a good day at work Any advice on bringing her back to reality and keep her connected to what really matters would be appreciated. Right now she cant see past her own self and shes been less than nice with me.",

    "title": "My long distance boyfriend has been cheating on me",
    "text": "So i met him in hinge last year. We were in contact and never talked much. We matched and it was just a casual conversation. He planned a date but i couldnt make it that day. So i shifted from the place where i was staying as i was in same city as his, and i went back home. After i went back home, we started talking and texting frequently. Our vibe matched over text and everything was so perfect. So as i was already single since a long time, we both decided to meet, and i booked a flight ticket back to his place, and he was waiting for me at the airport. He picked me up and everything was so dreamy. He was tall handsome and hot just as i expected. We started living together since then. Our vibe and energy matched so quickly and we fell for each other. He also started showing too much love and affection for me, everything was mutual. But i fell for him too soon, and i did not bother to check his red flags. He always portrayed himself as a very career and gym oriented person, who doesnt fuck around girls and people. I never even checked his phone. I literally went blind through all the red flags. So he said he has to go to his familys marriage event, so he told me to go back home. I went back home and we were still in relationship. I used to call him and his calls always went to voicemail. Very rarely he used to call me by himself and talk to me. He used to always say he much he misses me, how much he craves for me. I was so blind i was swept away with it. As i was already missing him, he was asking me to wait to come back to him as he has to shift a room. After he shifted, he himself booked a flight ticket for me to come to him. I just dont get it, he has made me believe in every way that he loves me. After i came, he decorated the room and surprised me, and i genuinely did not doubt his actions. His roommate was a female, and he always used to talk about her. But i met her, she is a genuinely nice person, and as a girly intuition she is not the harm for me. After coming here, i realised I am getting too serious for him, and him on the other side just was fulfilling his desires and needs. I do have desires and needs, i am not denying it, but i genuinely loved him, and he also showed he loved me through his actions which never made me doubt him. So i made good friendship with the female friend who has her room beside his room, and it was going well. One day i confessed my boyfriend and told him to want future with him. He said he wanted too, but as it was a totally impossible thing he said his parents wont agree and he cant go against his parents. He has been saying this since Day 1 but he was also not letting me go at the same time. He was giving me hopes of love and marriage. So whenever i talk about this, he just tries to change the topic, distract it by playing a victim card. He says his father would kill him, and he has to marry the girl selected by his family. So i was sad about it and i was crying regarding this to that female roommate. She told me he has been bringing a girl called X from his office, and has been going on dates with her. He has been in a physical relationship with her and he recently went on a trip with his friend gang where X is also part of. He was on call with me whole time so i didnt get any doubt. He had sex with X girl that day after cutting my call. She revealed all the truths about me and how much in a delusion i was about this guy. She made me realise men are disgusting and all they care about is their physical needs and desires. He literally booked a ticket for me back to his place from my home even after doing all this behind my back. He has been fucking her all behind my back. He was the most loving person in my mind previously , but now just the thought of him disgusts me. Just the thought of him fucking another girl disgusts me. I literally hate that i wasted my time on such a pest who doesnt even deserve it. If he seriously is getting sex here then why did he even call me back from my home? I sacrificed my parents, my dog only for him to cheat me? I hate men. Thanks for the life lesson. Pls tell me what to do and how to make him confess and make him regret coz Iam not gonna let this slide so easily.",

I kind of went crazy and started overthinking as the location went off right next to a strip club. I kept texting him and calling, he got upset at me for not trusting him, I explained what it was like for me and he just said his phone battery was low. Now my question is could Snapchat be wrong with the charge? Because it showed that it was on like 60. He said his phone was on 5 but we texted for a while after so Im not sure what to do anymore really. I dont want to believe that hes lying to me but everything else says otherwise please help me with this. And after that argument he turned off his location completely because how could I speak to him in that way but I was genuinely going through some kind of psychotic breakdown overthinking it",

    "title": "Bf 31m planning computer gaming around 34f 5 year anniversary. How do I deal with this?",
    "text": "Bf and I have been together for 5 years. Weve notoriously had issues with his lack of effort and my constant effort mismatch, giving abd having excitement or energy for stuff and our future. I think he has adhd and gets off on big dopamine highs which wore off pretty quickly with me when the novelty was gone but he still has them for gaming and certain events or activities with other people. In the begining he seemed like a totally different person, love bombed the life out me and made me feel like he had plans and goals and just put tons of effort into me. So basically we are buying a house and getting married soon, everything is lined up to go and serious which is making me panic at realising Im still carrying all the weight and relationship alone whilst he coasts along and enjoys the benefits whilst giving not much back besides companionship. Effort without me prompting it is basically non existent from him. Its our 5 year anniversary coming up from when we got together, I never celebrate things like this and hes messed up almost all my birthdays and valentines days so this one was going to be a celebration of us and my belief that things had changed presumably at the weekend following the actual date which is Wednesday. Instead today he told me that a game path of exile has a new league coming out on Friday and so he thought hed take Thursday/Friday off work so we could go out on Wednesdays on the actual day and then he could play path of exile on Friday. He would then take the following week off also so he could stay home and game. Hes played this game every single league its come out, so replaying the same content again and again basically. I obviously wasnt jumping for joy at his statement that the weekend was now about his gaming with no regards to the fact I couldnt take the day off work or even thinking about it. So he asked if we could do the anniversary the weekend before instead... This wouldnt really even have been an issue if our relationship was balanced tbh. If he put me first, Id know this was coming up and he was looking forward to it so Id reorientate the plans to let him play his game. But its not he doesnt, he just tries to figure out whats best for him first then gets defensive if that upsets me. This is just the last 5 years in a nut shell. Even the house hunting was all me, contacting letting agents, viewings, working out finances, putting in an offer, getting a mortgage set up, asking for marriage... I even negotiated the price on my own wedding rings. And I ask him what he wants and he says its not that I dont want these things, I dont know what I want until its happening, I just dont work like you... Im happy with all this and it happening but I just dont work the same and thats ok, I just dont set goals because every step forward in our relationship, life and wte else is me and he just works and plays games and doesnt even seem excited to try to make me happy or arrange things for us to be happy doing together, because hed rather play games in his spare time watch YouTube 24/7 of other people playing games when he finishes work that try to find stuff for us to do together. I feel so terrified and alone but weve bought rings and set up a mortgage. He keeps telling me he hears me every conversation like this but nothing changes. Hes went through a point where he said I was right, he didnt want to get to 80 and reflect on life and realise he hasnt done anything but here we are months later and hes still not done anything or so much as arranged a date for us. I feel so empty and defeated and dont know what to do because my whole life, plans, house Im about to own, financial stability and future plummets to barely affording rent solo at the current mental prices which are more than a mortgage payment if I leave nevermind owning a house. But Im deeply unhappy with how passive my partner is about life and effort he puts into us and our future together.",

    "text": "TLDR: My32M Wife28F has been sending flirty pictures to a random guy for over 3 years and recently sent a nude video. Weve been together almost 9 years and married a little over 6. How to restore trust, or know it cant be. Today I opened my wifes Snapchat to send our mutual friend a snap, as our oldest child had my phone. I have never had a reason to not trust her but I saw a name I didnt recognize and decided to click it. She sent a nude video 11 days ago. She has been sending normal cute/flirty photos occasionally for nearly three years nowsame she was sending me. I asked her about it and she said it meant nothing, that it was just for attention. I asked if I was giving her enough attention and she said that I was but that his attention was just a little different and made her feel goodbody image issues since childbirth. I have no clue how to proceed. It freaking hurts but it doesnt feel like it should be a big deal, but it is. Nearly three freaking years is whats getting me. Her initial response was I was going through a rough patch to which I responded , for three years? it started when she was dealing with some pretty bad post partum depression after the birth of our first, we have had another since then, only 7 months old. I admittedly was not the best through post partum, I tried but Ive never been that great with others emotions, can barely handle my own, on the spectrum. We got her therapy during all that and it seemed to help a lot, just not enough I guess. I asked her what was the plan, this was just a random stranger, never met in person, she simply responded there wasnt one, that she regrets it but doesnt know. Ive told her I want to be able to forgive her but that I cant make any promises and just need some time. I know its ultimately my decision but just wanted to see how others overcome broken trust. Talked with a good friend earlier that allowed me to talk with her more but it just happened this morning and I can still feel the shock and betrayal that washed over me when I saw that saved Snapchat. I did not expect it at all and just dont understand how this happens or why people do these things. She says that was the only explicit chat but my trust is broken now and just have so much running through my head. We have otherwise had a great relationship, we arent 100 into each others hobbies and interests but we do share the biggest parts of our personalities with the other. Have any of you successfully rebuilt trust before and how did you do so?",

    "text": "i have an ex who was abusive to me, physically and emotionally, ive since then broken up with him and moved very far away from him, im talking other side of the country like 2500 miles away. i never filed a report against him for domestic violence while we were together because at the time, i was scared of him and what hed possibly do. he would verbally threaten to unalive himself or unalive me. So once I finally got away and moved, I thought I would be safe and finally be done with it all. But he has been harassing me over the internet for the past 7 months. i got a new phone number so thankfully he does not know my new number. he might know my current address because its my familys address that we used to visit together for vacations when we were dating but im not sure if he knows im here. i blocked him on every social media platform but he still finds a way to make new accounts and contact me. i blocked him on Gmail but it doesnt do anything, his emails automatically go straight to my trash bin but i can still see them.. so much for gmails block feature. He has also made multiple new email addresses to email me as well. Anyways, its getting out of hand and I think now I want to file a police report against him for harassment. Will they turn me away if I have responded to his messages and emails to me?? The messages consist of him promising me that he is a better man and wants to make things work, but I constantly tell him to please leave me alone. and ive also said some mean words to him to really get my point across. so i dont know if my report will get taken seriously because they might think im enabling or entertaining my abuser but really i just want to be left alone for good Location: Connecticut and his location is california.",

The only problem being it be like two opposite corners of the country so its really far apart. We have known each other for almost 2 years but recently she started ignoring me and I confronted her she said its cause she was hitting 27 next month and was thinking about the future and how she is at an age to get married and she might get married in 1-2 years. She brought our age into question, how our parents might not end up agreeing and there is also how religion could be an issue. I love her and I dont see issues here except for education as I am not done yet but I have been working and if marriage were to be brought up I will be able to take care of us. She is a doctor and I havent done my masters yet. I dont think I can live my life without her like I have been through a lot and she is the first relationship I have had but I also know I dont want nobody but her. Its really late at night for me atm so I cant type properly but I will edit in or add in the comments if I have more to add But do you think we should just end it off here. She suggested us just being friends but I dont want that To add to this I also suggested we meet up somewhere soon or put out an idea where we could move in somewhere while she works and I study and work. Do you think this is a good idea Edit: she also said when I start studying I could be happier finding someone who is younger and apparently more pretty? she is everything to me and idk how to go on about this properly like its really late at night and I havent been able to sleep so I apologize if this whole text ends up coming out weird but she literally makes my day with her smile alone and If I have had a bad day her laugh alone would make all my problems disappear. She is so beautiful to me that I am honestly surprised she even liked me to begin with 2 years ago. I want to grow old with her I want to have a family with her Like I know I am being selfish but I dont want to let this go and I know she doesnt either.",

He changed his argument from thats not true, to well, thats different. I said to him, how so?

If its a woman, shes a bitch and hoe? Got it. I also said to him why ask this question if you know you wont like the answer?

    "text": "Need some advice. Context: Im straight male in friend group with two girls both straight. We met in law school, and were about to start our second year together. Were pretty close and like hanging out. We all share similar interests and hates. We have a group chat where we often text each other when were away from each other. However, I also often dm one of them Girl 1 about stuff too. I think this happens more often than I dm the other one Girl 2 or even text in our three way group chat. We talk a lot and often late into the night. I think its also important to mention that before I became close friends with them, they both were close friends with each other for months. Issue: Heres my issue, we all hit it off very well but lately Ive started to develop feelings for Girl 1. I didnt at first, but Im slowly and surely becoming more and more attracted to her. I also feel like its likely she has for me too. But I cant totally tell. I havent acted on those emotions at all. When we text Girl 1 and I, its usually very platonic and comedic. We make each other laugh constantly or we collectively complain about other people we know. Currently, both of the girls are on a school summer trip to France. Girl 1 is constantly dming me about whats happening on the trip. They also mention things in the group chat too, but its usually Girl 1 and I dming. Im not sure what to do, and could really use some advice.",

    "text": "Me 23m and gf 22f have been together for 6 years since hs and our relationship has been pretty good. Over the years one issue weve had is bedroom issues with me having a higher libido and never really being satisfied in the relationship. I was sexually abused when I younger and dont have the best relationship with sex. But regardless of that I still think I have a general idea of what I want. Ive gotten to this conclusion because I dont feel sexually desired by my gf at all, she has now brought up abstinence for the second time after a pregnancy scare in our relationship where Ive complained about not having enough sex. She just doesnt think its that important and thats fine but with my past I just dont want that but I also dont want to have a gf who is having forced sex with me. I still enjoy my gfs company and we have lots in common, when she brought up abstinence last week I told her I would rather break up with her and we could still be friends but she says we cant. I didnt say it during the conversation but to be honest she already feels like a friend to me anyways and I dont see why we cant continue this. My gf has also started me down my current career path and I dont want to lose her support during that as she has been a big help in that area. But I just dont know how to save the friendship if we split.",

    "text": "Ok so we have been dating for 6 months and i asked him if this weekend he would be free to do something, he responded i wont be free those days bc im going on a camping trip with some friends Sunday - Tuesday morning. i am free any day besides those :. I hadnt responded to his text bc I was working and three hours after he texted me that he texted me to invite me, he said would you wanna come, it would be sunday - tuesday. i can leave on monday since i know you work tuesday. do you think he is being genuine? does he actually want me to come? or does he not want to hurt my feelings and feels obligated? I find the weird three hour pause between telling me he had those plans and couldnt hang to then inviting me? why not invite me initially if thats what he wanted?",

Most of my net worth, is tied up on my ranch, cattle, rental properties, and equipment, since theyre 100 paid for. I have everything under one LLC, but theyre separated into 4 separate divisions. Would forming a trust be the best option for tax purposes? I want to have a salary and be paid every week or two, nothing crazy, maybe 1500-2000? I used to have a job, so I would use that salary to pay for my bills, and the cash flow that I would get from my business, I would just reinvest back into my businesses. I have no employees at the moment, either I do the work, or I contact out the work, but in the future I am looking to hire workers for my construction company, since I plan on having a crew that hangs steel, and another that pours concrete. I consider myself somewhat frugal, pretty much everything I spend money on, outside of food, bills, and entertainment, is for my business. I would love to hear the feedback yall have!",

Without going into too much detail publicly, our system was activated without utility permission or county approval, and the utility has since confirmed that no NEM agreement was ever submitted.

But I got love bombed, and Im healing and accepted the fact that there was no chance, which I made peace with myself. However, during the time I was flirting with this guy, I had sent pictures of my figure in tight clothing in, like, arched poses black shorts and a T-shirt. Most of them didnt show my face and I dont talk to any of his freinds Im trying to forget him but these photos are whats bothering me the most which is why I havent cut contacts with him. This is freaking me out, as I dont know if I can get in trouble, as he had sent me way worse stuff. For someone I thought I knew was trustworthy and kind, it made me realize I actually dont know him as well as I think. We dont go to the same school, but its still getting me anxious, but safe to say Im never doing something like this again. Will this ruin my future??? And how do I cut him off from my life gently",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. Hes an incredibly kind man, kindest person Ive ever met, but our communication style is so different. Right now, were in a long-distance relationship its quite personal so lets us assume that its a work thing, and the issue is that he doesnt communicate in a way that makes me feel emotionally connected. Ive told him that a simple 5-minute weekly call would be enough for me we text each other daily but I hate texting, but its been almost two weeks since our last call, and Im always the one initiating. I hate doing that because it feels like Im begging for his attention. So, I stopped calling him and texted him that I needed time off the internet, mostly because I just didnt want to talk to him anymore. Ive been through a lot in my past, lets say a lot of people did many illegal things to me r-word. Ive tried therapy before, but it didnt help and only made me feel more depressed, so Im hesitant to try again. I did talk to him about how much I just wanna have a 5 minute talk weekly and thats all I want. He said he would try but its been a whole month and he didnt even call me once I always called him. But most of all, I dont want to keep talking about my emotion yknow. I talked to him a lot about it, and how much I need him to just call me, but its all for nothing. Its so frustrating because I feel like whenever we talk about my needs, Im talking to a wall that knows how to speak comfort words. But a wall is not a human. And now Im at a point where Im not sure if Im just too hurt or if this relationship isnt right for me anymore, but I dont want to leave him because hes a genuinely good person whos always been there for me. Im just feeling really emotionally drained and unsure of what to do.",

    "text": "This is hard for me to share, but Ive been feeling alone in this situation, and Im not sure I can talk to my friends about it, let alone family.. My 30m boyfriend we will call him Eli, we met online gaming through my brother years ago, we have been friends since then, and we became best friends about two years ago. Back in middle of March I was going through a rough patch emotionally, and mentally. Both of my parents were having health issues, and were in the hospital at the same time. I live with my mom, so her not being home and the house being empty made my mental health worse. And Eli at the time was there for me, we were in the phone a lot so I didnt feel alone. Those late night calls turned into deep conversations that led to more than just best friends. He had made me realize I had feelings for him that I was unaware of. I was very vulnerable at the time and it seemed like these conversations just kept happening and not going anywhere, which led me to be more unstable and vulnerable. I eventually bit the bullet and was very honest and blunt with him, that what ever happened I would never want to lose him because hes my best friend. Well, we eventually got together, and weve been together for about two and half months, and we are long distance Ive never met him physically, but we do plan to see each other soon. Eli is amazing honestly, the healthiest relationship Ive ever had even though its only been a short period of time. I have noticed he tends to pay attention more to this one app he has, which is Ai chats. Eli has had emotional sexual conversations with this Ai app. And Im confused and honestly a little hurt as to why he would need those, let alone continue to use them when hes got me. I havent spoken to him about it yet, and I honestly dont think I want to, and I may be wrong for that. I had an ex who used Ai a lot, and maybe theres trauma from that as well. I just feel like Im alone, and that Im not good enough. And Im starting to think even if I was with him physically hed still be drawn to talking to Ai. I just want more of his attention, and I feel like Im asking for too much, overthinking this.",

    "title": "Why do i feel weird about my boyfriend commenting on my body?",
    "text": "My boyfriend 18M and I 18F have been dating for 2 years. Initially he was a very sweet person, seemed extremely polite, respectful for a teenager boy, yk? Never commented on my body in a lustful manner like he would absolutely adore the living shit out of it, compliment me, tell me how beautiful I look, or how sweet I am and etc the usual. But slowly as we progress, there have been few times where we have talked about intimacy etc, and it was perfectly fine but for some time I havent been feeling the best and i feel like he figured that out and has toned it down. Like doesnt necessarily compliments my body- just my face or my outfit etc. Now the thing is, I have quite the big tits- and that has been an insecurity of mine- and recently we were talking about this. Now he did ask my permission if he could say something but i did not expect what he did say. He said that sometimes he looks at my tits intentionally as he finds them attractive? Is it weird, that i feel a little uncomfortable by that? He has always made sure that my comfort is the priority but i just want to know if Im overreacting by saying that I feel a little uncomfortable. ps: first time posting here so please excuse any error in the formatting or grammatical mistakes, thanku",
