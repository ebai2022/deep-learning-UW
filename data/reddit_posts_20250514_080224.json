Applying for FAFSA and looking into other careers, but I dont know what I would ever go back to college for. Got a wife and kiddo, and I would like to do something that doesnt send me back to shiftwork. I have a window of time for unemployment and can attend community College for very cheap.

    "title": "How do i explain to my mom 50f that i 18f dont want extended family at my graduation?",
    "text": "im 18f struggling after a conversation i had this evening with my family and would really appreciate some advice. im graduating from high school in a week and every senior was given 8 tickets to invite anyone they want. for context, my parents both come from households were their parents are divorced. only both my grandpas ever remarried. i have 4 grandmas and 2 grandpas, though my moms father sadly passed away. my grandpa on my dads side and my grandma, his wife, are the people who have accepted so far. aside from that i have my dad 50m and my mom 50f who are coming. my brother 20m lives 2 hours away and is flippant on wether or not hes coming. i wanted to have a small group of people there who id be able to have a nice time with. im not close to most of my extended family as i am autistic and after covid i became withdrawn around them because i was uncomfortable with communicating. this has not gotten better the last 5 years, despite therapy. my grandparents on my dads side are people that make the effort to see and talk to me, even though most of my extended family doesnt try to have conversations with me anymore. im most comfortable around them so i was ok with them going. i invited my dads mom and my moms mom, but both said theyre unable to attend because theyre handicapped. the problem began when i told my mom that because i was unable to fill the seats, i was giving away my tickets to my friends who need more as they have large families. my mom got upset and told me that she would fill those seats, no matter what. i told her that i would prefer to give my seats away as theres no one else who id want to go that i hadnt already invited. i thought that was the end of the conversation but i was wrong. i overheard her on the phone with my brother saying she had invited 9 people. i was shocked and immediately got angry, telling her that i didnt want her to invite anyone and it made me uncomfortable for her to invite people without me knowing. she told me the only people she invited were all my grandparents and my uncle her brother i explained that my two grandmas had already declined. she said she changed their minds, but i feel like she bullied them into agreeing. my dads mom didnt want to go because my grandpa, who she had a nasty divorce with, was gonna be there, and she is disabled anyway so its hard to get around. my other grandma is disabled with a recently injured knee, so it felt like she pressured her into agreeing as well. my mom got angry and told me that she didnt want me using any of my tickets on my friends when i have so much family. she also invited my fourth and final grandma without my say. she was married to my late grandpa and i hardly see her. she doesnt talk to me much either. shes the mother of my uncle, who my mom invited. when i told her that she shouldnt have done that, my brother who was still on the phone intervened and told me that it was absurd i wanted to use the tickets on my friends and not my family. my dad, who was trying to keep the peace, defended me and told my brother and mom that i was allowed to choose who to and to not invite. this was a back and forth for a while, with my mother cracking a bit and telling me that my grandma who was married to my moms dad is taking the seat of my grandpa who wouldve been here had he been alive. it made me pretty uncomfortable to hear her to say that, as my mom doesnt even talk to this grandma that much. i feel guilty by uninviting her as my mom already sent her a text and i guess id be fine if she went but it just makes me so uncomfortable for her to invite people behind my back. my mom has a history of not being ok with me being so distant from my extended family, but i dont see love the same way my mom and brother do. i think ive talked with my school friends more than i ever have with most of my extended family, and to me, thats love. every family event makes my skin crawl as ill have to see and hug all these people when they hardly know me at all. i dont know if thats just my autism, but i feel like its whats causing this big divide. my friends on the other hand have really close families and the fact they have enough people they love to invite not only 8 people, but still need more is why im very inclined to give away my tickets. my dad understands me more, he uses me as an excuse sometimes to get out of extended family occasions early, even when my mom wants to stay longer. my brother is more like my mom in his love of our extended family. i think thats the reason why we cant see eye to eye on this, but i also need outside opinions, am i being unreasonable for only wanting family thats close to ME specifically? my moms accused me of favoring my dads side as im ok inviting both my grandparents on his side, but thats just because they make an effort for me. i have a therapy appointment on thursday where i can talk about this, so i need help coming up with ways to explain my point of view to my mom. im sorry if this is formatted weird, this is my first time using reddit. thank you !",

I had gotten into it with an ex roommate about money that he offered to pay, dude was ghosting me when it got time to pay bills, I saw him at work one day and i casually asked him if hed still be able to pay and he had an attitude about it and said he didnt know when he could pay, I left alone and said nothing else to him for the reminder of the shift. The next day on my off-day he texts me saying that he wasnt gonna pay and I need to figure it out and stop harassing him, me being a dumbass out of anger replied and said a couple of things that he took offense of and ended up reporting it to our ethics hotline. Let this guy stay in my house for damn near 3 years just paying rent and minimum bills, dudes car gets repossessed and me and my girl gave him rides free of charge because instead of buying a car he wants to by guitars so he can start a band in his 30s smh really feel like a complete idiot, you help people and they stab you in the back and act like youre the bad guy",

    "text": "I need help. We started dating 3 years ago and back then I was going through a very dark time in my life. He knew about it too. I had suicidal thoughts and problems with my self image, family issues amongst some other things. I had broken up with him after about 3 months into our relationship but we talked it out and got back together. Ive always loved him so so much so I wanted to make it work even though I didnt think love would ever work out for me. I just didnt feel like it would last because of my lack of self esteem and I thought he didnt actually love me he just wanted me for a while. Now I am doing a lot better, I have started going to therapy and I am now on antidepressants and gained some healthy weight which also helped with my self esteem problems. My issue is, back in the beginning of our relationship when I was hopeless and stupid, I sometimes went out with my cousins and we drank a bit. I also had a vape. He doesnt know about this because at the time I didnt think our relationship would last anyway and I was so down in life I just wanted to quit. I also smoked some cigarettes with my friends in other occasions which I also never told him about until lately when he actually out of curiosity asked me if I ever had smoked with my smoker friends. I have lied by omission until now but lying directly was harder for me so I said yes I did and explained what kind of feelings I had back then. I dont smoke anymore at all though it was just at that time and went on for like a good 5 months. He was very disappointed to say the least. He said he would need to build the trust again but hed forgive me. He also asked if there was more that he didnt know and I didnt mention the drinking, because I was scared hed leave me. I love him so so much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him but I think he might leave me if I say everything. It was just the beginning of our relationship and I didnt do anything stupid with anyone or something. I just feel horrible and guilty and like he doesnt deserve this at all and I wish I could turn back time to change everything. Would you tell him or keep it to yourself?",

    "text": "Okay so heres the thing. My friend got caught stealing literally the month after her 18th birthday shes born in august, this happened in September. We left the store and were still in the mall before the guy grabbed her and brought her back into the store saying how I was going to let you go. The security kept on asking for information like he was a cop himself and kept on identifying himself as one. We told him, she just turned 18 and this is actually her first offence. The security guard ignored the fact that she just turned 18 and was trying to give her the biggest fine. The police officer arrived almost an hour after and only talked to the security guard outside the room, then proceeded to ask my friend if she needed cuffs, brought her to the car and fined her 65. We had questions and wanted to plead our case but we were advised by the police officer to tell her to pay the fine of 65 and that trespassing will be on her record for 3 years. How will this affect her record? She wants to become a doctor, is that out the window now? Does she have the opportunity to plead her case and clear her record? Location: Ontario, Canada",

Gods in their domain. And then theres me. Im highly qualified. On paper, Ive done well. But somehow, Ive never felt like I became great at anything. Ive dabbled in different fields, picked up a lot, but I never reached that level where I felt like an expert, where others look to me as the person to go to. Its not that Im lazy or unmotivated. I work hard. I care. But theres this lingering feeling that Ive missed the markthat despite my credentials, I havent really arrived anywhere. Im not even sure what I expect from posting this. Maybe just to know if anyone else out there feels the same. If youve ever felt like a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

During that time we were in contact he had a girlfriend he moved in with and was taking really serious. they ended up being toxic together and he has told me he was hurt a lot by her and etc. When i found out who is ex was, Of course i went to look at her acc most girls do this and i would compare myself. I deleted ALL social media accounts for ONE of those reasons. i wanted to get away, restrict myself and try to be better. This last about 5 months. Recently i got back my social media and the first thing i did was go look at her accounts. I always feel sick to my stomach when i do but i cant stop. I always see her new post. i know it sounds bad and weird but i cant stop and i try not to but it just happens. And i get that sick to my stomach feeling all over again. I tell my boyfriend stuff like its cuz im not your ex huh or you liked her more you lived with her mind you they moved in together super fast like in months of dating. I tell him as a silly way not being like mad or rude about it. just some unnecessary comments i throw out there and he just laughs it off. but the other day he said when are you going to stop bringing her up i dont care about her and it really hit me that im not okay with my obsession with her : i feel mentally sick and i dont wanna look back in my boyfriends past and dwell on it or keep looking at her accounts and think to myself wow shes perfect and so cool than me i want and need advice. I feel like crying typing this and crazy . :",

    "text": "I have four adult children. Two were adopted as babies and two were naturally born. After a terrible divorce from my attorney husband, his parental alienation has left them not speaking to me, even though I was a good mother. The adopted ones are long gone and the other two are still in contact with me to a minimal degree. I.e. no birthday or Mothers Day texts, but a thx mom if I text happy birthday to them. My question: Should I leave any of them in my will? Ive pretty much decided to not include the adopted ones bc I havent had contact with either in over 10 years and my oldest daughter had four boys I am not allowed to know, even though we both lived in the same town. But the other two are blood and Im able to have some contact. My son and his girlfriend attended my late husbands funeral last July their step dad who treated them well. My natural daughter spoke to him before he died. I have not mentioned an inheritance to any of them and Im hoping my relationship will improve by visiting them with my new husband. Hes hopeful he can fix it. Any thoughts? If I write all out of my will, my money would go to the church, where I am confident it would be used wisely.",

    "title": "My 21F boyfriends 25M recent interactions with a female friend have been bothering me",
    "text": "My boyfriend 25M and I 21F have been together for almost 1 year, and we have had our ups and downs, especially regarding his career. I am currently on the tail-end of my university course and work part-time on the weekends, while he completed his vocational studies shortly after high school and has not had a job since graduation, which can be attributed to his depression and insomnia. After we began dating, I encouraged him to go to the doctors to finally get some help regarding this, and since being medications and with repeated encouragement, he has begun applying to various jobs with little success. Due to his insomnia, he often stays up late far past midnight playing games, and recently he has been playing a specific game with Helen, an ex of one of his best friends who had been keeping in touch with him. Recently, he would be on a call with me and play with her, or if I had already gone to bed he would call her while playing. This is a game that I dont especially want to play due to its complexity, and I dont have enough free time to learn to play, and its just a game that he plays every now and then, so this bothered me slightly as the thought of him calling and playing a game I cant really be included in with another girl at 3am felt somewhat upsetting as he had previously told me that his sleep schedule or lack there of was holding him back from applying to jobs. I know that insomnia can sometimes be out of our control, but I just think that being in bed and attempting to sleep, rather than playing games until you fall asleep may be more helpful from a sleep hygiene perspective. There was also another time when my boyfriend was playing a duos game mode with her, and a friend watching their game had referred to her as his partner. I know they just used that word because theyre partners for that game, but he didnt try to correct him, or suggest him to use a different word due to the connotations. Him and Helen catch up every few months, whether it be a scheduled phone call or in person, and since she heard we had been dating, she has always expressed that she wanted to meet me. Ive also been invited to hangout with them when they do, however, there always seemed to be a clashing schedule so Ive never been able to make it. As I am quite a shy and reserved person, I generally try to interact with someone first online generally via playing a game together, so I suggested that maybe we play a game together that we all play, and my boyfriend was agreeable to the idea and so he has attempted to find a time for us to play together, however Helen works from home for long hours, and so she only really plays games after 2am, so this hadnt worked out for about 10 months as I have to wake up early almost every day. Basically as theyve been interacting a lot more recently, I just wanted to meet her to see what kind of person she was. Recently, when I was out for class, my boyfriend messaged me saying that Helens job may or may not have a position opening, and that she was willing to help him prepare for the interview, and that afterwards he would see if we could play a game together. I told him that I would be out almost all day due university and a birthday dinner I was going to, so it would just depend on how I was feeling. By the time I got home, I was totally exhausted and I told him, but I found out that they had been waiting to play with me for over an hour, so I felt guilty for making them wait, and ended up just sitting in call while they played as I would still get to meet her in a way. However, I just didnt feel like myself so I think I came across as a bit bitchy and just ended up muting myself and eventually dozed off. The next day I asked him how the interview preparation went, and he told me that she was tired so they ended up not doing any. This has made me feel really uneasy about the whole situation, mainly due to the fact that I felt so pressured to meet her that day, as wed not been able to sort out a time for us to meet until then, and it felt like the only opportunity to do so, despite me feeling like shit as Id been out for 12 hours and have a very short social battery, so I wasnt able to make a good first impression to her. Im not sure whether its just in my head, but to me it came off as though he has respected her boundaries and the fact that she was tired more than he respected my tiredness. Hes genuinely a kind guy to me and gets emotional and shuts down when Ive mentioned times when hes upset me. I think thats why Ive been bottling this up for some time, as I know it will just end up with him crying and me consoling him that it doesnt bother me much to try and calm him down, even though it does bother me quite a bit. I know it sounds silly but its just been bothering me quite a lot, and although it doesnt sound like it, I am grateful for Helen taking time out of her busy schedule to help him find a job and try to prepare him for the interview. Im just not sure if its my jealousy talking? I would love to get an outsiders perspective on things.",

    "text": "Hi everyone, Im wondering how I can mend this frustration and stop being upset with my poor sweet loving boyfriend for simply being a novice at the gym. Theres a couple of factors that go into this. 1. When I try to coach him, he doesnt listen and usually will respond by naming some obscure muscle group that is stopping him from doing the exercise how I suggest. This annoys me because in my eyes, he knows all these muscle groups but not how to do a chest fly. It feels like either overcompensating, or some level of an ego. Im wondering how I can either reduce my ego here or improve his willingness to learn from me. Part of me thinks he feels weird learning from me because I am a woman. However, he has NEVER indicated that he wouldnt learn from a woman. I think it may be subconscious? 2. That leads me into my second point, where Im wondering if theres deeper issues to mend, I.e. why can a man not be a novice at the gym? I think in my head, Im so used to men not welcoming me into a gym/acting like I know nothing that when one knows less than me my brain short circuits. 3. We talked about this before and he said hes been playing sports and working out for 8 years, working out for 3 more seriously. This bugs me because why dont you know this simple form then? It seems like hes trying to prove hes a gymbro or something while at the same time not being one. No need to be a gymbro btw, I dont care for that. Im more annoyed that it seems hes creating this persona that he isnt. Any tips on how I can fix my mindset? Im pretty sure Im the problem here, even with how I worded things. So Im wondering how I can be more accepting? If thats the issue?",

After, which, he ignored my messages about the upstairs neighbors having a cat despite it being against the lease and I being heavily allergic he claimed to have talked to them, but yet, the cat is still there, asthmatic, and on a sleep apnea machine. Their cat is such a shedder, that weve gotten its hair through the vents gas air heating. It sucks, because I do love cats and I sadly was cursed with being allergic. But, he ignored it all and suddenly asked us on a really busy week to let him in our apartment to give a realtor a tour to just determine the value and not sell. He repeatedly hasnt taken no for an answer and told us just hoping you can do me a favor and be flexible this one time as if we didnt cancel multiple things in the past just for him to cancel on the same day only 30 minutes prior multiple times. We told him no, and that wed even pay the late fee for cancelling even though we tried to cancel 24 hours prior to and he kept insisting on it on the basis that the realtor is busy. We are, too. He caught us on a week that had multiple parties, and preparing for a new baby to where there is boxes and toys everywhere from our other little one. As well as furniture being rearranged. I was stressed preparing for my childs birthday the previous day with the constant back and forth that while cutting veggies for a veggie stray, I cut into my knuckle and caused nerve damage. My finger, has numbness. But even with the added fact that I suffered a physical injury while pregnant, he is still insistent. He just seems so pushy about it, that Im concerned this is proof he is selling it. And, Im wondering, can he force his way in here to show the apartment despite use wanting it to be organized and that we might not even be here for the showing? We have already had a cooler stolen the last time we had let people he hired into our apartment while we were gone. We dealt with so much, from them not disclosing a bug infestation before we moved in and only did when they started showing during the summer wood eating bugs because the basement laundry room was severely left unfinished with wood directly on the dirt surface with JUST kitchen plastic roll on tiling to cover the surface. He got a exterminator who even told him to fix that and he didnt til the NEXT YEAR. In this economy, its too expensive to move. Far too expensive with little housing in our area where work is.. Does it seem like hes selling it and does he have a right to still push entry/force entry for something like a realtor showing?",

I work long days but tend to get more off per week, but on the days Im off he will be working, Ive tried to bring up that the excessive amount of meeting is affecting me, but I think I dont get my emotions out correctly or my point across. Currently he is away on a work trip, hes hardly spoken to me all day, out till 1am last night with colleagues, I was on nightshift and he never even text or mentioned he was having a big night. I suppose Im just feeling a bit lonely but I also feel bad for bringing it up as I want to support him doing a job he loves.

Not a shallow one that skims the surface but one that touches the bottom of your soul Let it fill the dark corners where fear still sleeps Let it remind you that you are not broken only heavy with what was never yours to carry forever You were given a vessel Not a cage Not a burden But a living temple made to move through pain and into presence It is yours free and clear Not your mothers Not your fathers Not your traumas So take the wheel Stop waiting for someone to rescue you or for the waters to calm before you rise The sea was made for storms and you were made for the sea I am not your captain I am not your god I am only a lighthouse I have seen the rocks and I have kissed them with blood I am trying to keep you from them but I cannot steer for you That light you see That still quiet glow just over the wave That is not me That is Him The architect of your ribs The whisper in your breath The hand behind your heartbeat Ask Him how to run this vessel Ask not from fear but from fire Not as a slave begging for orders but as a son reclaiming his birthright If you are hurting good That means you are still alive That means you still feel That means the soul has not yet drowned Now feel it all then move even if your legs shake even if your voice cracks move with grace or move with rage but for Gods sake move You do not have to be healed to begin You only have to begin to be healed Let your stillness be a sword Let your silence speak louder than screams Let your peace shame the chaos that tried to break you And when you feel lost look up The light is not far It is within It is behind your eyes and under your tongue and buried deep in the marrow your father blessed This is your vessel This is your time Sail And if I go silent know it is only because I am praying for wind in your sails and watching from the cliffs where the old men still cry when a child makes it home You are not alone You never were You never will be",

Im losing faith that I will never find love I am extremely shy and guarded and insecure so its a struggle for me but People say put yourself out there so I try to be myself and be honest but none of my love interests last more than a month and Im starting to wonder if theres something wrong with me? Here are some issues that I face when being open and honest Experience- Ive had a lot of trauma in my life. I wasnt allowed to date until I was 16yrs old and I respected my mother enough to listen to that rule. She ended up passing when I was 16 so I didnt end up dating. The loss of her was to much to focus on men or boys. I never got to experience high school love. By the time I was ready to date which was around 18 I put myself out there but not as much. I would go on small dates here and there but nothing long term until I met this guy via MySpace and allowed myself to get catfished for almost 3yrs. Never do that its not worth your time. This made my sexual experience physically non existent but we would sext so I was open to exploring my sexuality. I was finally able to wake up from the fantasy of him and had a few flings but I was shy when it came to sex because I was 22 with no sexual experience. I was sexually physical with two men but it never went further than 3rd base and I stayed a virgin until I was 24 because I was waiting for someone special. I felt worthy that no man touched me for that long, I was proud and never ashamed but I noticed that the men I told always had an issue with it so it took longer for me to find the right partner but I knew my worth and was not going to settle. Heres where it all went down hill I never lost my virginity it was taken against my will by a coworker I thought I trusted and confided in. He date raped me one night I was celebrating my promotion. To say that i didnt trust being near men after that is an understatement. It destroyed my self worth I stopped dating for a year. I decided to stay celibate again until I found the right person but I was lonely so I changed my mind and lost my revirginity to a friend I didnt enjoy the experience at all so it was a one night stand with a friend. We never had sex again. I became celibate again and met someone who made me feel so much attraction like I couldnt resist him. No one ever made me feel that way before and I was so sexually attracted to him but he sensed I was inexperienced and I felt like he was not interested in me enough long term so I ended things when he couldnt answer what he wanted between us after a month of dating. We never had sex I wanted to be sure. I was 26 by that time. I was so lonely but I still didnt give up putting myself out there. The trauma of the rape took a toll on me by this time. I started being wreckless and drinking and I was lonely. I wont get into much detail but I had 3 sexual experiences with strangers and only once. Im mortified to say this but Ive literally only had sex 4 times and was raped once. I have no other physical sexual experiences. Most of the time I just watch porn or sext online. Im now celibate another 5yrs. Ive tried not telling men because Im not an open book and Ive also tried telling them. Ive tried casual sex its not for me obviously. Ive tried the opposite sex Im not sexually attracted to them. Ive tried being honest and said I want long term. No one I speak with is looking for that or they gaslight me into thinking they want the same and go radio silent after really getting to know me. No good male role models- I was molested as a child and my father is a dead beat. Ive dated all different types of men but I dont know what a real man looks like. All of the male role models in my life arent great examples to base a romantics connection off of. I dont really have many male friend for traumatic reasons. I struggle with my self worth and value. I dont feel worthy of love. I feel extremely tainted and I dont value myself sometimes. Im getting better now but as soon as I put myself out there again I keep getting the same result. How I carry myself I feel like I give off this aura of damaged goods and sexual deviant and those are the men that gravitate toward me. Id like to believe I am very attractive so Im constantly over sexualized which makes me feel disgusted. Lastly I dont know what I want- I just know what I dont. I wrote down all the qualities and things I want in someone but since Im losing faith that will never happen for me. Im slowly contemplating whether I should just settle. I think sometime I should just meet someone and just have sex with no emotions or attachment but I know deep down this isnt what I want. I know I want a deep connection and friendship that leads to love I am a sexual person but I want to have sex with the right person and idk what to do anymore I need help I am currently in therapy- I was diagnosed with Severe PTSD from my trauma- I am not sure if this also contributes to why I always get rejected",

Tldr got betrayed a year ago, due to previous trauma apologized for god forbid getting mad about it about it, so now asking myself if its worth to express how fucked up these people were with me, whether to them or to somebody else",

    "text": "A few days ago we had a long argument/conversation. I feel as though I have to aching feeling that this isnt my long lasting relationship I thought it would be. Theres things about him that irk me and I wrote everything in my notes for him to read. He ended up reading it early before I woke up which started the whole thing from 6pm to 3am. I talked to my sister about the whole thing because we were on the edge of a breakup, and she said I should give him the 3 months left of our lease to try and work it out. I agreed and now its a week later. But I just feel like since then I have been slowly falling out of love? Like I feel distant. Its been a constant problem for me to want to express any sexual relationship with him. I know not everyone is perfect and we agreed to try and work on it for the next few months to test the waters but Im not sure. It feels as though even though I agreed to try and work it out, my mind has already made the decision in the back of my head to leave at the end of the 3 months. I feel horrible and I know he loves me so much but when he says it to me I feel so uncomfortable saying it back because Im not sure if I truly feel that way or not. And Id feel bad about asking him not to say it or expect me to say it back since he was begging me to stay and it might seem like I am pushing him away. Im so scared to do the wrong thing, like maybe I am just overthinking and itll all work out, but still in the back of my mind I want to be able to end it all and go home to find an apartment with my sister. I feel so detached sometimes and without even thinking I make an annoyed face behind his back when he says something. Like hes not a bad guy but I feel like hes not the guy for me.",

    "text": "My bf likes to spend a lot of money on me. I dont even ask he just gives it to me. He buys me flowers and gifts etc. And the thing is he is a bit older while I am still in college so I feel kind of bad when I cant get him anything like he can. There have been days he will randomly take me somewhere like the aquarium or the fair and he even put his card info into my phone so I can DoorDash food anytime I want. The other day he even said hes saving up to get me a car for my bday in a couple months cause he has been hearing me complain about public transportation a lot and I felt so happy but also kind of bad because I cant really return the favor as of yet. Like I cook for him sometimes and make him jewelry with my knock off kit lve had for a few years but it doesnt add up to what he buys me. Any other women have gone though this? How did you deal with it? Did u just accept?",

Our relationship has never been perfect as if any relationship is, and before I got pregnant, we often fought a lotsometimes even threatening to break up. I dont even remember what we were fighting about most of the time. Our first semester had just ended when I found out I was pregnant. When I saw the two lines, my heart was filled with joy, but of course, I was also scared. Im almost done with college my boyfriend didnt continue college he chose to work instead. I immediately messaged him about the result. At first, he seemed happy, but later that evening, he told me he wasnt ready. He explained whyof course, I understood. I still have one semester before graduation, and were not financially stable. But I felt a little pain in my chest.Before, he used to tell me how much he wanted to have a child with mesaying all these things, blah blah, nada nada. I never told him this, but instead, I suggested that we terminate the pregnancy through medication, and he agreed. Afterward, I did a lot of thinking. I told my friends about the pregnancy, and then I changed my mind. I became scared of losing the child. When I told him about my decision to keep the baby, he accepted it. Now that Im nearing my due date, Ive started asking myself if Im truly ready to be with him. I love our baby. I know Im ready to become a motherbut Ive begun to realize I cant even imagine a future with my partner. Sometimes, I even wish it was someone else. Thats when I started questioning: Do I really love him, or have we just been together so long that Ive grown comfortable? He is a good manhe has his flaws, and so do I. But whenever I think about the future, the only image that comes to mind is me leaving him. TBH, sometimes I regret having the baby because I am starting to realize that there were things I wanted to do after graduating like travelling, of course my boyfriend knows that. But, I also dont want to blame our child. Why do I feel this way? Is it just pregnancy hormones?",

    "text": "Good morning, I have been dating myM29 gfF29 for 5 years now. Little over a month ago I found out the my gf was on a psychic app asking if her ex from 10 years ago still is in love with her even tho he just had a child with another woman. She said that the relationship was with him 4 months and he cheated on her which is why they broke up and she told me that she asked the psychics about him to get closure which I dont believe. Why would she need closure over someone she dated for 4 months that was 10 years ago? After she dated him she went on to date her other ex boyfriend the one right before me and had a toxic abusive relationship with him which shes told me all about. The thing is she never really mentioned about the ex she asked the psychics about. When his name was brought up before she never went into detail about him making it seem like their relationship wasnt really anything but now Im not so sure Any advice on how I can handle this would be greatly appreciated. Things havent been too tense since I found out but the situation still lingers in my mind",

    "title": "Divorce agreement",
    "text": "Hi all. I recently around a month ago left my husband due to irreconcilable differences and left my jointly owned house to stay with a friend. When he realised I wasnt coming back, he asked me to move out of the house - this was within 3-4 days of me leaving. I did so, and didnt take anything from the house no furniture, no nothing except my own possessions such as clothing. Weve recently started the divorce process and seem to be getting differing legal advice on our financial split. I earn around 45,000 and he earns around 68,000 per year. Ive taken one car which is paid off but is quite old and has around 80,000 miles on. Hes kept the other car which is newer and only has 30,000 miles on. He wants to split the equity from the house 60/40 60 for him as he paid more into it as a result of being paid more over the years. I am agreeable to this although I have been told I could fight for much more. I dont have the energy and dont want to drag the process out for longer than necessary. My question is regarding submitting the financial order to the judge. I was given legal advice that stated the judge will try to make everything as fair as possible, so essentially, anything less than an equal split of the equity of the house would mean the order would be rejected by the judge and wed have to go through the process again. It was also mentioned that the fact I havent taken any furniture etc. would be taken into account. My husband seems to have been told this wont be an issue so I want to ask for an impartial opinion on this. The bottom line is that I am fine with 40 as I want this process over as quickly as possible, but I was also told the judge would be unlikely to care about my acceptance of the terms. Thanks in advance for any help. Location: London, UK",
