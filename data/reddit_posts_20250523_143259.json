    "text": "I kept telling myself I was faking it so I never got help. I was neglected and abused heavily as a child my dad worked from sun up until sun down and my mom was always passed out on the couch from substance abuse. From ages 4-6, I was lonely, by myself all day, no money to pay for cable or toys, we often didnt have electricity. I loved drawing but it wasnt something that i could do all day everyday. Most of the time, I would just sit in my room and zone out for hours and hours, staring into space using my imagination, dreaming up elaborate stories, characters, and fictional worlds. Even when I started kindergarten/preschool, I would want to get home so I could just daydream and exist in a world better than my own. I didnt have any friends, so I started playing pretend with the characters I wrote, talking back and forth to them in my head, they were my imaginary friends, just like a lot of kids had. I would just sort of roleplay with myself, either talking to them, or pretending to be them entirely, most of them were my own original stories and characters, but sometimes were characters from books or DS games I liked. This was my only comfort, and over time it started becoming just second nature to have full on conversations in my head with my imaginary friends, I stopped having to think about how they would respond within a couple months of doing this. My parents divorced around age 7 once my brother was born, and my mom got custody because of the broken fucking legal system. She immidietly moved in with a new boyfriend, he started abusing me emotionally, physically, and sexually . My brother was also neglected during that time so I took a parent like role in his life from the beginning. I was miserable, and I noticed that around my baby brother, I would feel completely and totally removed from the pain and sadness, almost like it didnt effect me at all. I wrote that off as you gotta do what you need to do when your family needs you type of feeling pretty much my whole life until my friend recently told me it could be related to what im experiencing in my mind Ill get to that. There was a lot of times like that, when fear would come and go, and honestly most of my emotions and experiences had periods of coming and going. Sometimes the emotions towards a situation, or just my opinion would flip-flop throughout the day. At this time, the voices became a lot more clearly distinct and involuntary. I didnt actually hear them with my ears but it was like I was telepathically having a conversation with someone else, or multiple other people. It was my comfort, they gave me advice that I NEVER would have thought of on my own. Some of them would take parental roles and other ones would just be there to have fun with and keep my mind busy. It was just voices at this time, like my internal dialougue, the same one that everyone has, was just a little more imaginative and fun than other peoples. Thats what I always told myself. I sort of just figured i had somehow accidentally trained my brain to think and function like that. Throughout my childhood years, things got worse, my mom had 2 twin girls who were my whole world but they barely made it past the first year of life. CPS did nothing and my abuse got worse. During his attacks, I would zone off, sometimes just focusing on talking to them in my head, and sometimes I would feel disconnected from it, like my body was there, but my mind was completely absent. I remembered what happened but it felt like... just the information of it, like I watched a movie about it but didnt actually experience it for myself. I would actually purposefully put my mind into the headspace of a character who would enjoy whatever was happening. It wasnt automatic, it was more of a conscious headspace that I was fully immersed in, like how a skilled actor can fully put themsleves into character. Overtime, just like the mind conversation, this also became just a thing that I did subconsciously and those two things started to bleed together into the same phenomenon. Once I hit puberty, also the time that I got out of my situation, it sort of had a developmental leap as I started actually learning how to navigate the real world away from all that crazy danger and panic. I no longer had to actually see, or write, the characters, they would just sort of slowly form over time on their own, eventually having a name, life, and personality that I did not create. Often times they were side characters of the ones I had known for a while, like a wife of one of my father figures who would just pop in as her own person that I didnt take the time to consciously create. Most of them I never got into the headspace of at first, it was just them in my head, but over time it would start happening. Im 22 now, and I never grew out of it even though my trauma happened over 10 years ago, I have real friends, and a job. Its always been so normal and natural to me that I just always thought of it as a unique thing about my brain because of my ADHD and Autism. It mostly didnt interfere with my life, as they all got along and honestly it still did give me catharsis as a coping mechanism. Most if the old ones from early childhood sort of phased out, but occasionally I do feel one or two of them for a brief period. Its usually 4-5 at any given time, and they come in phases, almost like a rotating menu idk how else to describe it New ones still do form, but when big changes happen it usually cycles back ones that Ive seen before. They feel like friends, despite some of my current ones having vastly different opinions on things than I do. We all have different feelings, but one body, which can get really really confusing. For example if one of them had a crush, we only have one heart, so its going to beat faster, and we only have one tummy, so its going to feel butterflies. I would still feel it even if it wasnt mine, and often times its lead me into thinking I feel a certain way about something when I dont and it was actually one of them. Healthy relationships are almost impossible because we all have different sexualities and types. Its difficult to tell what emotional sensation is coming from who. I never have amnesia, or am completely gone, I always feel like I can forcefully snap out of it if I really to, but it does take a minute and can look really awkward and quiet for a moment to another person if im having a conversation, but overall Ive learned to mask it well so no one in my life really knows. Over the years Ive brought it up to close friends, but never really went in depth about my experiences. I told an old therapist and she told me it sounded like BPD and honestly i barely even touched on it. Its just becoming a lot, I keep getting myself into bad situations because we can never agree on how I feel about people and its made relationships and friendshsps so hard. I dont even know what my Sexuality is because I WANT to be with a guy, I want to have a traditional family that I never got to have. But im just not attracted physically to guys. I can fall in love with guys but I feel no desire to do anything beyond kissing, its all pure romantic feelings with no physical attraction. Girls are mainly the opposite. I can have a deep platonic love for a woman, and be physically attracted to her, but its hard to picture myself actually having a wife and being in love with another woman. But some of us feel differently. Sometimes we feel like a lesbian, sometimes like a gay man???, sometimes a perfectly typical straight girl... its so hard. Its so hard to fall in love but then the next day feel like im grossed out by them. Its mainly just me who has that problem, because no matter who elses headspace is doing the autopilot for me, im still here in some capacity, and need to be somewhat present even if im less present than one of them. I Feel like a ringleader in that way. Life is so hard to navigate when I dont know what I have or who I truly am. I dont think i have DID, I dont fit the criteria because I dont have amnesia or feel completely out of my own body. But it feels deeper and more personal than schizophrenia. I feel like they also exist with me in my whole body, not just my thoughts. We Share feelings and a lot more. A big piece of me also feels like Im faking it somehow. This all happened because I literally used to do it on purpose as a child. I used to play pretend. What if I just never stopped playing pretend? I feel like im just doing this for fun, but I cant turn it off. Ive done it for so many years this is just who I am. But life would also feel so dull without it, its all Ive ever know. I looked into maladaptive daydreaming, and I think for sure it started out like that, but grew into something else. Because I do actually maladaptive daydream still, and it feels a lot different than this. That just feels like me having fun as myself., same as when I make a character for a DD campaign, im aware that im role-playing. But when they front, they can also roleplay and do those same activities and for them its just the same, them doing it for fun while still being themsleves. Because I still have doubts about if Im actually part of the community or not, j feel bad using DID terms and languages because I dont want to appropriate or use psychological terms not intended for me as to not disrespect the people who actually struggle with and have been diagnosed with the disorder. I dont have the money to get diagnosed. And I also dont have health insurance to see a therapist.. i would just really appreciate any free or discounted Therapy resources or places I can be free to learn about what I have and educate myself on who we are. Im just so confused and finally after years of keeping it away from friends and family im ready to get help and learn. Idek what exactly it is that im looking for rn, just a direction and a community i suppose. People to learn from. Any general advice for my situation is appreciated. I just have zero direction rn about where to go if I want help for learning to manage my life like this. Im also so so sorry for this wall of text, i spent two hours try to compartmentalize everything into words TLDR: I have a cast of characters in my head and no idea what condition im living with, dont have the money or confidence to get help for it.",

    "title": "USA KY: Employer forced ADA paperwork while I was on PTO for a mental health crisis. What are my options now?",
    "text": "Location: Kentucky, USA Hi everyone, Im trying to figure out my legal position before taking any further steps with my employer. Im in the middle of what feels like a serious ADA and PTO rights issue, and Id appreciate advice on what to do next, whether thats negotiating severance, consulting a lawyer, or filing a complaint. Key facts: Im a full-time, salaried employee at a small company. Upon hire, I disclosed that I have fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition that impacts my physical stamina and is closely tied to my mental health. Two weeks ago, I requested to use earned PTO to deal with an acute mental health crisis tied to my condition. I did not request accommodations, just PTO. One business day prior, I had my 90-day performance review, which was very positive and acknowledged my leadership, consistency, and contributions. During that review, I also requested a raise, which was declined. The next workday, I was told the company was initiating an ADA process, stating that my attendance created performance concerns and giving me 72 hours to submit medical documentation or face potential consequences. I clarified in writing that I had not requested accommodation and was only seeking PTO, but they proceeded with the process anyway while I was actively in crisis. I submitted the documentation, which confirmed a qualifying ADA condition and recommended schedule flexibility, but included no fixed return-to-work date pending reevaluation. Shortly after that, they emailed me assuming Id be returning to work the following Tuesday even though my provider had not cleared me to return and hadnt given a date. This entire process took place during what was supposed to be protected PTO for recovery. The sudden escalation, timing after my raise request, and pressure to produce ADA documentation have made me feel unsafe and distrustful of returning to work. I havent sent anything formal yet, but Im considering emailing HR and the CEO, who is looped in to request a severance discussion. I want to make it very clear that I am not resigning just seeking an appropriate resolution. My questions: 1. Was it legal for them to initiate the ADA process and demand medical documentation during PTO, even though I hadnt requested accommodation? 2. Could this be viewed as ADA retaliation or interference, especially given the raise denial and immediate escalation the next day? 3. Does the fact that I disclosed fibromyalgia at hire give me stronger legal standing here? 4. If I want to pursue severance quietly, should I make the request now or talk to a lawyer first? 5. Should I wait and see how they respond, or preemptively file with the EEOC to preserve my rights? Ive saved all emails, messages, and documents related to this. Ive complied with every request, and yet I feel like Ive been punished for disclosing my condition and asking for support. Thanks in advanceI just want to move forward the right way and protect myself.",

I was completely shocked to hear this. How legal is this? This feels like a total breach of privacy, and luckily in this scenario I wasnt fired before I got the job.

The Cambridge series for any given topic is one of my favorites to read, even though theyre made up by numerous contributors.

    "text": "I 24F have been dating my boyfriend 23M for about 2.5 years now and were in a good relationship overall and have never had any serious fights. Today while looking for a recipe on his phone I came across a chat with his female roommate 24F and in their conversation wthere was a casual mention about my boyfriend jerking off to an old mathematics tutor on YouTube. When I asked him about it he told me that his roommates kept ringing his bell one day while he was jerking off and out of frustration, he yelled at them to give him a moment as he was jerking off. Im not upset about what he was doing but it does kinda feels strange to me that he was so casual about sharing something which is so personal with a female roommate. I can never imagine sharing this with anyone let alone a male friend. This has made me uncomfortable and iam also aware that it is not my body nor my personal details which he sharing and i feel its unfair that i have these feelings about a body which is not mine. Iam not sure if I should bring this up again or let it go away? How do you approach conversations about personal boundaries when it involves things like this? Thank you for all the advices in advance 3bf 23M casually told female roommate 24f that he is jerking off and iam unsure of how to feel about it",

    "text": "Location: Georgia Maintenance locked our bedroom doors without permission and now the apartment complex is charging a 75 unlock fee is this legal? Hi, I am hoping someone can help clarify this. I moved out of my apartment in Georgia and left my bedroom door unlocked on purpose so my subleasers could access it. A few days later, my roommate called maintenance for an unrelated issue. Maintenance came while no one was home and, for some reason, locked all of our bedroom doors, even though we didnt ask them to. Now, the apartment complex is demanding a 75 fee to unlock my room. I never requested the door to be locked, and it wasnt locked when I left. Trying to talk to my apartment has not resulted in anything. Is it legal for them to lock tenants out of their own rooms without permission? Can they charge an unlock fee when theyre the ones who locked it in the first place?",

    "text": "Location: Montana 28yo male here, I have not been myself lately. I have been dealing with some things mentally, and have been way over my head. I have been so overloaded withs stress that I missed when my Wife, 30yo, left. Last time I saw her was 3 days ago, but the strange thing is all her belongings are still here in my home. I looked on my card statements and saw she charged my card to buy a train ticket into Idaho. I think something strange is going on, and want to report her missing. But I fear that lots of suspicion will be put onto me, as the husband. Especially because as I said I have been going through some mental stuff, got fired from my job, etc. What do I do? Should I report her missing, or just accept that she left on her own accord?",
