He was definitely the avoidant type and said he didnt want a commitment and didnt love me. I finally had enough and told him to fucker off. Ive since gotten married and have a great partner. This guy just reached out to me on instagram after no contact for five years! We do not follow each other so he had to do a search for me. He apologized for making me feel bad, told me I deserved better, he valued our friendship and that he holds me in high regard and wants to keep in touch. The kicker is he is married too and had a 4 month old baby! I know I shouldnt care but Why? Why after five years and having a wife and kid did he reach out? Why?",

    "text": "Location: Pennsylvania Hi long time lurker, first time poster Hello, Im a bartender with alcoholism and bipolar disorder. This is widely known at my job. I used to have private text message conversations with my bar manager about work and personal matters. One bad couple of weeks, I was off my medication. I texted him a bunch of stuff I prefer to not see the light of day. Although any time this happened, he knew and I told him to just ignore me, which he did. However, he left his phone on the bar one day and another bartender went into his phone to look for our text thread, she then showed this text thread to our boss. I did admittedly quit in that thread, but always showed up to work the next day. The owners are my friends, which caused our relationship to deteriorate, my hours were cut significantly on rehire, and I got moved to a slower location while she stayed and made what I should have been making. Ive also started drinking again, crying everyday, had my reputation amongst coworkers deteriorate and all my regulars think Ive gone crazy. So I know she was also telling everyone my business. I already told a law firm they can take all awarded damages. Is there any grounds for defamation or am I just fucked?",

    "title": "F29 and m29 toxic relationship. Female perspective",
    "text": "F 29 and M26 started the relationship 3 years ago. It started as hooking up and gradually got into something more serious. He would always tell me that he liked me a lot and when I asked if he wanted anything more. Hed tell me that down the road he does but not right now. So I didnt push. The only times I pushed was when I asked to drive me five miles down the road to pick up a bed from Facebook marketplace. He had made a huge deal and complained the whole time. Not that long after, he helped a stranger move and then contracted a fucking std from her. My dumbass went to the hospital with him and held his stupid hand in the car. Because we werent together even though I wanted to be and he treated me like it and spent most of the week. And ate my food and had sex pretty much whenever he wanted. He got head a lot. But like I was in too deep and I have ocd mixed in with adhd and sometimes I be blind to stuff. I honestly just saw him hurting and wanted to help fix it. I slowly cut off the people he didnt like in my life. I didnt even realize it. He never talked about why I cut them off either. He just went on about what he didnt like about them. I leaned on him more. he would call me a cunt, a whore, dumbass, fatass, kid, literally anything he felt like. I begged for him to stop. He didnt until I said I would post screenshots. Then I was shady for blackmailing him and he didnt trust me. Funny thing was that I never said I never trusted him after getting the std. he really just needed to stop calling me names. he love bombed me. SPOILER ALERT i fall for it a lot. Since I started threatening to post his mean ass comments, things started to escalate. My things were getting broken. I was replacing them. He broke my daughters bedroom window for a towel. The window is still broken. I think I broke his protein jar when I threw it out the house and his beaded lanyard when I was trying to get my key off. Thats it. He caused so much damage to me and my home. Its ridiculous. He started leaving bruises on my wrists, on my arms. ALSO prior to this, I was diagnosed with ptsd . So thats was cool to be later sprinkled in the other two. I havent ever been medicated for anything until just recently. At this point, my body was fucking exhausted. Its like I needed to be him to be okay because I felt helpless and ugly without him. Like no one would want me besides him. I stayed. At the start of this school year, we had gotten into a really bad fight. On the drive, I didnt realize that being in tight spaces with him made me anxious. I just know that I loved him and I hyper focused on that and ignored everything else. So I was on edge without even realizing. I started an argument or snapped at him without realizing it. I did not mean to. It turned into an argument and I fight or flight response kicked in. So I got out of the car. We were two hours in the trip at this point and I had to leave. I couldnt breathe. I couldnt think. I got out of the car and left. I got a ride to the gas station. I was honestly so disappointed in myself to get a ride with a stranger but thats the point that I was at. I needed to leave and I didnt care how. Because it was a guy I got a ride with, I was now a whore. A slut. I was getting ready to hurt myself but I couldnt not escape his voice or that feeling. The ride back home was rough. He made me apologize but continued to call me a whore from then on for months. I paid for 90 of our relationship. Should have been one of the biggest red flags. Anyways a month after that, we were trying another car ride, even though we never addressed the last issue because I should be over the name calling, bruises and still telling me every once in a while I never wanted you and I should quit being a kid. We got into another argument. I again hopped out. I am exhausted. I dont want to keep living life. Im dramatic. Again mixed in with ocd, so like his comments about my body and any part of me are repeated over and over again in my mind. And I just want him to think differently of me but I cant help but to react. This is fucking long. Im sorry if you read this. He almost drove me yo. We got him from that ride, he slammed my head against the corner of the bed and threw my phone at my face when I tried to call 911. He broke my nose with my phone. The audacity. Guess what towel he used?!? The one he broke into my house for. Guess who cleaned the blood off?!? I did. lol. I started work a liar because he didnt give me a broken nose and couple of black eyes. I some hospitals bills for that but he says thats my problem . Omg so long. He left me to heal by myself for two weeks. Two months later I got into a car accident. I got rear ended. One week later, he threw his whole body weight on the side that hurt and kept pushing down with his whole body. That was painful. He ripped off my bra. He left me there crying. He came back after I felt a little better and all the bruises healed. He told me I didnt deserve flowers. We broke up a few months later. We work 30ft apart since the start of the school. I lost 40 lbs since the start of the school year but just recently 20 because I get anxiety and hes so nice in public. Recap: I have ocd, ptsd, both forms of ADHD I was referred to specialist about an autism diagnoses but never went. I know for a fact that those played a huge part and still continue to play a huge part because I cant forget about him, hes there whenever I got to work.",
