    "text": "I have severe dental issues, I was recommend a dentist, even though his yelp reviews werent that great, I still went in for a checkup and got a price that described what id pay for each tooth. it was reasonable I have a good idea what root canals and implants should cost. I said ok! lets gets started. right away things got tricky, this office manager goes: well if you dont have the full amount its an extra 3000 and ill need half now, half when we reach the halfway point I should of known there... I didnt have the full amount, However I accepted plan B, and paid her, we got off to a great start, alot of work was getting done and 1 single month into, it this lady goes: We are halfway done!!! pay up! and I did, I FFFed up. from that point on they were only giving me appointments A month apart even though Ive had this one tooth that started off as a cavity and is now in my opinion unsalable meaning it probably needs an implant, it could have been root canal-ed before,however the office has been dragging thier feet since they got paid in full. last august I called them because they fell out of touch and the employee that answered told me that my work was already completely finished!! he was nasty about it too.. they still owed me 4 implants and that root canal i mentioned. I got in touch with this office manager a few months later and finally they started working on my mouth again aprrox last December, they placed 2 implants. come January I find out that this office manager clears out my Aetna dental account, I was already 100 paid in full, after dragging their feet from May till January and I still needed 4 implants to be finished and 1 root canal. to add insult, march 2025 I had a cap fall off an old tooth, they tell me the tooth cant be saved, you need an implant, I say well I have 1500 out of network great insurance for this year, well that money, as said was already stolen by her so she hit me with oh they sent the money already, do you wanna pay now? she wanted me to charge the total amount for the tooth implant and was ignoring that she ripped off my dental insurance for the year already. Im glad I said no I have to look into this. unfortunately everything didnt hit me until after I left but by then they already extracted the tooth, im locked into the implant now, i bet it could have been saved, they wanted to charge me all the money they could atm. I reported them to the state its been 2months now and I dont think they are going to do shit. I emailed the lady handling my case told her that the dental office arent responding to a mail/ written request I made to find out what implants I have in my mouth so I can have a new dentist finish the work, i dont feel comfortable returning to this place for many reasons if you reading can understand? The state hasnt done a thing yet. I dont know what to do this is fucking me up Ive spent a ton of money.",

He has recently openly admitted to purposely manipulating me, threatened violence many times, physically harmed me and my pets. Threatened to kill me once. He is a diagnosed sociopath. I have a history of mental illness - self harm and suicide. I was still in contact with him and was experiencing a mental health crisis. He texted this: Outside of the cutting part. Thats weak. When you do. Make sure you are considerate where you do it. Thats not an easy clean up. 2 hours later: Are you ok? If youd like to talk. I would like too. I have cut off all contact as much as possible. I am in a mental health crisis and seeking help. What are my rights in this situation? Im afraid to start a restraining order. I cannot see him in person ever again - I dont know if a protective order requires both sides to be in the same court. Im afraid to start any action against him because Im afraid of anything that will set him off. He is an alcoholic and very dangerous. I do not know what to do right now. In the right setting, he could attempt harm against me or my family. I dont know if he has my parents address but he could find it online. Location: Indiana",

The only problem being it be like two opposite corners of the country so its really far apart. We have known each other for almost 2 years but recently she started ignoring me and I confronted her she said its cause she was hitting 27 next month and was thinking about the future and how she is at an age to get married and she might get married in 1-2 years. She brought our age into question, our parents might not end up agreeing and there is also how religion could be an issue. I love her and I dont see issues here except for education as I am not done yet but I have been working and if marriage were to be brought up I will be able to take care of us. She is a doctor and I havent done my masters yet. I dont think I can live my life without her moving forward like I have through a lot and she is the first relationship I have had but I also know I dont want nobody but her. Its really late at night for me atm so I cant type properly but I will edit in or add in the comments if I have more to add But do you think we should just end it off here. She suggested us just being friends but I dont want that To add to this I also suggested we meet up somewhere soon or put out an idea where we could move in somewhere while she works and I study and work. Do you think this is a good idea",

    "text": "Since we started dating, she had this friend group that didnt hang out much but would call almost every single day to play, which I found a bit awkward bc shell spend more time with them and barely answering my texts but never complained and let her know that I would like to get to know who these people actually were bc I only knew them by what she tells me. But it happened that, around the time we had our firsts months of dating, I was meeting new ppl I was starting uni as well and making a few friends that I, some time after, introduced to her. And everything was fine, until her friend group wanted to make a little band for a one time concert and she decided to invite one of my friends that played the guitar without me knowing,, and I couldnt help but get mad at her bc I found out that she invited him the same day they were ab to start practicing together, and not even that but was introducing HIM to her group before introducing ME??? So ofc we discussed ab it, and I cant rlly remember what happened after that but I let it pass,, or so I thought. A few months ago we had the same discussion bc I felt left out by her hanging out w her friends and inviting me to barely anything, when every time I had plans my friends were already considering her on them. And since our first discussion Ive been very clear that I just want reciprocity from her, shes part of everything that I do, why cant I get the same treatment that I give? But what happened after? I tried to stop inviting her to things which I still cant stop, and everything stayed the same. And my other problem that I cant bring myself to tell her is that, this year she started a new friend group with ppl she met on uni, and thats ok bc she has to ofc,, but keeps telling me ab them, the things they do, how they are, and one of those things is that they bring alcohol to class already two times this week as far as I know and that some of them smoke a lot,, like chain smoking type. And idk if Im just worried ab what could these people get her into, cus Im okay if she gets drunk once or twice or smokes on hangouts, but I dont want her to become addicted to that,, or if Im also jealous that shes going out with even more people that I dont actually know. I want to keep clear that I 100 respect her space, but how she acts ab it is like she just doesnt want me around her social circle at all and the few times she actually invited me felt like she just did it out of chore instead of wanting to : I dont want to keep discussing about this bc its the same discussion we always have, and every time I try to solve things she treats me like garbage and I end up apologizing for making her feel bad and all... And I just want a solution on how to handle this, Ill appreciate any opinion or advice. Ive been keeping myself away from relationships until she confessed to me bc I know she is the one I wanna spend my life with. I dont want to end things.",

    "text": "First, I hate Capital One. I was a member of Discover since my first year of college... many, many moons ago. During the credit crunch of 2005?, I was running a balance on my Capital One card. No one has to scold me, I was in a situation and I had to do it. I was well under my 30 utilization on the card. Then, Capital One, took every penny that was left of my credit, leaving me with the balance... and cranked my utilization up to 100! I contacted customer service and they didnt care one bit. I paid down my balance and three months later, they completely canceled the card. I had a very small credit limit on the Discover, so my utilization was like 80, overall. I dont want my Discover card any more, but I know I cant cancel it because I only have two credit cards. My Discover card credit limit is over 10,000 now and my second card is 2,300. I never asked for a credit limit increase because I figured I had enough of one on the Discover. I would appreciate any suggestions. Im thinking of putting a small revolving charge on the Discover so they cant cancel it hopefully. My credit score is above 800, so getting a new card would be no problem... but I really dont want a third card. I dont even think there are any more good credit companies nowadays, are there? Any positive feedback is much appreciated. I will check back later, thank you.",

So theres this girl I met at an old job. I was fairly new at the time and she was showing me how to stock a certain shelf. I found her attractive, but told myself not to catch feelings as this girl was just being nice and coaching me. However, after showing me how to stock the shelves we started talking about other things. Its important to note that at this point in my life i was going through some traumatic shit and had cut myself off socialy for a couple of years at this point. I became socially awkward and had a hard time opening up to people. So when I found myself being able to talk to her and being my old talkative and goofy self, it was like a sudden rebirth. Hadnt felt that way in a long time. On my lunch break or before starting my shift shed come and sit with me, which was something not many people would do and wed talk about games, college classes and other things. One thing we bonded over in particular was One Piece which I hadnt really watched until she really really wanted me to watch it. It took me 2 years to catch up to the current arc at the time around ep 600 or so and i remember how excited she was to talk about the current arcs I was on. Meanwhile the entire time I was trying my damned hardest not to develop feelings for her. However eventually I began to accept the fact that I wanted her to be more than just a friend. The main problem was the fact that she had a bf. Though she had a bf, its believed that they were having issues. So pathetically I sat there and waited for them to break up before asking her out something in which I regret to this day. There were other girls who also gave me attention and some of which made it obvious that they liked me. However I never went after these girls because the main girl was who I truly wanted to be with. The more we were latched together the more Id want to be with this girl and would dream of a life with her. One time she came to work with her bf and they came to my lane I was a cashier and she was very exited to see me. Id say more so than usual. I flirted with her a little bit and joked with her and she went along with it. Id look at her bf from time to time and he would glare at me and stayed relatively quiet. As if to say he knew what I was doing. After this interaction I decided to ask her to hangout. However, right when I was about to finally ask her out, she started to become reserved and didnt really interact with me as much. Come to find out she caught her bf in the act of cheating and they broke up. I tried to give her space as she wasnt her usual self. A couple weeks later she quits and gets a job at a grocery store. She tried to get me to work with her at her new job, but I was young and new to working, so I felt anxious about moving jobs and declined her offer. After that we stopped talking all together and shed come visit the store from time to time. Each time she came, she became less and less interested in talking to me and it got to a point where Id ask her how she had been and shed straight up ignore me. It used to confuse the hell out of me and I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt but she continued to be cold towards me. A year goes by and I wind up getting fired for some stupid shit and I get a new job at a hardware store. Couple months in Im enjoying it and wanted to tell someone. I go on FB and I get a notification about her story she posted. I hit her up on messenger, ask how shes been and everything seemed decently well. It was as if we went back to being friends. After that wed text each other every now and then, but in the summer of 2019 I was going through some shit and had a phase of paranoia. During this phase I essentially cut everyone off, including her. Fast forward a couple years, and my paranoia had subsided and im doing a bit better mentally. So I hit her up again. However this time her replies are short and she comes off a bit cold. For example, she tells me she was having issues with a lady spreading false rumors at her job and I said something along the lines of what are these rumors about? and she goes you dont need to know that. So then I change the subject. On top of this shes taking a day to reply. On one occasion taking a whole week. I thought she straight up ghosted me, but she replies a week later talking about she was sick and didnt mean to ignore me. After that I get the sense that Im annoying her and she doesnt want anything to do with me, so I leave her alone. A part from the short replies and waiting a day for a reply I notice on her fb page, ig, and Snapchat shes been creating stories with a guy. Talking about how in love she is with him and how shes glad to have someone like him by her side. At that point I got the picture and the reason for her late responses and short replies was because of her guy. Fast forward a year and I try contacting her on messenger and im getting no reply. Would try to say hey or how you been and would get nothing. Needless to say between the new bf and the no replies, Im hurting. After a couple months I decide to leave her be and let her live her life. Was hoping we could at least be freinds, but im just a stranger at this point. Fast forward a couple more years and Im under the impression that ive moved on and im talking to another girl. I recently moved and for whatever reason im reminded of her. I look at my snap notifications and I notice shes playing rivals. She posted some of her highlights and shes a pretty decent dps, so I wanted to see if she would duo queue with me. Hoping that shed at least reply on Snapchat. I messege her and believe it or not she replies. So I start off by asking how shes been and blah blah blah, whatever. Her answers are short and cold again. Ask if she still works overnights and then makes it known that she does infant still works overnight. Not only that she does with her bf. To add more salt to the wound that they also live together! As yoh could imagine hearing this hurt quite a lot. I didnt respond to her until the next day skipping the small talk and straight talking about rivals. She confirms she does infact play rivals. I was gonna ask her if she was down to duo queue, but she tells me to talk to her on fb messenger because she doesnt like to talk on Snapchat. So I did and got no response. Tried talking to her on snap a few days later and got ghosted. Ive since left her alone as its quite clear she wants nothing to do with me. Since this incident Ive gone back to being depressed. Im dissapointed with myself because I knew she gives zero fucks about me and that the person I know her as, is the person she was 10 years ago. Today shes a completely different person, planning a life with this guy. Admittedly, I do still have some feelings for her. However, I valued our friendship over everything else and I considered her a really good friend. She was unknowingly there for me at a time where I was in a really dark place. I contemplated ending my life on more than one occasion and had she not been there, God knows what wouldve happened to me. As I explained before I thought I had moved on, but old feelings have comeback to haunt me yet again. I simply wished she told me to fuck off or just blocked me all together. I just want to know if she had feelings about me way back when and to let her know how important our friendship was. She simply wont give me a chance to come out and say it. I also dont want to harass or bother her trying to find out. Its been almost a month since I reached out to her and Ive been in my feelings since. Been contemplating sending her a message explaining everything, but I already feel pathetic as it is. I just want to know if she ever had feelings for me. If she reads my message and calls me a fucking loser thats better than not hearing her say it all.",

    "text": "TW: Long Rant, may be self deprecating TLDR: I think I lost a job I received an offer for, because I had an emergency that wouldve delayed my start date by 1 week. Hi, I know Im in the wrong most likely. I just wanted to rant. I have been searching for work after being laid off. Finally, got an offer for a job that I was a little excited about even though itd pay me 3 less and I felt like Id be doing more work with that pay decrease, but Im desperate as I only have 5 weeks of unemployment left. Interviewed, got the job, went through the onboarding process, drug screen etc. Thursday this week was quite hectic for me. A family member of mine had a family emergency, and while hearing about whats going on for the first time I get a call from my recruiter telling me my drug screen results came back and asked if I could start the very next dayFriday/today. I stupidly told them I wouldnt be able to and could start next week, but didnt tell them why. And this is my problem. I have been working in corporate america for about 5 years now and I cant take it anymore. I think I may be an undiagnosed autistic because I just feel like I miss so many social cues mainly while working. Corporate America has a way of communicating vaguely, so you have to be prepared to constantly read inbetween the lines, and in some cases misread inbetween the lines. I have been advised by many to not volunteer information as it can backfire on me later. Which, yes, I guess leads to being or coming off as deceptive. I believed the advice I was given and felt I shouldnt divulge details of my family emergency to a new job so soon out of fear they would not believe me and would think Im shady, deceptive, unreliable, etc. Back to the story, during this onboarding process I was led to believe that since my drug screen was taking longer than usual to come back, they may have to move me to a June start date. So hearing this, I am under the impression that there is a possibility of being able to start in June instead which was perfect. I could handle my family emergency this weekend, and then get back and take the next couple of weeks to prepare for my new job. Got a call this morning that all of a sudden the job will not allow me to start in June. Im not sure if the offer is completely rescinded, as it has not shown as such in the job portal, and they discussed possibilities of me starting in June, but they are now unsure if I can start in June. And maybe, I can start in July but theyre also not sure about that either and even if there is a July start date, by that point I will have to reapply etc. They also noted that they felt as though I was trying to hide the fact that I had a medical marijuana card, when I was not. I happily took the drug test with no issue, checked in on updates for the screening results, and assured them I am not on any illegal substances during my interview, etc. and I thought that just giving them the information of my medical card with the results would be okay, and standard protocol since I have done the same for previous jobs in the past. To my understanding, I did not have to provide this info until after the test results were complete since this is a medical prescription. I just feel so stupid, worthless, and misled. I have NOT had a good working experience the past few years and I am so exhausted. First, I enter adulthood and the job market in 2020 where I basically had to do side hustles for 3 years to survive. I then got a job that I loved and felt was perfect, until we got a new supervisor who was racist and probably a bit ageist too I was a 23 year old who worked with 40 year olds. She tried to wrongfully terminate me, but since I was a union employee and had a clean professional record with the company, she couldnt. Her bosses completely shut her down. After that incident I decided to find a new job which hired me and then laid me off after 6 months because they decided to go in a different direction. There were no warnings, I just got a new report that I was responsible for, and was praised by my direct supervisor. Since then I have been unemployed. I feel like a moron. I probably shouldve jumped up, halted my family emergency, and made sure I was in office, mug in hand, ready to work this morning but I thought I would have to drive 3 states away to help my sibling during a family emergency today and wouldnt be back until Wednesday. When I was in the middle of the call that I may have to help my family 3 states away, I got the call from my recruiter for this job, asking if I could come in the very next morning. I profusely apologized and let them know that something has come up that I am trying to figure out right now but if possible I may need to accept the June start date that you mentioned. I feel like a clown. I feel stupid. And I feel exhausted. Im not even sure now if I completely lost this job as they keep just telling me that Theres a possibility you can start in June, but were also doubtful. I guess they wanted people who could start immediately instead of waiting 1-2 weeks to start. I know Im in the wrong, I had an emergency come up at the worst time and maybe I shouldve told them about my medical history but now Im back to scrolling indeed and convincing myself the job posting Im reading doesnt sound too bad. I hate myself and I dont know how much longer I can do this. And even when I get the opportunity to do this again Im back to being a wage slave who is spending all of their time making someone rich as I download personal loan apps to see if I can get a 50 advance on my paycheck. I cant believe this is the life Im expected to be grateful for. Im open to any advice anyone may have. Thank you",

    "text": "I recently met a new hire at my workplace during an introductory meeting. Something about the interaction felt off, so I decided to do some research on them. I came across troubling informationabout 18 years ago, when this person was in their 20s, they were reportedly arrested in connection with a case involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old boy. Both individuals were part of the same religious community. It appears the case was dropped two weeks before trial when the child and their family chose not to press charges. I couldnt find details about a conviction, but the individual may have spent some time in jail. Additionally, a few years ago, a law firm brought forward a case alleging widespread abuse cover-ups within that same religious community, and this persons name came up in that context as well. Again, I dont know the outcome of that situation. Now, with workplace events like BBQs and family-friendly gatherings where kids are present, Ive decided not to bring my own family. Im not comfortable having my children around this individual. That said, Im genuinely torn. On one hand, no conviction was made, and people can change. On the other, Id feel devastated if something ever happened and I had kept quiet. Im looking for honest perspectiveswhat would you do in a situation like this?",

Under her breath whilst slightly giggling i didnt say anything but it was bizarre to me as she gave me a really narky brows look at the start of this appointment which confuses me about her being like this.",

    "text": "For context: I moved to her country, i make enough doing very little and have supported us for around 1.5 yrs now. Her job makes 8.33 of what i make and she is working 6 days/wk, and is a sort of sidegrade to the work she used to have before with better advancement potential and benefits. We were dumb, we met online and fell in love quickly, 2 months after we met i told her she should quit her job and move in.....and we did. Things worked out wonderfully given our stupidity, she is an amazing person and i am blessed to have her in my life. I am an anxious person, i plan for the worst and hope for the best, I threw out the idea that earning in the currency here would be a hedge against possible problems with my currency USD, and the plan was for us to save for a business anyways. She is driven, dutiful and regardless of how i may feel about her working, i knew that she would eventually occupy her time with making money instead of chilling with me at home all day, i didnt realize how much it would suck without her. First few days were OK, but i teared up taking her to work today. She grew up very poor and the culture here is to provide for the family, she has always been the breadwinner until me. She is very frugal and i know she feels guilty though she wont say it aloud about using my income for everything....and at the same time i know how it feels to be financially dependent on another, it sucks. We spend about 60 of my income for expenses all possible expenses and overestimated and have a plan to save as much as we can. She would also hopefully have an opportunity soon enough to move abroad with me and earn triple the income she makes now. Its a messy situation. Her work would be around a 1.276x to the amount I planned to save for the emergency fund/future finances/investments, its not nothing and if the forex rate drops, it will be more, though we live below our means and would be sustainable given a big USD devaluation. I cant help to think is this worth her working 6 days/wk? .... i know its selfish, i miss her, i dont want this. Our goal of saving for college for her daughter and saving 1 years worth of expenses will come 8 months sooner, from 28 to 20 months, after which we plan to invest. Her daughter will likely have free college and that savings is just in case and would then be rolled into whatever should it not be needed. Im sorry for the rant, i just want to vent and maybe get some advice or opinions.",

    "text": "My neighbor recently broke his femur and has a new small kitten and 2 dogs. While hes been in the hospital, the dogs have been with a vet friend and I have been watching his small cat until he gets discharged from the ER. I have been checking on her multiple times a day to feed and play with her while hes gone. Today when I went to check on her, I heard he meowing loudly from outside. At first I thought she was missing interaction and wanting to see people because my cats do that when were gone for the day. However, when I opened the door she didnt run to me like she always has. Instant fear set in as I listened closer to her crys and I ran to the bedroom where her box and food are in. Immediately I saw her stuck in the box. I immediately tried to get her out but couldnt. I ran across to my apartment to grab my gf to help. We came back in and the poor baby was still screaming. The boxs sensor had either gone out or wasnt working and had decided to clean while she was in it. Her arm had gotten caught between the rolling ball part and the actual dumping area and was twisted inside. We had unplugged it and called my neighbor as we were trying to get her out. She was panting and scared. We felt a high amount of fear while trying to get her out and finally I used all my strength to force the box to move and she finally got her arm free. Immediately we saw her arm was broken at a 90 angle. Our neighbor had us take her to his vet he always uses to which they decided to board and keep her while tending and caring to her. This was the scariest thing my partner and I have ever experienced especially because we have cats. This box is only a few weeks old since he just got her and when I tried to look the box up I couldnt anywhere selling that box. I wanted to post this to raise awareness to cat owners who do have this box. My worst fear happened today after seeing all of those posts about cats being killed by their boxes and were are just so glad it wasnt more severe. The first picture is the entire box, the second one is where her arm was stuck and you can see where some fur that came off is. Just wanted to raise awareness, stay safe everyone! The box is a DOYOMI life is simple box.",

    "text": "Hello! Im 28 years old and I have around 20k euros. Ive been thinking if I should get a car or an apartment by credit. Financially speaking I know its a no brainer, but I still lean more towards the car and my arguments are the following: - I will inherit two apartments, so I wont have the problem of paying rent while retired. This was stressing me the most and was the 1 reason to pick the apartment, but thankfully I wont have this problem. - Im not bothered to move places once in a couple of years. It gives me a restart feeling even though I know its placebo. - Im not guaranteed to keep my current job forever and I dont want to get into a situation where my job is in the other part of town. - I dont want to be tied to my property. I dont rule out moving abroad someday and in my country you cant rent your apartment while still paying instalments. - It might sound superficial, but buying a car would give me some kind of satisfaction in life. One of my favorite activities is driving and yes, I know I can drive a cheaper car as well, but Im seriously fixed on a Mazda lol. - If someday I decide slim chances to get an apartment, I can sell my car. Ill lose a couple thousands because of depreciation and some couple thousands more, but its a loss I can afford and accept. These are my arguments. Strictly in my case, it seems like the car is a bad choice only by financial means. But I started from the bottom and never really spoiled myself. Now I have a chance after Ive saved money for like half my life. The reason of this post is to help me reflect more. Are there any logic errors in my arguments? Or things Ive missed and not taking into consideration? My decision is not 100 taken so please help me get more perspectives. Thank you!",

    "text": "I would like to create a thread here with the purpose of getting other peoples experiences as well as possible legal advice if something can be done. I have worked for Grubhub for about a year now, Im pretty good with probabilities, and I believe GrubHub uses psychological and manipulation tactics to keep drivers in a sorte of caste system so that they punish you for not taking orders that do not benefit the driver and even sometimes the diner who bought the food. I will provide one example here, I arrived 1 minute late to the merchant to pick up the food and my percentage of being on time dropped from 93 to 90. It takes a lot to get your percentage up and quickly it goes down if you arrive late even for one minute. I noticed this to be a pattern if you deny food orders during the day. And that doesnt seem fair and seems psychological and punishing. It gets in the way of me making the money that I should be making fair and square as they say their system is random and they have no control over it, but its not. Ill provide more examples and screenshots if this is allowed here. If other people have similar experiences of feeling punished and discriminated against, pleas share. Location: Connecticut",

    "text": "I am 19F my gf is 19F weve been together for 4 years long distance Today my gf got upset with me because i fell asleep while she was at the store. I worked from 6:45am-4 pm today and have been working full time 46 hr this week for extra money because we are planing to visit each other soon. She works full time over night at a gas station10pm-6am and i work part time at a sales job where im outdoors the entire shift. I understand that night shift is super taxing on the body so I always tell her ill never be upset with her for being tired or falling alseep. When i got off of work I called her immediately and we talked until she went to the store around 6:30pm she got back home around 7pm something and i fell asleep on her way back ard 10 minutes She had to call me twice to wake me up,i answered the 2nd call and shes yelling at me repeatedly saying something like idk why the fuck then hangs up. I text her saying im sorry then she says that shes sorry and she shouldve never called. I understand her being upset because she goes to work soon but it was only ten minutes. Weve texted now for almost two hrs and im just apologizing, since then ive gotten out of bed sat at my desk and drunk energy drinks so im not sleepy. Am i crazy for being upset, i never get mad at her for being sleepy/ falling asleep. This is also the case for many other things but i will not get into that. Yes i have thought about bringing this up with her but i know she will get upset and and say that we should just breakup because shes a terrible person etc. Please give me your thoughts.",

Iv been going to her for like 5-6 months I told her about an interview I passed by email and she made me an appointment to see her to tell her about it etc She Always seems moody and strict type tbh gives me grouchy looks often but Im always very quiet but polite I was sitting to her very left angle and I was facing her left side Anyways this one morning she was using her mouse looking at the computer not saying anything for the moment and I looked around to my left just glancing around down a long office about 5 seconds then looked further left to an angle seen a 40 ish year old attractive blonde woman in a short dress no tights etc about 20 metres away and then I looked away after less than 2 seconds then looked to facing forward again down in my advisors direction to her left side as normal as tho no one was there to look at Then Out of nothing 3-4 seconds later my advisor whilst she was looking at the computer screen scrolling with the mouse the whole time giggled under her breath glanced over at her and said you looking at her there? Under her breath whilst slightly giggling i didnt say anything but it was bizarre to me as she gave me a really narky brows look at the start of this appointment which confuses me about her being like this.",

    "text": "My husband bought a house in 2012 at 120,000 and its now worth around 350,000. He rented it out successfully and had a 3 interest on the mortgage. His parents wanted to move to the area from out of state and only had 100K to spend on a house. Unfortunately, my husband made the stupid decision to allow them to pay off the mortgage since there was 100K left on it, and to make it their home agreeing to share the equity. The house has a walkout basement and a mother-in-law suite that together rent for 2,100 a month. The yearly cost of home insurance, property taxes, and home maintenance is about 12-15K. My FIL passed away and my MIL has a caregiver and is willing to move if needed. I have a feeling that keeping the house, free and clear, is a dumb thing to do. Though we get some income from it, its not much after deducting the costs. The home is growing in value, but is not in an area with high rates of increase in property value. Obviously the first stupid decision was to let his parents pay off the mortgage instead of taking the funds and investing them, while keeping a 3 mortgage. But, now that we find ourselves in this situation... what should we do? One thought I had was to sell the house, buy my MIL a smaller place and invest the rest of the funds. Would love to hear your thoughts.",

    "text": "Okay so title basically, he can get pretty mean and degrading. Hell call me stupid, will ask if i am slow in the head, or mentally delayed etc. I have to admit that im not super smart, at least not as smart as i can be, and thats partially my own fault. I struggle with breaking patterns and bad habits, which is frustrating for both of us. So i understand that that makes him upset sometimes. Today i asked if we could call in the evening, but he said he was going out with friends. Totally fine ofc, he sends me a pic of what hes doing, i make a little joke. I then text him again at around 00:24, he responds at 01:10 with i lost my keys i just say waht the poop, how? And i make a comment about getting a carabiner so he can hang them on his belt loops. He replies please shut up stuck in city namei reply owh okay sorry, i have my notifications on if you still wanna call at 01:55. He replies cant go home, sleeping at a friends house at 02:55. I reply everything okay?? He says no. I ask what happened and he says I LOST MY KEYS i ask why hes acting like this, he didnt see that text but he called me. Its like 03:30 am atp. I asked him on the phone why he was being like that, he says he was mad and that he already told me what was wrong he lost his keys. I said idk you only told me you lost your keys, and there was a lot of time between your replies so i thought maybe something else happened. He said im not even going to reply to that says some degrading stuff, says he wont come to see me next week because he doesnt want to spend any money to meet up with me because he has to buy new keys, and that he spends too much money on our relationship. I never ask for that, any time he says lets do 50/50 i say okay and try to make it work, but then he backtracks saying haha no never mind ill just pay. he gets mad, starts saying you get that right, youre dumb if you dont. You know how much money i lose every month i say i get it, he says hes going to hang up and tells me goodnight. Not even an i love you or anything :/ idk if i actually was being dumb, but it was late and i was worried so i stayed up. I have a 10 hr shift today and i cant even fall asleep anymore, feel like shit already and my day hasnt even started yet. Did i do anything wrong here? Im kinda bad at reflecting on things Ive done so i honestly have no clue",

    "text": "Hello everyone, Im a 32-year-old male from Pakistan, and Im an atheist ex-Muslim living in a deeply religious and conservative society. In Pakistan, being openly non-religious is not just tabooit can be dangerous. Ive lived in silence all my life, hiding my beliefs out of fear of judgment, violence, or worse. I have faced emotional abuse, threats, and extreme isolation from my own family and community. Its like I have no freedom to think, speak, or live honestly. Ive seen people falsely accused of blasphemy here, and it terrifies me every day that I could be next if someone even suspects my beliefs. I cant take it anymore. I want to live somewhere I feel safe and free. I am exploring my options for seeking asylum in a country that offers protection to people like me. Can anyone advise me on the following: Which countries are more understanding toward atheist asylum seekers? What evidence or documentation should I gather now while Im still in Pakistan? Is it possible to contact any organizations or lawyers who help ex-Muslims or human rights cases? Should I try to leave the country first and then apply, or can I start the process while in Pakistan? How does UNHCR help in cases like mine, and how long does it take? This is not a scam or a joke. Im not looking for shortcutsI just want to survive, to live honestly and safely. Any advice or help from people whove been through this, or know the system, would mean everything to me. Thank you.",

    "title": "My 20f boyfriend 20m has a porn addiction and other things",
    "text": "Im bringing this here because Im at a loss of what to do because i love him so much but things that have happened in our relationship have made it so hard to stay happy and I dont know if its because of my own doing or if something is actually wrong. My 20f boyfriend 20m of almost a year have been having these same problems for a year lol and I dont know if how I feel is justified. So when we met, he was still living with his ex and her parents bc his home situation was very bad. They were together for over 2 years I think and he lived with her for about the same time. When him and I began talking which was about 2 months after they broke up. I had also left a 5 MONTH relationship about a month beforehand , he revealed odd sexual information between them that Id really rather have not had known and I cant ever forget. I also found him thirsting over women in their comments and calling them all the same compliments hed give me. I told him how I felt about seeing that, he apologized etc. Mind you he was still in contact with one of the girls like they were talking right before him and I were. We started dating about a month after talking. I asked him to remove every girl hed had romantic relations with on his socials and to delete their chats, etc. because obviously I had done the same thing and would have never wanted him to see any of that. But his ex STILL has photos of them up on social media. Literally kissing, hugging, etc. and it makes me furious. Hes very loving and sweet to me. He does anything he can to make me happy. But hes also addicted to porn. It was very bad. Im talking about searching up specific onlyfans content while we are together which made me extremely uncomfortable. I told him to please stop watching porn, he said okay! Well now were about 5 times later of him saying he will stop and of me continuously finding it. Its always been very very hard for me to be vulnerable and intimate with another person because Im very insecure and everything that happened at the beginning of our relationship and with his ex and the whole porn thing makes me feel really shitty. About 6 months into the relationship he said our sex was very bad. Basically said I wasnt into it enough but he had never given me pointers or recommendations on what to do. he just said it was very bad : So since then Ive tried to devote so much into being sexually active and whatever for him and HE STILL WATCHES PORN. I get its an addiction and I cant just expect him to quit like that but oh my god its been SO LONG. Now hes hiding that hes texting and calling his ex. While it was about something small and stupid, he still hid it from me. Its little things like this that build up and make me so depressed and unloved. I dont know why Im still stuck on things that happened a year ago and I keep thinking well. Hes with me now and he got with me because he wanted me and still wants me but its just so hard to keep my head on straight. Is there anything I can do differently? Like Ive been doing that for years but right now everything just seems to build and build and build.",

    "text": "This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. TLDR: I saw my husband whos been paralyzed for 5 years, walking on multiple occasions without him know and I dont know what to do about it So for some context but not too much, I 26F and my husband 27M, have been married for 3 years and he became paralyzed 4 years into our relationship. Our lives adjusted and we live a happy life now with me working and him on disability. Fast forward/backwards to last year, I was talking to my husband through the bathroom door and I didnt realize that you could see through the crack in the door just at the right angle. I didnt mean to do this, but as I got close to the door so he could here me I look through and saw him walking hes a paraplegic, his legs dont have any function to my knowledge. This shook me to my core because for 5 years he has, to my knowledge and everyone elses, been paralyzed to doctors, the government, family, and friends. He was in the hospital after the accident and came out of it in a wheelchair. Hes showed me his X-rays/MRIs, how is this possible. I know this is questionable but to make sure I check on a few more occasions and saw him walking in the bathroom. He never lets me go to his appointments with him, which could be a normal thing but how the hell does anyone explain me witnessing him walking on multiple occasions? Its tearing me apart, I dont know what to do because if I bring it up to him itll probably ruin our relationship. Ive caught him lying about little medical things since then and it always brings this topic back into my head. I help him so much with everything because he cant walk, I drive him places, I pay for more than my share, I help boost and ambulate him. What if Im wrong, how could that be? I dont know what to do and its killing me.",

So I 15M am with my girlfriend 16f. We have been together for a while now, and one of our main issues is clothing. I have never been a fan of my partners wearing clothing that shows off cleavage, even if its just the two of us in private. I have expressed my discomfort with her clothing choices, and today she lashes out at me calling me sexist and saying Im just using her to make babies and to have someone take care of the house. I tried to explain that I know what teenage boys are like, being one myself, and thats the reason why Im uncomfortable. When I explained this fact, she dismissed it and called me sexist and that Im overreacting. Any advice?",

    "text": "My partners grandparents, whom he hadnt seen in six months, came to the US after 11 years to see our new apartment and celebrate his birthday. Knowing this, I planned activities, including a restaurant visit. His mother stayed the night prior and drove to pick them up from the airport. She called to say they were an hour away. Initially, my partner suggested I meet them the next day because he wanted time with them, which upset me since I was looking forward to going out and hadnt eaten much. Then, his mom called again, saying they were 10 minutes from the restaurant. Suddenly, my partner told me to get ready and not embarrass him, but I didnt have enough time and felt like I wasnt really invited anymore. He got angry, yelled, and even raised his hand, but I ignored him. Now, hes saying this will make a bad impression on his grandparents, and Im worried they wont like me. I will see him and his mom in a bit idk what to do",

    "text": "As per my new nightly routine, time to scream into reddits void. I would like to start by preemptively saying I did not intend for things to go this far hence why I am asking for advice. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over two years, and honestly, its been a mess. I love her, but somedays dating her feels more like a chore than out of love. It isnt always like this of course, I love my girlfriend for a reason, but we are long distance. Long distance sucks. We fight a lot, we disagree a good bit, and its hard to relive that old spark. With that said, I love her. I couldnt imagine a life without her. Shes my biggest supporter, my number 1, and I still feel butterflies when I hear her name. She is perfect, and happiness with her is the best feeling ever. Now for the title. Ive worked at this movie theatre for almost a year now. The whole time I have been here everybody has been incredibly nice to me, and Ive tried my best to be nice back. The management favors me, my coworkers seem to find me pleasant company. Now, this is all fine and dandy, but there is this one girl. Jesse, ill call her. Since starting here Jesse has caught my eye. I ignore it, feeling guilty I find anybody other than my girlfriend attractive. Well, my girlfriend and I have been ice lately. I gave Jesse a bit more attention than I should have. She grows closer to me and I realize shes the one coworker that I actually dont mind holding conversation with. For months it doesnt go further than that, just friendly greetings and whatnot. But, about two weeks ago she is on the verge of obvious tears, and I decide to do the macho manly thing and show sympathy. Kill me, I know We talked about 10 minutes, I gave her some of my leftover food, made sure she was laughing, and then I went home. Since this encounter she has been much friendlier to me and has began to worry me a bit. Like, she is more observant with my actions, making positive comments about my looks your eyes are so brown and pretty, i never noticed that!, and shares her food with me. I am not a cheater. But I will admit than she has shown me the attention that I been craving from my girlfriend. Of course I feel shitty thinking this way, but I cant help it. As of today I began ghosting her, cutting work conversations short, keeping things clear and professional, and walking away from her whenever possible at work. Yes, im a jerk, yes I feel terrible, and yes, I hate that I may be hurting others. I know ghosting her is wrong, but I dont know how to handle these kinds of situations. Any comments are helpful, please.",

    "text": "So heres what happened. A few days ago, I sent a private, respectful message to my mother in law because something she said really hurt me. During a conversation, I was being open about missing my husband her son, and she suddenly said while laughing twice Why are you a sheep?. I didnt even register how offensive that was until after, and it really got to me. I felt mocked, belittled, and honestly disrespected. So I took a deep breath and wrote her a thoughtful message. I told her I didnt like being called names like that, even if it was a joke, and that I dont find it funny when people compare me to animals. I said it with love and maturity I wasnt rude or confrontational at all. She replied with what seemed like a sweet apology saying forgive me I didnt mean to and it broke my heart a bit. I felt hope. I thought, maybe shes trying. Maybe she respects how I feel. Fast forward to today: I went to her house, even though deep down I had this gut feeling that she might bring it up publicly. And guess what? She did. In front of all her daughters she stood over me literally standing while I was sitting and said loudly: Are you still sad? I didnt mean to hurt you. I made one mistake I treated you like one of my daughters and joked with you like I do with them. But from now on, Ill have boundaries with you, and Ill watch my words because clearly youre different. It was like she was saying, Youre too sensitive, and now I have to tiptoe around you. I felt frozen. Small. Like she stripped me of any right to feel hurt and flipped the blame onto me. Everyone else was silent it felt like a performance, and I was the subject. I told her, You can still see me as your daughter, but I am sensitive and I dont like being called names. Even your son knows that I cant take certain jokes. She nodded and said she respects me for being honest but I could barely breathe. I was zoning out the rest of the day. I stayed with them but felt completely drained and anxious. I hate how it made me feel. I hate how she used my vulnerability to re establish power in front of her family. And I hate that I knew shed do this and still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Shes smart. Shes sharp. And sometimes, she can be incredibly mean but wrapped in politeness. I just wanted to share because I feel so sad. I stood up for myself, but somehow I still ended up feeling small. I dont want to feel like this again. I dont want to be caught off guard anymore.",

    "text": "Hey everyone, Im building a persona called JadeUnseen across Reddit, Threads, and Ko-fi. Its centered around slow-burn storytelling, seductive themes, and emotionally charged content. It leans sensual, sometimes explicit, but its all about tension, buildup, and mood not just shock value. Im not trying to promote it here, just genuinely looking for advice on how to grow something like this organically. Some questions Im stuck on: How do you turn early attention into real support? What platforms or strategies have helped you build your brand from scratch? What makes you actually follow or support a new creator? Any tips, feedback, or even subreddit suggestions would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",

    "title": "19F very much in a pickle :",
    "text": "hello! I am 19F and I have gotten myself into a situation that Im unsure and really anxious about. First of all, I am autistic, ocd, dyspraxic and I have really bad social anxiety and rejection sensitivity dysphoria! so I have a best friend who Ill call E. weve been friends since we were about 5 but didnt stay in super consistent contact after secondary school. nowadays we have been speaking a lot more and hanging out together, and at one point she introduced me to her other best friend who Ill call R. i want to describe the full story so i might include unecessary details but im just trying to share my feelings in order if that makes sense! my first impression of R was that he was funny, calm and friendly.. I was nervous around him like i am usually with everyone! I felt drawn to him but also cautious because i find it hard to trust other people. So when he took an interest in me and seemed to want to get to know me, i pushed aside my worries and was also curious about him, so i reciprocated and spent a lot of time with him. at first, we played lots of video games together and called, texted all the time and whatnot. he would subtly flirt with me but im rlly socially oblivious so my friend had to tell me herself haha... and eventually i warmed up to him and it felt like i could be childlike and happy around him, whereas usually im quite suppressive of that part of me. I just felt so warm and safe. E ended up suggesting to me that R and I would be a really nice couple. and she said how even before he met me, she would talk about me a lot she tends to affectionately tell everyone about me aha and hed always ask about me. she said that he met me and told her that im the sweetest person hes ever met : and i was really glad to hear that because i was starting to really like him too! he also asked me out on a date and he sounded super nervous aha So we ended up meeting in person for the first time, with me, E and her boyfriend, and R. It was a really lovely day and I had so much fun.. I was really nervous and to be honest I could barely look at him because he was really pretty but anyways, he complimented my outfit and he bought my food for me we went on a picnic, and he brought his jacket incase i got cold which made me really happyy we continued texting loads and he was always really caring towards me, and got increasingly more flirty hahaa. I remember E saying that R said he was worried about scaring me off or making me overwhelmed but that he does really enjoy my company and thinks im really lovely. E always sent me screenshots of him gushing over me and said that i was all he talked about all day, that he really adores me and shes never seen him act like this about anyone before, and he himself has never felt this way about anyone and he cant wait to be mine aha : then one day i went on the train with E to see him perform in his band. we were waiting for his turn to perform and sitting at a table together with the rest of our friends and his. he introduced me to all his friends and he cuddled me while we were sitting and made sure i was okay! and then he held my hand when we were going back to the train and kissed my forehead and let me nap in his arms it was just super sweet aaahh! it was maybe the best day of my life honestly. and then the next day i had my first ever kiss with him, and he confessed that he really likes me and then we cuddled and watched films!! It doesnt really sound like a vent so far... but heres where things started to get really busy for him with uni and work. he would always apologise for not having time to talk or reply, but would always make sure i was alright and update me throughout the day and stuff! we didnt ever establish a relationship btw. he would end up just getting more and more distant though, and one day i got a message from E. It was basically her saying that she was worried about the sustainability of me and R being in a relationship, that hes very far head in life, but also in a really unstable place in his life with his uni/work and moving out - and she worries that neither of us are ready or will end up hurt because of all that he has going on. she said she was worried that my anxiety and autism would make it difficult for me to cope, that she rushed into introducing us when maybe the time isnt right even tho we obviously both have feelings for eachother. that sometimes if youre in a rush to get somewhere, you need to hit the brakes before you crash. i think it was fair, even though i was really devestated by hearing it. i felt like i wasnt good enough for him, that if i didnt have as many needs with my disability it mightve worked out.. or that it was all my fault for scaring him away, maybe it was my fault for being so behind in life or that im not as lovable as i couldve been. i know that might sound like a really far out reaction or thought process, but i felt that way bc i have some abandonment trauma and it sent me into quite the panic! I spent the next few days panicking because i think i knew deep down that she was right and it really pained me to think that we might not be together. Or that she mightve regretted us coming together, it just stung really bad : But eventually he just got more and more distant until he asked me if we could talk and he sent me this message: youve probably noticed ive been a bit distant over like the last 4 days or so, if im being completely honest with you i feel like ive kinda jumped into everything a little bit too quickly and i feel as though i havent judged the way that i feel properly. im really sorry and i dont want you to be led on or feel like thats what im doing, i would still like to be friends and we can still hang out with everyone, cause thats super fun!! i just dont think with everything thats gonna happen this year for me and everything thats already going on that im in the right spot to be supporting someone else if that makes sense? im just really not in a spot to commit myself to someone, it wouldnt be fair on you either cause i dont feel like i have really got the time that i want to give It was weird. I felt almost relieved to have an answer as to why he had suddenly seemed to disappear. But once that feeling was over, i ended up feeling like i was being abandoned or that something id been hoping for for so long had been snatched back away from me. I replied saying that i understood and, in the heat of my emotions i said, i did kind of assume that you would rather not be with me after all so i am quite sad, but i appreciate you telling me early on : to which he responded please dont say that thats not exactly the nicest way to put it. i felt and still feel really bad about it because i didnt ever want to upset him when he was just trying to be honest... and i dont really know what he means by it either because my autism makes it hard for me to understand things people say sometimes. the last thing he said to me was im more than happy to be your friend still thats not gonna change, i just think i need to take a bit of time to get some perspective on what works for me. and after that i apologised for wording my message badly and i said that it would be nice if we slow down and be friends for the meantime like he wants.. i didnt get a reply for a couple days so i texted again to say that im still here for him and whatnot, and that didnt get a reply either so i just asked him how he is about a week later i think. But since all that, its been about a month and a half since he has spoken to me and my texts have been on delivered ever since. I just dont know why everything has gone cold... i thought he wanted to stay friends but now he wont even speak to me? : he still posts fairly regularly, speaks to all his other friends, hangs out with them and stuff. I just feel really really sad because i feel like im just being ignored and suddenly dumped by someone who i really felt fondly about and who seemed to feel like that for me too... he still looks at my insta stories and posts the little insta note songs that seem aimed at him missing me although i might just be reading into ittt I know that i dont deserve to be ghosted and i am hoping for some kind of apology if he does come back, but it just hurts so much and i dont know if he still cares about me or not : or why hes just completely silent.. i dont know if the last message was him saying he was taking time to get perspective as in literally no contact but im just so confused and my heart is really heavy. i cant help but think, did i do something wrong?, does he hate me now?, does he ever even wanna see me again?. i know im being really dramatic but i really feel those thoughts and ive been trying so hard to think positive and not jump to black and white conclusions but my brain structure makes it so difficult.. i could really use some reassurance or outside perspective :, ty for reading it all 33",

Weve has ups and downs but for the most part before we moved in we communicated effectively, worked together well and we have a strong friendship bond that it sprouted from. We both mutually agree that theres a lot of love for each other and the relationship isnt a lost cause but our sex life just isnt there..granted Ive had to overcome hurdles due to PTSD but I dont think thats the case this time. I feel like weve gotten into a cycle of doom scrolling on social media, dates dont feel like they have meaning/last minute and romance is kind of dead..we cuddle and hug etc we tell each other we appreciate eachother but purposeful romance is not there if that makes sense..and now when he tries it doesnt hit the same...I feel bad because hes cute but he doesnt turn me on.. the idea of intimacy is overwhelming. Im already spiralling because Ive realized Ive ignored relationship concerns and now I have to face them head on and suddenly everything feels like its moving too fast. Ive disassociate for years and kind of went wherever the wind took us. I have needs and desires and fantasies but cannot bring myself to play them out with him..I ended up avoiding sex and we can go months without having it to the point where when we finally do..I dont um..you know.. Is this normal for a long term relationship?? How have you overcome it vs letting it go",
