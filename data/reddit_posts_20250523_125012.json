    "title": "Has SCHD replaced BND for retirement portfolios?",
    "text": "Are bond funds outdated? It seems like the SCHD dividend fund has replaced the BND bond-type of fund in many peoples retirement portfolio. No longer 60/40 stock/bond but rather some combination of the dividend producing, SCHD and growth fund like VOO. And, after running examples on Monte Carlo, I guess I can see why. For example a portfolio just over 1.5M shows these Low/Medium/High returns after 20 years. no inflation adj. VOO 60/BND 40 1.6M, 3M, 5M VOO 60/SCHD 40 6M, 15M, 31M Im interested in peoples opinion of your favorite portfolio during retirement. Are bond funds still popular?",

    "title": "I am doing everything so I dont lose my spark over this 9-6 job, what else can I do?",
    "text": "Hello everybody, I hope you all are doing great, I feel like my concern needs a little context, so I am starting there. I 29F am a very energetic person. I worked since I was 22 years old, did a 4 years retail job then paused to finish my studies, and after I graduated I started a desk job at travel agency company and worked there for 9 months. I felt like I was losing my mind, I did an office job before that, but it didnt felt as imprisoned as that one. I had to work 9-5 and I didnt have any time left for ANYTHING that I cared about. At the end of the day I always felt tired, couldnt wait to go home lived 30 minutes away, shower, eat something and rest, so I thought I better quit this job and something better will come along. I know that this sounds strange to the most countries in the world, but I live with my parents and my brother and his family, its common where I come from to live with your family until you get married, so I didnt have to mind things like: rent, electric bills, etc, since we own a huge house and my brother takes care of everything. I live in a small city where is really hard to find a suitable job and for a whole year I looked online, searched any possible option within my ideal job, but I couldnt find anything, at this point I was ready to move out to a different city, but luck wasnt on my side on that case either. I cant lie, I enjoyed my un-employed era so much, since money wasnt a problem for me, which I am so grateful for btw, I read books, I took care of my body, ate healthy, spent time with my loved ones, went out on coffee dates with my friends, brunches, etc.. But, through all the time there was a guilt inside me feeling worthless or doing nothing to improve myself professionally. My brother owns a business and he got an opportunity to open a second one, but with a partner friend of his, so they needed someone who they trust and who is capable of the job the work involves a lot of money activities. So, my brother asked me to start a job in his company until the company starts in a good foot and until I find something better. I swore I will never do again a 9-5 job, but it was my brothers company, I was free with my time and of course I felt I needed to step in, I would step in even for free, since my brother takes care of everything and it has always been my biggest supporter in everything since I can remember myself. I have to work from Monday to Saturday from 9:00 in the morning, until 18:00 in the afternoon. In the beginning, I didnt mind it, because I knew it will last only a couple months since we open another shop, and then well figure it out the exact working hours and days off, and doing most of the work to help the company improve, made me feel so good, and my brother being one of my bosses made that feeling stronger. But, those couple months became 7 months at this point, and its driving me NUTS. Weve discussed this with my brother and his partner, and they are trying to find a solution as soon as possible, theyll hire someone else in June probably, but my battery is almost dead. I wake up at 6:30 in the morning, get ready, go to CrossFit I started it 6 months ago, come straight in my work, and I am sitting at my desk for 9 hours a day, with non stop clients coming in and going out, sometimes I cant even eat my food I have no breaking hours either, and when I finish my shift, there are so rarely moments I go out for coffee, usually I go straight up in my home, my energy dries up, I just do what I need to do, and I sleep immediately. This has been my life for the past 7 months and I am feeling so low, I never get dressed how I used to, I gained weight, I dont feel as beautiful as I did before, I dont have the energy to read books, to go on walks anymore or to do my hobbies. I only have my Sunday free, and usually I have to wash my clothes, clean my room, or I spend all my day in bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone. I feel my confidence going down, but every time I feel like that, I remind myself how privileged and grateful I should feel, I remind myself that this isnt going to last forever and thats what gets me up in the morning. I still try to be positive and look at the bright side: I do physical activities every morning, I try to do that also during the day in my office because I hate the feeling of being sat all day, I get to work alone in my office which I truly like because whenever I have some free time I can watch something on YouTube, sometimes a movie, sometimes just scroll through Reddit or social media, I drink my coffee in the morning, during the day sometimes also, I dont have a strict boss over my head, I can contribute to the company of my brother while also having my own salary, and things like that. I negotiated with both of my bosses about my requirements and we are trying to meet in the middle. Me and my brother never mess business with our siblings relationship, I have to report 90 of the work related things to his partner, since my brother doesnt want to be involved that much in decision making of the company, only fundamental things. He has his own business to care of and pretty much this is the whole dynamic in our work related situation. I dont want to let him down, I also am a person who has really good work ethic no matter who I work for, but I am feeling mentally so down. What can I add to my mentality, or routine so I can keep my spark alive and get my confidence back? Thank you all in advance, sorry for the long post, and also sorry for my English.",

To be more specific and ik this is where most people might get confused but im into the swinging lifestyle and she is a very strictly into only me and her in our sex life but i want all the kinky stuff that involving other people brings to the table you know. I just dont know if Im being ridiculous to put my sexual desires above my son and his mother but weve talked about adding other people even just another guy but she feels like if leave her but its really one of my biggest fantasies I dont know if I should keep hiding the fact that Im watching swinger porn to fill the voidshe hates that I watch porn?",

During my 1 week stay I broke my arm stepping out of the shower, the step is very steep, and the floor was highly polished making it very slippery even when not wet, there is no warning signs or mats to prevent this, I was in the hospital and got a cast. However the last 4 days of my vacation was in bed or sitting down due to negligence on the showers safety. Is there a possibility I could be reimbursed for a portion of my vacation from the organiser or insurance? The vacation was a package if this helps. I should note when I arrived back in the uk, My doctor said I should contact them and call a solicitor. Id like to get some advice before potentially wasting my time, and energy.",

    "text": "Tonight is the bachelorette party and so far shes told me that yeah theyre going out for some drinks. I overthought and then asked if strippers are going to be involved to which she replied with possibly. I then went over how 1. She knows my opinion on strips clubs 2. How I dont want her being around naked men and thats just a boundary of mine. Shes been acting dismissive of my boundary and acting like its not a big deal. Ive told her that a boundary is a boundary and partners should be respectful of boundaries. She then talked about well what am I supposed to do if they all want to go to the strip club and im left alone. I replied try get a friend to uber back to the hotel with you and if not its not your fault if you dont go as the bachelorette party shouldve decided on a plan for the night. She said its unlikely someone will come back with me to which I said well im sorry but this is a decision you need to make on whether you want to respect my boundary or not. I then talked about how its concerning you dont see a problem with breaking a boundary of mine, to which she said I do see it as a problem and see going to a stripclub as a problem. I think she said that last part as a way to end the conversation as at the beginning she saw no problem in any of it. Somewhere in there I said if you break a boundary of mine I will break up with you, the same way you told me if I broke a boundary of yours youd break up with me. Convo ended with her saying I love u and goodnight. still with her stance that she will go the strippers if everyone else does Background info: Been dating for 2.3 yrs Been to a stripclub together.it was my gfs friends bday and I was told were going to a new club, i walk into the place and im confronted with boobs in my face so from that moment we went over our thoughts on strippers TLDR My gf on 2.3 yrs is overseas for a wedding and doesnt see problem with going to a male strip club after knowing abt what my boundaries are. I dont know what to say to her tomorrow, whether she goes or doesnt go. Has anyone else has been in this position?",

    "title": "I F24 dramatically sighed picking up my sisters 26F phone. Shes ignoring me now",
    "text": "Yesterday, my mom had surgery to get stones removed. I was at the hospital with my grandma, waiting for my parents to come to the hospital. While we were waiting, I was on the phone with two of my friends to help pass the time and stay distracted. To make this clear: Her surgery is at 11. I was at the hospital at 10, waiting for my mom to come. While I was on the call, my sister tried to call me. I saw her call, but I figured Id call her back in a couple of minutes after finishing my conversation. Instead, she ended up calling my grandma. My grandma told her I was on the phone with friends, and I overheard my sister say harshly, Shes calling her friends?! Why?! Im calling her!! Mind you, she called me RIGHT after talking to my mom on the phone. She knew she was on her way. As soon as I heard that, I hung up on my friends and took my grandmas phone to talk to my sister. Because I had just overheard her angry reaction, I answered the call with a heavy sigh and said, What? She didnt like that at all. She immediately confronted me, saying that the way I spoke to her was completely inappropriate. I tried to explain that I only responded like that because I had overheard what she said about me to our grandma. But things escalated. She began yelling, saying things like Im not normal, what if something important had happened, that Im ungrateful, etc. I couldnt take it, so I hung up the phone. Afterward, I saw she was typing me messages on WhatsApp, and I blocked her temporarily because I knew they would be hurtful. I unblocked her after two minutes. Then she sent me a bunch of messages, calling me a dirty pig, saying my friends should have been in the hospital instead of our mom, and that I only care about my friends, and that Im disgusting and ungrateful. I didnt respond to any of that, but it really hurt. About ten hours later, she called me. I answered, hoping we could make things right. She said, Okay, maybe my tone was off, but she still stood by everything she said, insisting my behavior was not normal. I said maybe my tone was off too, but only because I had heard her say something negative about me first, which is why I answered the way I did. She then started going off again, saying it was none of my business how she talks to our grandma. Then she started screaming, and I mean screaming, at the top of her lungs on the phone, saying Im the worst person ever, that I always think Im the smart, calm, collected sibling, that I try to coach everyone, and that I think Im perfect. But that I am the one whos sick in my head. That I am mentally ill. My sister is diagnosed with ptsd by the way, I always try to help her calm down when shes angry I hung up the phone in her face. Later, I texted her an apology, not because I feel I was completely wrong, but just to try and calm things down. I wrote: Im sorry for everything. She hasnt responded since. Im still hurt and confused. I was just talking to my friends on the phone, and now it feels like Ive been attacked for it. When situations like these happen, I never, ever argue back since she often threathens to off herself or harm herself in a way when shes overstimulated. And Im so scared shell do it one day, due to the fact that she has ptsd and anger issues. This behavior isnt new by the way. Shes always angry very quickly. I am really confused now. I am genuinely starting to think theres something wrong with me. Some say I shouldnt have talked to my friends on the phone, others say that its normal for my sister to get worried.",

After our two meet ups, I felt energised and happy.I am going away for school training stuff and I have gotten to thinking what this really means and how it could be.We have no clear title and sometimes when I put the chats onto chatgpt it picks up on me carrying the bulk of emotion while he feeds off the banter and sexual innuendos.I think I am already attached, I really wanted this to bloom into something beautiful.How should I go about this?How do I not lose myself?",

I stopped to help her clean up, noticing her knee was bleeding quite a bit, so I drove her to a nearby clinic. Afterward, I learned she was home aloneher parents are separated, and her mother, with whom she lives, is often away. Feeling sympathetic, I invited her to my favorite Greek restaurant for a meal, then dropped her off at her house. I gave her my phone number in case she needed anything, as we live close by, but I didnt ask for hers to avoid making her uncomfortable. The next day, she sent me a heartfelt, lengthy thank-you text. She mentioned how shed gotten my car seats muddy and how I didnt mind, how much she appreciated my help, and how she loved the Greek restaurant. Reading her message was one of the happiest moments of my lifeI hadnt realized Id made such an impact. We started texting and hanging out casually. I took her to a few other great restaurants I know, and she seemed to enjoy every moment we spent together. At first, I saw her like a younger sister. We grew closer, spending more time together at my place or going out. She began asking for my advice on adult matters like career and school, and I even taught her how to drive. Over time, though, I noticed a shift. She started acting more like a girlfriend than a sister, which has left me confused. When we first met, she was wearing her high school uniform, and I mentally registered her as a kid shes in her final year of high school, about to be 19. Now, we cuddle while watching movies, and although she goes home each night she lives very close, I sense she wants to stay but is too shy to do so. Im unsure how to handle this or how to bring it up with her. Im also worried about the futureshes becoming increasingly dependent on me. She doesnt seem to have many friends besides me, and I dont think shes ever had a boyfriend. I find her sweet and charming, but the idea of seeing her as a girlfriend makes me uneasy, like Id be taking advantage of her or grooming her. Im not sure what to do next. Whats the best way to approach this situation? my ultimate goal is to not upset her in any way.",

    "title": "Adjusting Alimony that has Ended 8-9 years post Divorce?",
    "text": "Location: New York State Our divorce was finalized approximately 8-9 years ago. I was awarded 4 years of alimony, and half of his military retirement once he retires. The marriage was abusive and it was a fi gf t to keep him compliant with the divorce decree and alimony. He would skip payments, he refused to take me off of our mortgage and then didnt pay the mortgage, hitting my credit for many years. Etc. Within a year of when we were divorced, I was awarded disability. It had been a four year process. In New York, this made me eligible for lifetime alimony, but I didnt know I could go back and try to have the divorce order amended. My ex has made it widely known that he doesnt want to retire because he doesnt want me to get any money. Moreover, hes tried to take various actions to intentionally pursue disability, as he knows retirement covered by his disability isnt eligible for payments. I only get 840 per month in disability. I cant cover a lot, including dental. Im losing teeth. Im tube fed and use a wheelchair. Insurance covers some but not everything, when it comes to managing those items. Ive been told I can attempt to have the divorce amended and get alimony again, especially since my disability was in progress when the divorce was also in progress. 1. Is it possible to have a divorce amended, many years later? 2. Would any attorney consider pursuing this worth it for their client? My main concern is 840 isnt something I can live off of and save anything. It doesnt cover housing, so Im dependent on others to provide shelter etc. TLDR Can you amend a divorce settlement many years later in New York State? There is an expectation of 50/50 retirement split but there was 4 heads of alimony initially. I, the spouse receiving alimony, became disabled during this time, but shortly following the finalization of the divorce.",
