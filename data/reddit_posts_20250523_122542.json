    "title": "ExM 33 broke up with me F 29 two months ago. I begged him to come back. He blocked me four days ago. How do I move on from this person I so deeply loved and envisioned a future with?....",
    "text": "We met on an online platform. It was an online long distance. Both from different countries and cultures. First two months were great. Then he got promoted and I couldnt be happier, felt so proud. Things started changing in November. I could sense the distance and whenever I brought it up, he asked to not be upset with the time were apart and to enjoy the time we spent together. I did my best to remain patient. Regular phonecalls and texting changed to a few times a week. But I thought maybe this will get better in time. We had an argument on Dec 30 about the same issues and I asked if we could talk on the phone but he said no. Next day, I waited for him all day. I was hoping to reconnect and sort things out since it was new years eve and wanted to ring in the new year with happy thoughts. He texted me around 2 am - Happy New years babe. Tired. Going to bed. I was relieved to see that text and thought he was probably exhausted from work. Next day, while texting, I asked how was his new years and he goes - nothing special. His sisters friends came over with appetizers so he made steaks for everyone and they all watched a movie together. And shared a drink at midnight. I was glad he had a good time but it hurt when I realized he was home the whole time and didnt bother to text once. I didnt get to see him much in Jan-Feb because he was busy with his work. And all the waiting and days of silence made me impatient. I didnt want to lose him. I loved him. I still do. And when a friend from the same online platform asked me about how things were going, I opened up to her. Told her things were good, its just that I missed him and the time we spent together. She suggested that theres nothing wrong in asking if hes open to texting every other day as a regular check in. She even offered to help type up the whole thing and sent me the texts. I double checked with her to make sure there was nothing rude but she assured me that theres nothing wrong with asking for two minutes. The gist of the texts goes like this - I love you and I miss spending time with you. I understand youre busy but I was hoping if we could text for two minutes every other day, not every day. And if you think thats too much of me to ask then I feel we should go our separate ways. I thought the text was a bit harsh and I didnt want to add the latter part but she assured me that theres nothing wrong with asking for clarity. I forwarded those texts as it is. He took less than a minute to dump me over text. He dumped me in March and I begged him for two straight months to forgive me and come back. He didnt. He brought up so many issues he had with me. He blamed me for everything. He insulted me and mocked me while I was crying. I kept going back because I thought and hoped that I could still save us. He said I gave him an ultimatum, something he doesnt tolerate. I told him I didnt think it was an ultimatum. I was looking for ways to reconnect because it felt like he was becoming distant every passing day. We hadnt spoken on the phone for four months. How is that not distant? He wouldnt text me for 5-7 days a week. How is that not distance? All I wanted was to see how he was doing and sending a single text here and there was all I had hoped for. But he kept throwing insults at me that sometimes I got so mad and responded to those insults and said horrible stuff to him. Then he used my reactions to justify the breakup. I dont know how to react or process this whole thing. He finally blocked me four days ago. It absolutely crushed me. He said I was harrassing him with my constant texting. He would say his piece and then tell me not to respond. So, I texted him at a time when I thought I would be able to respond to the things he said to me, without being dismissed or told STOP MESSAGING ME. But he got mad and blocked me. I dont know what to do now. Ive only cried since the day he dumped me. Didnt think it would get worse but it did after he blocked me. Someone close to me reached out to him and this was his response - Please leave me alone. I blocked her because she continues to harass me at all hours. She doesnt stop even if im sleeping or at work. I have nothing to say or talk about. Leave me alone I respected his boundaries and wished him well I fell in love with him. I envisioned a future with him. Started working towards a life where I could become his support. Stuff like getting married, kids, buying a house, growing old together... Started saving towards that life. All of that is gone now. I still pray for his well being every night before I go to bed. I dont know what to do. How do I move on from the love of my life?....",

    "text": "I dont really know who to talk to about this, so Im turning to Reddit for some perspective. Over the past year, Ive been trying to grow my savings through stocks and options. I wasnt gambling blindly I followed earnings reports, watched financial news, did my research or at least I thought I did. But it feels like everything I touched turned red. Im down nearly 70 of my portfolio. What hurts most isnt just the money. Its the time, the mental energy, and the hope I had. I really believed I could make something happen, maybe even eventually quit my job if I did well enough. But now I just feel like a fool. Im not here to blame the market. I know I made mistakes maybe I was overconfident, maybe I didnt have a real strategy. Ive been rethinking everything: should I stop investing entirely? Should I go back to just saving cash? Is there even a way to recover from this? Have any of you been through something like this? How did you deal with the aftermath financially and emotionally? Appreciate any honest advice or shared experiences.",

I usually just read posts but have never shared my thoughts on Reddit before. I finally decided to post because I feel the need to consult a larger group of people about a problem Im having. To the point: Im a beginner photographer. I used to be a photo model for over 10 years. While Ive been interested in photography theoretically for most of my life, Im new to actually practicing itespecially when it comes to portraits and fashion. Over the past year, Ive done a few TFP photoshoots and one event. Every time, I invest many hours into editing the photos, making them the best I can. I always discuss the concept with the model beforehand, share reference images, and deliver the pictures on time. Everything seems to go welluntil I send the final photos. People often say the photos are really good, but then the models stop responding to me. I dont understand why. Has anyone else experienced this kind of situation with models lately, or is it just me? Its frustrating because I always let them know that if theres anything they dont like, they can message me and Ill fix it. Im still learningand often, so are they. Can anyone help me figure out what might be going wrong? Thanks so much!",

    "title": "Rebuilding My Credit - Credit Card Questions:",
    "text": "Good afternoon, everyone! I have poor credit My credit score stands at 535 with delinquencies, previous past poor credit history, and a bunch of inquiries. I am NOT proud of my credit, and I am disgusted at myself for being irresponsible and realized my mistakes Ive made and owned up too it. My parents also had a play in my credit when I financed things for them and they never paid it - lessons learned. OpenSky gave me a credit card - I started with 100 but they did approve me for a credit line increase. Do I keep the balance below 30 for faster and more efficient credit building? If I use 5-15 a week and pay it off that week will that help build credit faster? Also, I am using Lexington Law and they have removed a bunch of stuff off of my credit which has tremendously helped as well ... I thought about getting a second secured credit card as well but would that hurt me even more? Thank you!",

The male decides after the fact that he doesnt want a serious relationship and doesnt wanna proceed further with her, although they remain coworkers and still are friends. She cant except that he doesnt want a serious relationship, so as a revenge tactic, 2 years later she goes to the police and said the male coworker raped her, saying she revoked consent or something similar, however she also still texts him trying to hang out with him.

    "text": "Hey yall I need some advice but I need to give some context on my life, gonna try keep this as short and sweet as possible. Im a 25m Im currently in radiography school with hopes of becoming an interventional radiography tech, but when I was a child I had an alcoholic father, my parents divorced when I was 11-12 and I never talked to my dad again to this day, high school was rough, did enough Xanax to sleep an elephant was put into SPED classes despite nothing being wrong. Once I graduated I realized that I gave up on my life and I needed to turn it around, I enrolled in community college and basically had to learn all of the things I missed for 4 years, I stayed there a year then transferred to a state school and got my degree in health science in hopes of going to grad school for physical therapy. My senior year of college I was 21, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer , this was really hard for me, I didnt apply to physical therapy school during the year because I was just an emotional mess and decided I will just take a gap year between undergrad and grad school. This gap year ended up being two years because I realized I dont actually want to be a physical therapist and paying for grad school would cause more stress than good. During this time I found out about interventional radiography and decided this Is what i wanted to do and started applying to radiography school. During this time I noticed a lump on my remaining testicle and of course at 24 I had cancer on my other testicle. This completely fucked my life up, I was already accepted into radiography school. But this made me give up. Now were here, almost a year into the program Im writing this because Ive given up on my life once, and I learned a valuable lesson that no matter what your going through even cancer, you cant give up on the main thing whatever that is because your future self will fucking hate you for setting yourself up to fail. But that really all I got, I can only seem to do the main thing I go to class and clinical and do well on my tests and perform well at clinical. But thats it other than that my life is nothing. I do nothing outside of this, I have no friends and dont want to make friends. Everything in my life feels like a chore, even things I used to really enjoy. I just cant seem to enjoy anything, I workout everyday, I try to journal and read things all In hopes some sort of routine or something I read will change my perspective. but nothing else seems to give me any pleasure anymore, and Im just getting to this point where I dont want to quit, but I dont want to live a life where I feel like this everyday. If anybody has any advice for me that you think could help Ill take anything. If not thank you for listening to my little story and wish you the best in life!!",

    "text": "So to clarify i love my girlfriend and everything but this is too much now... Ive been with her for about a year now our relationship is great so far but theres something that bothers me about her... to the point i have to literally force myself into having sex with her. so the first thing is she doesnt shave like ever she doesnt even maintain her pubic hair just lets it grow and it spreads to her thighs and belly and on top of that her boobs are extremely saggy she also has stretch marks all over her body. When i first saw her naked i was shocked because with clothes on shes at least 7/10 but when she took them off i feel bad to admit this but i felt disgusted and lost all my desire to have sex with her... but i pretended like nothing to get it over with she also insists to sit on my face every time we fuck and i hate it so much for her it maybe feels good but i have to have my mouth full of hair and that terrible smell...i suggested shaving to her but she got pissed at me and accused me of not loving her what should i do?",
