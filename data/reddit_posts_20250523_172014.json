Ive tried posting this to the Jackson Hole subreddit and Wyoming subreddit but am not able to. A friend of mine on vacation struck up a relationship with a local guy at the end of March and fast forward to the end of April we found out hes had a long term girlfriend the whole time. A man playing around with multiple women at once is one thing but Im concerned about the fact that hes lying about his sexual history and STD/STI status to women and getting intimate with them unprotected, and in the case of my friend, unprotected without her consent. My friend only found out about the STD because she ended up getting tested and found out he gave her a lifelong STD and also found out shes pregnant he had stealthed her one night they were together. Our mutual friend reached out to his girlfriend to warn her, but she didnt seem to be shocked and insinuated that he has a history of cheating or that they may have an open relationship. Our mutual friend stupidly gave his girlfriend our friends contact information and were assuming that either she or he has been giving that out because shes been bombarded with calls from people we assume are their friends telling her that she needs to abort the baby. Two other women also reached out to her and let her know shes not the only one: one said the same guy also gave her the same STD about 6 months ago, and another about 3 months ago. Im not sure what to do besides say that fellow women in the area or visiting the area please be sure to protect yourself. Im not sure what I should do except try to be there for my friend, even though shes moving halfway across the county soon. But this man should not be able to get away with this pattern of behavior especially because hes in his 30s and the women he seems to target are in their earlier to mid 20s.",

He 21M takes hours to respond which I normally wouldnt care I get he has a life but his responses have been so short. He stopped asking me questions about my day and stuff like that and doesnt really continue the conversation. It seems weird cause I thought he was really into me and he still sometimes says stuff that implies he likes me but then he gets short with me again. Did things just move way too quickly and now hes over it? Not sure if I should ask him whats up, move on, or just pretend everything is normal. I mean the relationship is so new but I did like him so it would kinda suck losing him just as fast TLDR guy Ive been seeing feels like hes pulling away, not sure if I should move on or address it",

    "title": "Is It Weird That I Bought A Stuffed Toy as an Adult That I Never Got to Have as a Child?",
    "text": "It has been something that Ive been keeping secret for a while. It feels odd to even share it here, but I guess I wanted to get it out in the open. When I 25M was growing up, my sister had this cute stuffed bunny that she called Terry. I remember being instantly drawn to him for some reason or another. I often just wanted to hold him, or touch the soft terrycloth fabric he was made from. I also liked to shake him and hear the soft chime/rattle thing that he had inside of him. Id usually go for him when he wasnt being played with. For a while, it was brushed of as being the silly, annoying younger sibling taking his siblings toy. At the end of the day, shed always get him back and I wouldnt be allowed to play with him. Eventually, I asked for my own Terry. I put it on my Christmas list for many years, but sadly I never got one. My parents just said that they couldnt find one again. I dont think they really tried to either. My guess was, they thought I had my own toys and wanting the same one wouldve been seen as her little brother intruding or something. That she couldnt have something that was just hers and hers alone. Eventually I stopped asking when I wouldve been seen as too old for a stuffed bunny. As I got older though, I tried to sneak it out more and more. Id sneak into her room to give Terry a quick snuggle while she was off at Girl Scouts, sports or sleepovers. In a humorous way, it was like a junkie getting a fix lol. One time, I think I was around 9 or so, my mom caught me in the act and flipped out. I was called a sneak and a creep, like Id committed some ultimate sin. The reaction was a bit over the top looking back. She reacted like she discovered me trying on her clothes whilst wearing red lipstick or something. It was embarrassing to say the least. She even let my sister know, which caused her to safeguard the toy even more. I still found ways to play with it though. But with that, came new feelings of guilt and shame that stuck with me for years. Fast forward to college. I was living on my own for the first time. The toy randomly popped into my head again as it had on and off. I searched the general description online, and it actually led to one for sale online. The exact same one that she had growing up. Although, it was now listed as vintage which kinda made me feel old haha. I bought it, when the package came, I was thrilled. I didnt know whether to laugh or cry, It was my own Terry. Part of me still felt that twinge of embarrassment. Both for what happened when I was younger, and the fact that I was a grown man who was sitting in his bedroom with a stuffed bunny with a little rattle inside. I also felt a bit sad that it took this long to get one. That night, I slept with him, and I think I had the best nights sleep in years. I still never told anyone about the bunny. Hed get stashed away during visits and dates, I was far too embarrassed given the background. Ive especially never brought it up to my family because honestly howd you react Hey, my bro got a copy of my beloved childhood toy that he was weirdly obsessed with. Thats....uhhh...weird for lack of a better word. Insane? Batshit? Despite said weirdness, I think Ive done pretty well. Ive got a decent job, an apartment, friends, etc. Ive had some mental health stuggles that Ive been working through with the help of therapy. Mainly depression, anxiety and recently diagnosed OCD. To which, I think might explain a lot, but, Im too embarrassed to mention it in a session. I havent dated too seriously since college, and theres some fear of being judged there too. I guess in a long-winded way, Im asking, is it too weird? Is it something I should address, or just accept?",

My parents were fortunate enough to buy a home on the beachfront as their primary residence immediately before the housing boom, and Im well aware that Im going to be the one inheriting the house. Being as Im established where I am, Im more than likely going to sell the property, hopefully to a family. I hate gentrifiers, snowbirds, and landlords. Are there any legal precedents where I can ask a lawyer to write up a contract that has something to the effect of, Under no circumstances may this property be used for rentals of any kind, or Discovery of violation of these terms will automatically terminate this contract and will initiate forfeiture of this property? Maybe something like This must be your primary residence? None of this is immediate, Im simply thinking down the line. Thanks in advance, and fuck anyone who profits off of a basic necessity such as housing.",

    "text": "I 35F have been thinking about friendship recently, and I feel a little lost. I hope to hear your opinions or suggestions. I have two friends who used to be very close: L 34F and J 36F. We met in college and spent many important moments together. After graduation, although we were not in the same city, we kept in touch regularly. In recent years, this contact has gradually faded. L got married two years ago and later had a child. Everything revolves around the family. I understand that she is very busy and try not to disturb her, but over time I found that she almost never takes the initiative to contact me. J is now an entrepreneur, flying around and meeting clients all day long. Sometimes she will reply to my messages after a few days. The last time we met was before the epidemic. I tried to maintain these relationships, but I began to feel like I was chasing friendships. I didnt want to force anyone to chat with me, but I couldnt ignore the feeling of being left out. At the same time, I also tried to make new friends, such as joining sports clubs, interest groups, and social activities. Although I have met some people mostly between 30 and 40 years old, the relationship is very shallow. Many people are just playmates and it is difficult to get into their hearts. Its just that I long for the kind of friendship where we can tell the truth, share vulnerability, and care about each other, rather than just someone in the group photo at the party.",

    "title": "Im considering breaking a long-standing family tradition? Im torn and need outside perspectives.",
    "text": "Hey r/Advice, Im genuinely struggling with something and could use some objective viewpoints. For as long as I can remember, my family has had a tradition of spending every single Thanksgiving at my grandmothers house, where we all have to wear matching, hand-knitted sweaters. Its been a core part of our family identity, and while Ive always participated, lately Ive been feeling a strong pull to spend Thanksgiving with my partners family, who live out of state and I rarely see, or even just have a quiet one at home this year. The problem is, my family is incredibly invested in this tradition. My mom especially would be devastated, and I can already hear the Youre abandoning us! comments. On the other hand, I feel like Im an adult now and should be able to make my own choices, especially when it comes to holidays. I also worry about resenting the tradition if I keep forcing myself into it year after year. Am I being selfish for wanting to do something different? How do you balance family expectations with your own needs and desires, especially when traditions are involved? Has anyone successfully navigated breaking a similar family tradition? Any advice on how to even approach this conversation, or if I should even try? Thanks in advance for any wisdom or shared experiences!",

    "title": "Im at my breaking point, and I dont know what to do. How am I supposed to manage this?",
    "text": "Im entirely at my breaking point, and I dont know who to turn to. For context, Im 21 and nonbinary. My boyfriend broke up with me over text a few days ago. Weve been having some issues for a little while, but Ive been putting all my time and effort into our relationship so we could try and work through it. Clearly, he wasnt interested in doing that. Since then, Ive really been struggling. I think the way he went about it, as well as some things he said like he only feels platonic love towards me he wants to be friends, I cant handle that right now, he never liked calling me every night we were semi long distance, 1.5 hrs, called almost every night for the first 10 months of knowing eachother, etc. have been been making it especially hard. Im so angry, hurt, and upset with him, but at the same time, I want to be near him. I cant stop thinking about holding his hand, memories weve made, kissing him, and spending more time with him. But I also cant stop thinking about the hurt hes caused me over the length of our relationship. I want to reach out to him again and again, but I know that would only make it worse for both of us. Moreover, I had a hysterectomy, oophorectomy, salpingectomy, cervicectomy, and the closure of my vaginal canal exactly two weeks ago today. Ive been stuck in my dingy, shitty apartment which I hate to heal. I live alone, except for my cats. Im miserable here, but my lease isnt up until August, and ending it early would mean a forfeiture of my security deposit, and a 2200 charge, which I just dont have right now. Im out of work for six weeks, and Im on short term disability which doesnt help with my money situation. Theres not a whole lot I can do, other than small walks to leave the apartment, reading, crocheting, watching TV. But everything makes me think of him. I bagged up everything hes given me that weve gotten together over the span of our relationship and put it at my parents house, but everything here still makes me think of him. Even though he wasnt here often one of our issues, because I visited him more than 30 times, he visited me here four times, he was here the first day I moved into this apartment. I feel like we built it together, even though thats not how it happened at all. I just cant stop thinking about him nothing has been able to distract me. I cant sleep, I cant eat, I cant do anything except cry. I also fear Ill never find someone like him again. Even though we had our problems, we got along so well. I had more fun with him than I did with pretty much anyone else in my life. We had a lot of similar interests, and some that werent, but we still shared them with eachother. We were also both trans and autistic, and didnt drink or smoke. And I want to be a piercer, and hes going to be a tattoo artist. I just feel broken in half without him. It also feels like my plans and future have been entirely derailed. I was planning to move to my boyfriends city once my lease was up, to go back to school for mortuary science or find a piercing apprenticeship, but now I know no one up there, and dont want to be even more alone/lonely. I also dont think I could afford it, and I dont know how I could find a roommate. But I hate the city I live in. Ive been here my entire life, and it just feels like a dead end to me. I despise my job, but I cant find a better one. I have hardly any friends 2 close ones, 1 semi close, and dont know how to meet new people. I dont drink or smoke triggering to me, which makes it even harder. Im also fat, trans, autistic, and alternative, which doesnt help either. Ive already been struggling mentally before this. Im insanely lonely, and have a lot of other things to deal with already. I also have depression, anxiety, ocd, and autism. My uncle was diagnosed with bladder cancer. He had surgery to remove both tumors, but they were larger than expected spread to his muscle. He and my dad are the only surviving siblings on that side, as their two other brothers have already died. Those were hard for me to deal with. My dog also died in September, which keeps coming up now that Im grieving someone else, even though its in a different way. Her and everyone else Ive lost in life, mostly to death, both people and pets, keep coming up. Ive been burnt out from my job, which is a whole thing in and of itself. Im on disability now though, so at least Im not thinking about it too much. But I almost wish I could be at work so I could distract myself. Ive also been struggling a lot financially. Living alone at 21 is insanely difficult, especially given the state of our economy and how much worse its getting, but I live in a one bedroom apartment so I cant get a roommate until the lease is up. Either way, I dont know how Id find one. Our political state doesnt help either, being a young, trans, queer individual. Im terrified. And right now I just feel like a complete and utter failure, as well as a terrible and disgusting person. I feel like with almost everyone Ive ever known this happens, where I put everything I have into our relationship, friend or now ex partner, and I never see that same effort given back to me. And they either leave me or just get more distant. Is there something like inherently wrong and terrible about me that makes people want to leave me, distance themselves from me, or not put effort in either? Ive been going to therapy for so long, and do my best to be as emotionally mature, healthy, and good with people I know, but I still feel so alone right now. I know Ive grown a lot as a person since I started therapy, and especially since I did DBT a few years ago. I know Im a good person, but Im never treated that way, which makes me doubt it more and more. I did my best to communicate with my ex boyfriend, but he never really put that effort in with me. I feel like no one except my mom cares. And I have hardly anyone in my life anyways. The one person who was in my life the most got so sick of me, he couldnt break up with me even over the phone, he did it over text. Like Im not even worth one phone call to tell me that. And him saying he only loves me platonically right now feels like another punch to the gut. How long was he hiding the fact he didnt love me anymore, and why did he wait until now? And if he really was thinking about it a while, couldnt he have done it some way that wasnt text? I just feel useless right now. All I can really do right now is process it and try to find distractions, but I cant even focus on any of my distractions. I cant even get myself to eat. I havent eaten anything today or yesterday, and Im still not hungry at all. I was already feeling pretty terrible the last week and a half, but now I feel like Im going to implode entirely. Im loudly sobbing in my room as I type this, and my cats arent even coming to see me. Which is another thing, it feels like they deserve so much better than me because my apartments messy and theyve gained weight. I feel like everyone in my life deserves better than me. I dont know who else to tell. Otherwise, Im entirely at my breaking point. My future and plans for this year have completely crumbled which is especially hard being autistic, hardly anyone cares about me, I cant do anything but be a lump right now, and nothing is dulling the pain at all. Im terrified and at a loss with what to do with myself. I just want this to be over. How am i supposed to manage this? How am i supposed to move on?",

    "text": "Married for 3 years, together for 7. When we first met we were both wild and in our late 20s. I got pregnant n dealt with some post partum depression. And around that time I started drinking heavily. Not pass out but definitely more than usual. I came to him and told him Im dealing with depression and I need help, so started going to aa meetings for support. Im not a full blown alcoholic I was numbing myself for the time, maybe I am an alcoholic. I had a slip up a year later with a mom friend and at that moment decided Im done drinking this isnt the life for me. That was 3 years ago. In those 3 years my husband will go to occasional coworker parties 2-5 times a year. But the last two times he came home drunk and drove. I vocalized about my concern of drinking and driving. My mom friend asked recently if I could come over n have a moms night. I told him we were going to have some wine then Ill uber home. So I asked my husband and he said absolutely not youre an alcoholic. I didnt fight him on it and said ok if youre uncomfortable I understand. We recently went to Japan and had a few drinks together and everything was fine. I didnt feel a need or even want to get that feeling. It was a huge step for me thinking wow I really am over this. Fast forward, he asked if this weekend he could go to a bar with some co workers. I told him no because he drove drunk two times when I asked him to uber. I feel salty that I cant even go to a friends house to hang out And do the same. if I cant then he cant either and its better that way.",

    "text": "Just looking to insight and peoples thoughts if possible When I was 30 me and a group of friends ofvarying age would go to a nude beach, one of the days a 19 year old came by and asked ot hang out with us. So from then forward she hung out with our group at times when we all went. I will say she did look younger in ways, and she was attractive and attractive body. I had no interest towards her sexually nor fantasized about her in anyway, nor aroused Nor did I want to be with her or do things to her. I also ended up following her on Instagram and such as we all became friends in that sense, I had likes photos she posted some of her body ect. years later I started a relationship with someone who dug through stuff when we started dating.. and found said perrson. Brought it up, I admit I addressed it poorly to start It has been talked about, and she continues to bring it up at times. All while at times implying I am a creep, a pedophile, that I want teenagers, that I couldnt find someone attractive without being aroused or turned on. When lve tried to reassure that I had no interest in this person that way, but my partner just.. fires away that I objectived her, made her feel safe while I was a creep in our group setting, I never personally invited said person to beach it was all my partner at the time because they hit it off and became better friends Iam struggling heavy that.. am I a creep/pedophile. lve never done anything towards a teenager, Ive never engaged with teenagers, I dont talk to teenagers or pursue them. My partner says one time I looked at a teenagers boobs while but which I had no recollection of happening when she brought it up. This has all made me doubt my self, feel digusted with myself, and question many things. Just seeking some insight and peoples thoughts from the outside",

Another was about his friend in Korea hooking up with women therehe said, as he should. And another mentioned blocking all the Asian women he sees on Instagram. These are just the ones I saw. Weve talked about it in depth, and I do believe hes sorry. Its been over a year since he said those things, but now hes stationed in Korea, and Im struggling with insecurity because of it.

He calls me my baby every night in bed when we are cuddling and also expressed how happy he is that Im staying over so often. A few days ago I was at his place, and when I was about to leave his apartment he said he loves me when I was already stepped out his front door. I was like hold on, that sounds weird. I couldnt say it back fully. Well, today after his work he called me and at the end of the call he expressed that he thinks I caught on on the fact that he switched from an i like you in his sentences and again told me i love you. And after my 3D still shows me lots of things I have to work on as you might already know my post history I dont know if I can believe him. Maybe he wasnt fond of my reaction towards it and wanted to make sure that I caught on? I was thinking of texting him an I love you good night message today so he can be sure of my feelings too",

She wants to revert our serious relationship to a casual one which I objected to and said we should break contact and just end things Do you think I should give the relationship another chance? Here is her last text to me. I you need to understand that this isnt about another person. I clearly should not be in any relationship especially while i am choosing to stay on the ship. The ship ruins many things, but yet, this is where i need to be right now. I dont know how long i still want to do this, and that is why I dont want to drag you along. I know i keep changing my mind about things, and it is not fair towards you. But we cant just wait till things work out. It just doesnt work that way. I respect your decision to then cut all ties. I will no longer message you. But please, if you do ever want to reconnect, please do. Even as friends. If that is even possible. I do care deeply about you and I do love you. I never lied about that. Unfortunately i am not as ready as you are to settle down just yet. I will probably regret not sticking with real love one day, but that is something i will have to live with. I cant force myself to be ready for something i am not ready for. It will juss end in a bigger disaster and much more heartache. Thank you for everything you have done for me and meant to me. You have gotten me through really hard times and i am sorry that i cant be the person you need me to be.",

    "text": "Ive had boyfriends before, but this experience was the worst and most eye-opening for me. Im a 24-year-old woman, and he was a 25-year-old man. Initially, he was charming and loving, and we didnt have any problems. I trusted him because we were friends for two months before dating, and I didnt see any red flags. So, I decided to say yes. We lived together, and I trusted him with our privacy and boundaries. However, I caught him messaging another girl, which was the first red flag. I confronted him, but he denied it despite my having read the messages. I forgave him, but I started overthinking because his behavior changed drastically. He would be sweet one moment and cold the next. As time went on, he started lying to me. I wasnt aware of his narcissistic tendencies at first, but as I endured more and more, I learned about narcissism through social media. His behavior fit the description narcissistic and possibly bipolar. I tried to understand him, but a part of me knew I shouldnt try to fix him because Im not responsible for his actions. He enjoyed playing billiards, and I supported him, but his daily outings werent normal. We would argue, and Id try to express my feelings, but he wouldnt listen. Instead, he would act like he cared, only to become cold again. It was like a rollercoaster, and I felt like I was playing mind games. I tried to talk to him, but I was afraid of confrontation because I knew hed twist my words and blame me. This was the worst experience of my life, and I felt depressed because of him. I even developed a gambling addiction as a coping mechanism. He also gambled online and would attack me about my addiction whenever he made mistakes. I became isolated, staying at home for months, and he knew I was depressed. The worst part was when he brought another girl to our home someone I knew. I endured it all, remaining calm, but every time we argued, hed threaten to leave, knowing Im emotionally attached to him. Eventually, he left me and the house. Weeks passed, and I thought I was finally free to focus on myself. However, he appeared again, like nothing had happened. I welcomed him back, hoping hed changed, but he just wanted intimacy and would leave again. I gave him multiple chances, but eventually, I tired of it. The last time he came back, I rejected him completely, and I saw him throw a tantrum in front of me before leaving. Thats when I realized theres no love he only loves himself. I know it hurts to feel used, but its like being trapped in a fairy tale. My purpose in sharing this is to help other women who might not know what narcissism is. They might get caught up in the love bombing and feel like no one can love them like that. But its not love its an illusion. However, Im not done yet. The last incident happened recently, and Im still dealing with the aftermath. Im concerned about my safety because he knows where I live, and I dont have the means to move. I want to focus on my problems, particularly my debt from online gambling, but its hard when hes still a distraction. My question is, how can I focus on my priorities when hes still occupying my thoughts?",

She grew up poor and told me education was the her only way out. And she made it. Shes killing it career-wise, her salary doubled this past year. At first I found her ambition really inspiring. Ive always admired how hard she works. I come from a more comfortable background. My familys well-off. I work at my dads company and have a lot of flexibility. Ive told her so many times that she doesnt need to push herself this hard anymore, that we could live a comfortable life even if she slowed down. But she always says she cant rely on me financially that she needs to have something thats truly hers especially a place in her own name. Lately things have gotten worse. She works for like 16 hours, barely eats, barely sleeps. I found out shes been using Adderall to stay focused and we fought about it. And then this week she had a heart attack. At 32. The doctors said if she doesnt slow down, she might not survive the next one. Shes in the hospital now hooked up to machines and looking completely exhausted. She keeps saying she feels like a failure. That no matter how much she earns she still feels like that poor girl inside.Shes agreed to see a therapist when she gets out, which is something. But even now, shes already talking about getting back to work and buying an apartment. Is there anything I can do to support her outside of therapy?",

    "title": "Hotel Employee Caught Masterbating on Bed, Holding my Shoe",
    "text": "Location: Beverly Hills, CA. While checking-in to a pretty fancy hotel, a male employee approached our group 3 females and offered to bring our belongings up to our room. We helped loading up the cart and thanked him. 15 minutes later, he arrived to our room and knocked on the door. We exchanged some small talk as we retrieved our bags He asked about our plans were during our stay.We told him we were going to a concert nearby. We asked him about working at the hotel and if he liked living in LA- that kind of thing. We thanked him and gave him a tip. Didnt see him again until about an hour later when we stepped into the elevator. He asked if we were excited about the show- to which we said we were and he exited the elevator before us on a different floor and we headed to the bar on the ground floor and hung out on the outside patio. About an hour later, we paid our bill and I went to the front to have a smoke while my friends headed to the room to start getting ready for the evening. On my way to our room, I was in the middle of responding to a text via voice memo when I overheard a males voice coming from the room I thought was ours. I assumed I had the wrong room and I started reassessing things when I heard one of my friends shriek from the same room, so I tried the key and entered the room. My friends were in an obvious state of distress and were panicking as we all watched the male employee in the room as he fumbled with his belt as he pulled up his pants. He was holding on to one of the shoes I was wearing when we arrived to the hotel. My bags were obviously sifted through, as my belongings were scattered about the room. There were some snacks and a bottle of sprite be brought with him on the bedside table. Next to a bottle of hand lotion.. He kept apologizing as we asked him what he was doing in our room. On our bed. With my shoe. He repeated no worries, Im sorry, no worries. He started coming up with an excuse, something about him must having the wrong room? Then his voice kinda tapered off and I said something along the lines of we know what you were doing. There are lots of worries. And we need you to leave right now- were going to call for management. He handed me my shoe, which was wet, and ran out of the room. As unbelievable as it sounds, I have audio recording from the interaction as I was recording a voice message as I entered the room. We did call management, we were placed in another hotel room for the night and told that the employee was tracked down and removed from the property. We were assured he wouldnt be allowed back on the premises. We filed a police report. Entered a lawsuit with the hotel. Attended therapy sessions. Gave our depositions. Which we each left feeling pretty violated. The defense attorney essentially blamed me for the situation- she claimed I was being too friendly and tipping too much- giving the employee the wrong idea. We lost the case, due to the hotel claiming they werent liable. They filed a movement for us to have to pay for legal fees. Were looking at about 15k. Am I crazy for thinking theres something wrong here?",

    "text": "My wife 25F is currently pregnant, underweight 46kg, anemic, has very low blood pressure, is constantly nauseous, dizzy, and fainting. She recently had to go to the ER. All her friends and family are 5000 miles awaywe live in the U.S., and theyre in Brazil. I 22M am her only support system right now. I also take care of our two dogs one is a puppy, cook, and make sure she stays safe at home. My younger brother 18M just graduated from high school, and my mom 56F is furious I didnt make the 300-mile trip to be there. It would have meant being away from home for an entire day or more. I told my mom Id be watching virtually and planned to send my brother a personal message afterward. She responded by saying I was making excuses and brought up how they once drove 8 hours in the rain to attend my graduation. She said theyve always shown up for me and that if I had a job, Id be away from home anyway. I explained that if I were working, I would take time off or at least be nearby in case of an emergencynot 300 or 400 miles away. On top of that, theres emotional baggage. At my own graduation dinner which was supposed to be a celebration, my mom and sister 20F created a lot of drama. They tried to embarrass me and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, even though I asked them multiple times to stop. Every time my wife spoke, my sister would whisper in my moms ear. It was extremely uncomfortable. In contrast, my dad and brother were kind and respectful. Ive asked my mom and sister repeatedly to stop this kind of behavior, and nothings changed. I didnt want to walk into that same dynamic again and risk another scene during my brothers big day. I genuinely wanted to avoid dramanot cause it. Alsowhen I graduated, my wife who was already sick tried to attend. She felt dizzy and fell on the way, hurt herself, and had to rely on strangers to get home. She ended up watching it online, and I never held that against her. I understand what real support looks likeand sometimes, support means showing up in the way youre safely able to. Ive made it clear I still want to celebrate himjust not at the expense of my wifes well-being. What are some ways to communicate my situation to my mom and help her understand my side without escalating tension? Ive already explained everything I wrote here to my mom, but it hasnt helped.",

The funeral was yesterday and i cant get it out of my head. Seeing her parents and her best friend and everyone else around crying and mourning, it was just too much for me. I held it as much as i could while i was there, but i broke down when i got home, i couldnt stop crying. Even today i cried my fucking eyes out. I dont know how to handle this, i dont know how to move on. Its just all these emotions coming at once and its just too much. Part of it is seeing all my classmates again and remembering the memories from the 8th grade and realising how much i missed them but i feel like that doesnt matter now. But still i dont know how to handle this tragedy emotionally. Its not just her death, its everything that happened at the funeral. It all hit me at once. Please help me",
