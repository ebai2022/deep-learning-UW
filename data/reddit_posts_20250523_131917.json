    "text": "My brother. Its just too complicated. For context i have two brothers and im the youngest 18F , my oldest brother has a very complicated relationship with mom. We all had trauma from my father but now my parents are divorced, they always fight. Like constantly. He always blames her for having this life and for marrying dad, every time his words are so sharp and the past argument he just told her to be gone and never come back. It really hurts mom and I know it because i was there I heard everything, he makes everything about himself and he plays the victim every time.mom didnt have choice when she was with dad he was violent and abusing for context On the other hand he treats me fairly nicely and he cares about me. But its never like how my middle brother treats me , my middle brother is on whole another level, he finished college , flew away to find a job, hes working in a company and he found the love of his life. Unlike my oldest brother who is stuck in the past and stuck to the drama and keeps blaming mom. I dont know how to act with my oldest brother, i feel like i cant hate him after all. But at the same time he had so many opportunities that he let go of. Im scared of talking to him and I dont want to get yell at so I avoid at all costs, even when they fight I dont interfere but at the same time I feel guilty like is there something the couldve done I didnt do?",

    "title": "How do i deal with my dad?",
    "text": "Im writing this in tears, I cant believe at 19 years of age, Im still enduring this shit. My mood has been ruined, despite having such a nice time with my mum before shit went down with my dad. What happened was. Whilst I was walking with my mum, I did that classic old iphone thing, where I was holding my phone and unknowingly disabled it for an hour. Yes, it was a silly mistake. No, it was no big deal but hey ho, shit happens. No big deal. As I came home, my parents got into a little fight, where my dad was annoyed with my mums tone and the fact that she got annoyed he didnt put the clothes out as requested and was just being a slob on the sofa. After that debacle, my dad saw my phone was disabled and i lowkey didnt want him to know. I guess subconsciously, I knew it would cause shit to go down. I was like oh yeah ahha no big deal though. I dont need my phone desperately or anything. And then I dont know what happened, but he literally started shouting at me, asking how I even managed such a stupid thing. I told him the truth, that my phone was in my hand, and I must have unknowingly pressed the buttons and I have the raise for wake setting on. He started saying I was full of shit, and that shouldnt happen, and started claiming I was lying. At this point, I was baffled but I know my dad, and I know hes a pathetic drama queen, So I was like ok If i say anything else, hell just go on and on. Then he left the room and came back - at this point my phone was stuck on 30 minutes and wasnt budging. He was like why is it stuck? LIKE IM THE CEO OF APPLE AND CAN PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION?? and I was like idk Im just waiting it out. Then he started screaming again, and told me to turn it on and off. Which I did, and it shot back up to 1 hour. I must admit, I said wow now look and I called the phone silly and he got super mad, saying I dont know shit, im full of attitude, I argue all the time mind you I NEVER argue with him, and i have no empathy. then out of half tears asked what did i even do wrong? and he was like you have no responsibility, ur just full of shit I stormed off to my room and then he started screaming more when he saw me cry. my mum backed me up, and he started arguing with her, saying we argue constantly with him and we need to stay in our lane and fix our tone. To which my mum said that hes speaking in an awful tone himself and then he basically told us to fuck off and this is the way he speaks. I literally feel bullied right now and over what? calling my phone silly. Yep What do i even do? What is my dad? a narcissist? I cant stand this shit",

    "text": "Hello, I will try to keep this short. I dont know how long I will keep it up, as my S/O is also on Reddit. I 21F and my boyfriend 21M, have been together for almost 9 months. We started off as friends about a year before dating and quickly began to like each other. Although we liked each other, I was hesitant about dating since I had some issues I wanted to work through and things I wanted to experience before dating. In fact I didnt really want to start dating until late 20s. We have had our ups and downs, but overall we are doing well. The problem comes in when I often and I mean OFTEN find myself contemplating this relationship. Yes I like him, but to me relationships are very serious and you should not be with just anybody. He also believes this, but doesnt seem to think as deeply as me about it. He is more like eh, we will figure it out when we get there. Which is true, but some things should be talked about before hand. We have talked about no children, money, jobs, living location, etc., and he is very committed to us. He makes it super clear that he wants to be in this relationship and has no doubts and wants to marry one day , and I feel really bad because I do have some doubts and dont know if I want to be together forever. I have this overwhelming feeling that comes, more often than I believe it should, about breaking up. It makes me really sad because he is my first boyfriend and I value the times we have together, but ever since we met something just felt missing. I admit that I liked him, but I was not ready to start dating. And before anyone says why didnt you say that?, I did. MULTIPLE TIMES. And yet he kept pursuing me, so I finally pretty much gave in and decided to give it a try. But I do sometimes feel as though I was pushed into it, as we have the same friend group and everyone shipped up together constantly. I get this in my opinion selfish thought that he is not doing enough to show me he cares about me, or that I dont like how he does something, or that I dont like how he says stuff, and just constantly nitpicking at the stuff he does, when in reality he really does try his best and try to keep up. I try to look at the good things as hard as I can but the feeling of something missing keeps coming back. I havent really wanted a relationship since I was a kid, so I dont know if that factors into it. I just dont know what to do or how to go about this. Does anyone have any advice on what to do or any type of validation for the way I feel ?",

    "text": "So heres the full story. I met this girl through a mutual friend. She specifically asked him to introduce her to a handsome guy who wont play her. We started talking, vibed quick, and had sex after a few days. Btw she is 17 and iam 18 Early on, she opened up about a lot of trauma she said she was raped, her ex burned her hair, and she had an absent father. I listened and respected it all, tried to be supportive, and never judged her. She also told me shed been with 17 guys before me again, I didnt shame her or make it a thing. I just wanted honesty, and she gave it to me. At least, thats what I thought. We were only talking for about five days when I found out she posted another guy on her story but hid it from me. I confronted her, sent her the screenshot, and told her straight up: hiding me doesnt help anything. She said he was just a friend. I didnt argue I just told her, Nice to meet you, and have a good night. Then I unfollowed her and never texted again. I didnt block her, didnt blow up her phone just stepped away. She hasnt texted me since. Its been about a week now. Then I saw a video on TikTok of her wearing the chain I gave her after all this went down. Now shes got that same guy from the story as her profile picture. So clearly, she moved on fast. But something about it still feels off. She told me she had just left a relationship 10 days before we met and had slept with a guy right before meeting me. Im starting to think I was just another rebound. Maybe I was just next on the roster. ALL OF THAT HAPPENED ON A SPAN OF A 2WEEKS Can anyone with any similar experience help me or tell me what the best to do",

After that, he continued to call me for a few days and we just talked for a few hours until going to bed. He seems to be interested in the things I do and on the calls hed compliment me and if wed interupt each other it would be No go ahead no you back and forth. Hes also asked about my future and hes told me personal info that he doesnt tell other people. At the time hed just gotten out of a relationship and said he wasnt ready for another one just yet, so Ive stayed back. He doesnt say much to me in school though. But, we will text randomly and Ive given him food multiple times and he is always excited when I bring it to him. Ive liked him on and off for a while, and I would like to ask him if when hes giving me compliments and stuff if hes flirting or if hes just being friendly. School is ending and I dont know if I should say something or let it go. He also sends me snaps of himself with funny filters and stuff. Does he like me or just being a guy friend?",

Then he said no its a gift from her. Whichever version is the actual truth, there is no receipt or paper trail other than some slip from the bank stating the w/drawal. Dont know bank name, dont know whose acct its from step dads, hers, a joint one?My concern is that since were married our assets could be at risk if theres some shadiness going on here. This seems VERY odd to me, as who just gifts that amount in cash? Why not a personal or cashiers check? My question is do I have anything to worry about potentially in future, like his mom or step dad asking for it back and saying that was not a gift or 10K? No we gave you 20K? If I DO have something to worry about what steps can I take to protect our assets?",

Im beyond stressed out and unsure of what to do at this point and no one in my life has been helpful of any advice. Before I had to quit my job in October, I had a credit score that was over 700, and currently my credit is sitting at 480 because all of my accounts have reported Ive not made any payments in over 150-160 days. What can I do in this situation?",

    "text": "Here is my story, I 18 yo white female. I used to work at a summer camp. One of the kids in my group was a little 5 yo African American girl. One day, while playing she got a leaf stuck in her hair, and it was to far in for her to remove it on her own so she asked me for help. I was about to remove said leaf, when my boss, 25yo African American female went in and yelled at me to NEVER touch a blacks person hair. I dont really understand, as I didnt mean to purposely touch the girls hair out of curiosity or anything, as I was trying to help. I tried to explain that I only meant to help the child and that said child asked for my help, but my boss almost told me to fuck off, telling me I almost did a hate crime and that I was racist, which I am ABSOLUTELY NOT. Do you know why I induced such reaction? I really didnt mean anything wrong, but I want to know if it is really me that did something, or if she overreacted and that its not that bad.",

I have spent the last six weeks in the hospital, the rehabilitation center and now the nursing home, all the while working with our attorney to help get finances in order, POAs filed, etc. And working my day job My mom is in pretty good health but did have a stroke a few years ago. I am the POA for both of my parents. Unfortunately Dads ongoing care is going to be expesnsive. I have offered to purchase my Dads truck at retail value to help put some cash in their pockets. They have another car and my mom does not drive any more. They arent destitute, but it wont take long to spend thru what they do have, provided Dad makes it thru this. Can the POA perform this transaction or do I need some third party yo facilitate? It sounds fishy even to me. Its certainly a conflict of interest in my mind. I am in no hurry to do this, and dont necessarily want the vehicle, but it will eventually be sold and I will be in need of a new car in the coming year. As cold as this post sounds, my heart and soul are dedicated to making my dad and moms last years happy ones. Thank you.",

The other night she went out and my roommate overheard her on a phone call and heard that she left to go cheat on me and called me to tell me. We talked about it the next day but there were a lot of emotions going everywhere so we didnt get that a far. A few days later she leaves me a note explaining how she really is so hurt that she put me through this pain and how she had planned to break up with me the next day and saw cheating as a way to make the breakup easier so she could be less attached to me. I can see how much she means it but obviously still hurts. If we had broken up regularly it would have been easier to be friends and I still want to be her friend but I dont know what to do. She wrote a lot of sweet things in the letter she wrote me that were very personal and I can tell she knows how much she hurt me. Would it be crazy for me to want to be her friend still?",

I admit I have not been perfect and ive done things I am not proud of and it has upset her for a good reason. one of the times the thing id done to upset her was i told her that i would talk to my friends very close friends about how i was feeling about everything that was going on. i wouldnt tell them everything but there were some major moments where I needed to be able to vent to someone. because of the moments I had told them about and how they made me feel, they have now been telling me that I shouldnt be with her. I have also talked to my therapist about everything more than what ive told my friends and he says the same thing. she has told me that what happens between her and I, should stay between her and I. which is bothering me because it is what my ex used to say to me because it would paint him in a bad picture to my family/friends after that moment, I kept everything to myself, the good and the bad. it was eating me up. the things that have upset me what I would tell my friends/therapist are things i have also told her. so I wasnt only telling outsiders what I was feeling/thinking without having told her about it first.",
