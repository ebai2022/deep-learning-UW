They originally met on Tinder and hooked up I think he said they had sex 2 or 3 times around 2019 and I guess their relationship eventually turned into a friendship. She really bothers me. I hate that my boyfriends best friend is a woman he met on a dating app and slept with. I also hate that he talks to her about us. Like, when we fight, he obviously tells her, and it just makes me feel awful that she knows all these personal things about our relationship. But when I ask him not to talk to her about us, he gets upset and says, Shes just a friend. I dont understand why youre so bothered by something that happened six years ago. And what I talk about with her is none of your business. So now it feels like my only options are to just tolerate it or break up with him. Any advice for me?",

    "text": "I16M have been a very emotional type of person for quite a while, dealing with anxiety attacks and SH pretty often, ive been someone who started to cry even on the thought of being without my girlfriend14F. Well for a while now, everything had been going downhill in my relationship, arguments, disagreements, and a lot of stuff, last night, my girlfriend finally decided to ask me for a break, saying that her mental health has really taken a toll and she needs some time, and she needs a break from all these arguments and everything, and she needs a break for about a week, which I accepted, and I let her take a break because as much as I dont wanna be without her, and I wanna stop her, I dont want to force her into being in this relationship while her mental health gets destroyed, but since last night, Ive just become emotionless, i cried once, had a few attacks since last night, but other than that, Ive just been emotionless ever since, and as for why she needed a break, she cheated on my in January for like 3 days but then she broke up with that guy because of guilt and how bad my condition got, and ever since Ive had trust issues with her, even though I accepted it, didnt end things and stayed with her, Ive still had a few trust issues causing me to be insecure of every guy, every thing, checking her chats again and again, well she found this quite toxic that Im not trusting her, and this caused a lot of arguments thus, she wanted a break, but is it normal that Ive become emotionless right now? After everything ended? Even though I was crying so much when I was with her on just the thought of losing her? Were in a long distance relationship, its been 11 months, and I love her very very much, but I dont wanna leave her, so Im very confused. And please dont say that we should focus on studies and career because we are, but we both love each other a lot, but she needed a break and I let her but Im confused as to what to do after shes back. Please help?",

    "text": "On May 7, I received a random payment of 32 and I figured it must have sent it to the wrong person but I didnt send it back immediately because I was worried it might be a scam and not real money that they sent me. So I looked up the guys name, found what I thought might be him on facebook, and sent him a message about it there. He never saw it or responded. Just now, I received a request for 33 from the same person with the memo sent payment to wrong person. Before sending it back, I checked the status of the payment hed sent me and PayPal has put it on hold so I dont technically have his money. I checked in my bank app to make sure and I definitely dont have it at all. I didnt realize at first that you are able to message someone on PayPal about a transaction, so in order to try to communicate with him, I tried to send him a 1 request with a memo explaining the situation and how I cant send it back yet since I never received it in my bank account. When I went to send that requestmessage, PayPal gave me a message saying you cant send/request money from yourself. try again. I figured it must be some glitch so I tried a few times and it said that every time. Now I poked around a bit more and found out I can message him directly on PayPal through his original transaction so Ive now tried to contact him there and still no response yet. But what do you guys think is going on? Is this a real situation or some kind of scam? Im weirded out that I wasnt able to send him a request for some reason and that PayPal thought I was requesting from myself each time. Is it possible that his account doesnt exist somehow? Im so confused. Thank you in advance for any advice.",
