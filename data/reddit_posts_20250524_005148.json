    "text": "i f23 wanted to have a chill night because my birthday is during the week and then i wanted to celebrate on the weekend so me and some friends just went for a happy hour and then were planning to go to a friends kickback later. but then my friend f23 got too drunk and had the idea to go to a sleazy bar that i really hate. she made me go to my house and change but then i was taking too long and she barged into the house and totally embarrassed me in front of my parents and their friend. then after in the car, i kept saying i didnt wanna go and just wanted to end the night at the kickback. she responded by saying stuff like they dont care if you go, they dont like you, i invited them out with us and they didnt wanna go so youre better off with us. this plus being embarrassed in front of my family and being forced to go to a bar just made me start crying because it just felt so mean. i have insecurities about not being wanted and she weaponized it against me so that she could make it about her and get fucked up at a bar. i still feel like shit. also, the car ran out of gas and we had to walk a mile to get gas for the car. i just dont know what to do. i dont want to lose friends and am a bit insecure right now but thats no way to handle a friends birthday. id never do that.",

I understand the legal side in India. Im not interested in the legal stuff. Not asking for legal advice My main challenge is: - How do I find and convince the first woman F 20s - 30s to accept and commit to this kind of setup with me ? - Has anyone done something like this, or seen it work in your family/community ? I would be truly grateful for any advice or suggestions, especially from senior experienced Redditors who have been married or in long-term committed relationships.",

Lately I felt jealous when she brought up other guys and said they were like me or if just kissed with someone. I decided to ask her out to see if there was any attraction or if I was just unsure of my feelings toward. She said she wasnt ready to date anyone yet. I took that as a no and we proceeded to act normally with each other. I texted her less cause I was busy with early shifts but checked in when I could. I just had a meetup with some girl friends of mine and she asked if I was on a date and I jokingly said yeah with 2 wifeys. She said I should be serious and I told her I met with my best friend that she saw the other time who is also a girl. She started acting weird and said I thought I was your best friend. I jokingly said yeah this is my real best friend. She got mad and told me to have fun and she will leave me alone. I told her I was joking since I made those jokes all the time but she kept insisting that the vibe had changed. I told her it hasnt because I still treat her the same way as before. I admit I dont jokingly flirt with her anymore cause I dont want her to think that I may have feelings for her. When she said she wasnt ready to date, I wasnt hurt or anything, just relief that it was not an attraction and I could keep being friends with her. Does it feel like I distanced myself or is she just acting jealous and weird?",

    "text": "So Ive f19 for a long time had an extreme issue with controlling my temper. I am often very blunt and dont properly consider how other people will react. Its as if my brain skips over one of the steps in understanding people, which makes me come off as quite cold, rude, harsh, etc, even though I dont mean to. I dont try to diminish my own responsibility here, btw, Im just trying to explain it from my own perspective. My family says I miss I get in a lot of arguments with my parents due to the way I speak I used to argue more with my peers as a kid with people, but managed to drop that come my teens, which leads to me being incredibly nasty and saying things I honestly dont mean. As a kid, I was more violent and Id hit myself and things, and a few times, my parents. Now I practice more restraint and mostly take out my pain on myself or isolate myself for long periods, however, I had a really terrible one when we went on holiday recently. My family went into town to go shopping, and I just generally found the town experience frustrating and unpleasant. I was pessimistic and rude the whole time as I was upset that my parents had no interest in planning our trip out to make it productive and exciting, but instead just wanted to mill around and look into one or two shops and leave. Theres nothing wrong with their approach, I just dislike going out without a clear plan as it makes going out feel disorganised, and I understand that pushing this perspective onto others is unfair and selfish. On the walk home, I started crying a little out of a vague frustration at all of these things combined, then at the fact that my parents were ignoring me. I threw my bags on the ground and yelled horrible things IN PUBLIC and felt supremely embarrassed and upset afterwards. I felt really selfish as I needed a day pretty much alone to recover from the matter because it made my brain feel really fizzy and sick. I describe an example of one of these because I got too much sympathy last time I posted on here ab these.

    "title": "i need the advice of others because my mind is torn its affecting my friendship. 19f",
    "text": "Im someone who usually takes the opinions of others very critically, and someone who has a strong moral compass. sometimes i get called dramatic for it, but i just want to do the right thing. especially now that i am an adult 19f, about to turn 20. i just finished my second year of university. with this being said, a lot is going on in my life and has been for a while. ive had struggles with family problems, mental health issues since i was a younger teen, and some dependency issues. i wanted to post about this situation i recently had with my friend 17m, because im having a hard time figuring out how to continue our friendship. weve been friends since 2020, and ive always believed that he was 10 months a grade younger than me because thats what he told me and our friends. from the end of 2024 to early may, we got really close. we caught feelings for each other, but i noticed he never wanted to start a relationship. he had a strong reason, and he always suggested wed lose feelings for each other. for a month however, he gave into the feelings he had and we got really close. i believe that i felt love for him. now, the problem is that hes 2 years and 10 months younger than me. not what i have been believing for literally the entire time ive known him. i always thought he was more mature than our other friends who are older, but i believed his little immaturities came from him being a year below me. now i see its a much bigger gap because he also is one grade below what hes supposed to be. so he will be a junior this year, not a senior. it makes me very uncomfortable to say the least. like very. when he told me i was in shock because at the time he was barely turning 17, and i am literally 19 years old. it freaked me out that he lied, and even though im not mad at him, i dont know how to continue. honestly, my friends said i should distance for a couple months but after 2 weeks this situation started to feel better for me and i was able to lose my feelings and become friends with him again. i wanted to keep him in my life. the problem is, i just feel predatory, and like im doing something wrong thats affecting our friendship. he noticed i talk a bit different, and im more careful with what i say. of course he doesnt blame me, but im afraid im going to ruin our friendship. i try to be honest with him with how im feeling, but i really dont want to say anything that could sound weird, or honestly, im more worried about the unintentional effects it could have on him. it makes me so nervous i feel like i shouldnt talk to him. obviously all my feelings arent fully gone yet and that also is a factor to why im super careful with what i say and wanted to get rid of all of them before becoming friends with him again. i wanted to make this post because honestly i dont think im being dramatic. even if the age gap isnt too big, the grade difference has me feeling like a whole child predator. people my age also feel strongly about age gaps like this due to the differences between a high schooler and a college student. i guess it is upsetting because i lost that version of him that i saw a romantic future with. and i dont think its fair or appropriate to have a hope that one day hell mature and well be able to try again. it makes me feel weird to think that. i guess im looking for any advice? anything opposing me, anything agreeing with me. or how you would handle this situation. im not looking to argue. if you read this far, thank you!",

    "text": "I 17f am the only girl of 6. I have three older brothers and two younger brothers. My older brothers all joined the military and left a long time ago, and now Im the oldest in the house. I want to do the same, but it feels like I cant. For context, my mother is a narcissist. Shes manipulative and will do anything to make sure that shes in control. Shes not affectionate and materialistic. I know that she loves us very much, but shes just so used to tough love that thats how she is towards us. I wont explain the details of what my siblings and I went through growing up, but I will say that it wasnt a very loving household. My dad is recently more affectionate, but he will always take my moms side in any matter. Even if were right, he will be on her side. Growing up, my parents fought constantly. It was like they broke up at least once a year. My littlest brothers were too small to remember, but I wasnt. My oldest brothers left as soon as they could because they knew how my mom was. Fast forward to a couple days ago. One of my brothers is having a baby and he had a huge fight with my mom over the phone. He laid everything out to her and told her exactly how much everything her and our dad did. He explained that they traumatized us and thats why their kids were leaving as soon as possible because they couldnt stay under their roof a second longer. Hes recently gone no contact with our parents and told me that if I choose to stay with them as an adult, he can no longer feel bad for me because thats what I decided to do. And thats fair, I agree. Now, Im 17. Im about to graduate and everyone is telling me to go to college. But if I do, Id have to stay with my parents. I want to leave, I want to join the military as an enlisted then go to OTS, but theres a small problem. My mom said that if I go to the military, shell never allow me back home. She didnt do this to any of my brothers, she just wants me to stay with her. My two younger brothers are counting on me to be with them. They havent seen everything and Im glad that they havent, but I dont know what to do anymore. I can either go to the military and build my life, simultaneously leaving them in the process, or I can go to college and stay home, losing my older brother as well as a life I could have had, but my younger brothers will be able to have me if my parents become too much for them. I know that I should put myself first. If I go now, I can make things better for myself. Ill be able to see my older brothers and build my own life. But Ill lose my younger brothers in the process. If I stay, Ill lose my older brother and Ill miss out on everything I could do. But my little brothers will have me. Im sorry if it seems like Im rambling, Im just really overwhelmed right now. What should I do?",

    "text": "At the beginning of my junior year, a boy started linking my Instagram pictures. I was really excited because Id always had a crush on him. We liked each others pictures for months. Sometimes he would stop liking them for a couple weeks and I would fall into a deep depression. Then he would start again and I would be over the moon. My friends warned me that he was a bad person and a drug dealer but I was so obsessed. I had the biggest crush on him even though I had never had a conversation with him. Then I found out he was taking to another girl. She was so perfect and so beautiful. I was depressed again and I felt so insecure. At the beginning he kept liking my pictures even when he was talking to her. Then I stopped liking his and I got so disgusted that he didnt stop. Then he stopped liking mine. I hated seeing him in the hallway and I hated even more seeing him with his perfect girlfriend. They are both graduating soon, but I feel so embersssed that I wasted my whole Junior year obsessing over a guy that never fully liked me. I feel ashamed and pathetic too because I know I was his backup plan. I hate how perfect his girlfriend is still and every time I see a picture of her I try to find flaws but I cant. I feel like Ive been sort of grieving for months, even though Ive never even spoken to him! I feel so pathetic, I wasted my whole Junior year, does anyone have any advice?",

    "title": "My F20 ex M19 just shared a disturbing story that feels manipulative. I need advice.",
    "text": "I dont even know how to process this, and I honestly feel sick. Im hoping someone can help me make sense of what happened. My ex texted me out of the blue and said, I lost my virginity. I dont know if I should tell you who it is youll think its weird. That already raised alarms. When I asked what he meant, he told me he lost his virginity and kept asking if it was weird. The way he said it sounded more like he was confessing to something strange than opening up about something painful. Then he asked if I wanted to hear the story. I didnt expect what came next. He went into graphic detail to the point that I felt genuinely disturbed and sick because I was still getting over him. He said someone close to him walked in on him and did sexual things. But he didnt react. When describing it, his focus wasnt on being hurt or violated it was all about how surprising or odd the experience was. He even said he froze, not because he was scared, but because he had never felt something like that before. Thats what stopped him not shock, not trauma, but physical sensation. Heck, he even mentioned he was turned on. So far nothing sounded like he actually didnt like the experience. He kept asking if I thought it was bad or weird, but not once did he say it hurt him or made him feel violated. It honestly felt like he was trying to see if Id react like he wanted to test if I cared that hed been with someone else. It wasnt until I replied plainly like theres nothing much to this story that he suddenly changed his tone and said he was panicking and then said it was actually forced on him. And that he needed my help really bad. That he needed emotional support. He still focused more on how bizarre it all was than on how he felt emotionally. I asked him directly if he felt violated, hurt, or angry. He said, I was just nervous. I asked again, and he said he guessed he was just shocked that it happened with the wrong person. Only after I told him that I had only stayed in the conversation because I thought something non-consensual had happened did he suddenly say, yeah, it did upset me. It just didnt feel right. The whole conversation kept shifting depending on what I said and how i reacted. And the fact that he was so detailed and emotionless in how he described everything made me feel like I was being manipulated. Its not the first time either. Every time I try to cut ties with him or go low contact with him, something dramatic happens. His health suddenly declines and hes lowkey on his death bed, or He gets kicked out or someones dying. And now this. It always happens when I start to walk away. Its happened too many times to feel like a coincidence. Now Im stuck with this awful feeling like Im doubting someone who might really have gone through something serious but everything in me says this wasnt a genuine disclosure. It felt reactive. Performative. Like a last-ditch attempt to keep me engaged. Almost like a classic case of crisis manipulation considering how often it has happened. I feel conflicted, also feel emotionally exhausted and grossed out. How do you trust your gut when it tells you something is off even when the story involves something as serious as trauma? What should I do?",

    "text": "My boyfriend 18M and I 18F have been dating for 2 years. He has always been a very sweet person, extremely polite, quite respectful for a teenager boy, yk? Never commented on my body in a lustful manner like he would absolutely adore the living shit out of it, compliment me, tell me how beautiful I look, or how sweet I am and etc the usual. But slowly as we progress, there have been few times where we have talked about intimacy etc, and it was perfectly fine but for some time I havent been feeling the best and i feel like he figured that out and has toned it down. Like doesnt necessarily compliments my body- just my face or my outfit etc. Now the thing is, I have quite the big tits- and that has been an insecurity of mine- and recently we were talking about this. Now he did ask my permission if he could say something but i did not expect what he did say. He said that sometimes he looks at my tits intentionally as he finds them attractive? Is it weird, that i feel a little uncomfortable by that? He has always made sure that my comfort is the priority but i just want to know if Im overreacting by saying that I feel a little uncomfortable. And how should I bring this up with him? ps: first time posting here so please excuse any error in the formatting or grammatical mistakes, thanku",

After some initial on boarding stuff, they set me up with a Mac which, at some point, was connected to my bosss iPhone, so a lot of the calender dates, photos, etc. are from his iPhone. So, as you would expect, a lot of the photos moved to this computer arent all related to work stuff and some private things accidently made it on there as well. As I was filtering through the downloads trying to find a particular image I needed, low and behold were some highly explicit images of various naked partners as well as photos/videos of him having sx with various partners. I was completely taken back because, while the images werent anything you wouldnt find in any amateur porn website, the context in which I found them was concerning. Where Im conflicted is, do I bring this up? Or is it water under the bridge? Just a simple, honest mistake? Im not judging his personal life at all, Im just mainly concerned that he would be so careless as to allow these images to make their way on to a work computer. In otherwords, Im less offended by the imagery itself its just porn for christ sake, nothing incriminating or harmful, Im just really concerned with the lack of professionalism. What do I do!",

    "text": "So pretty much as the title says. I have only had two other girlfriends before and I havent come across this situation before. So whenever my gf and I have sex Ive noticed that her down there has quite a strong smell which I never really minded to begin with. But lately Ive started to notice that I can smell her when we are just sitting on the couch, or driving and she uncrosses her legs. It is very distinctively a down there smell. Weve been together for a year and its getting progressively more noticeable. Now its not so much that I care about the smell, but I also dont want to be like hey did you know whenever you open your legs I can smell it because I feel like that would make her feel self conscious. Do I bring this up with her and suggest maybe theres an infection and maybe she should see a doctor? Or do you think shes already aware of this and I might hit a nerve? Really Im just after some advice on what I should do. Or if you are a girl in this situation, how would you want your boyfriend to approach the subject? TLDR my girlfriend has a very strong down there smell that I can smell in everyday, non-sexual situations. Do I tell her?",

    "text": "My sister F17 recently has decided that shed like to become a nurse when she graduates high school. Her main reason is for the money. I think shes taken what she sees on social media and believes that every nurse is rich. Ive talked to her about how nurses in our area are currently on strike because they are underpaid and overworked. That its not as glamorous as social media makes it seem. Im trying to help guide her, so that she knows what college she wants to attend or what classes she should take after high school. The issue is, she expects me to do all the work for her. She wont do any research. Throughout middle school and high school, shes asked me to help her with her homework and essays. She doesnt try. Ive had several talks and even spoke to my parents. I explained to them that Im a mom so I cant help with her school work and she should be able to do it on her own, but they baby her and expect me to do it. Ive finally taken a step back and no longer help her with school work. When I bring up college, she says Ill help her with her school work. I told Ive never gone to nursing school so I wouldnt be able to help. I suggested she speaks to her guidance counselor about her career goals and what steps she can take to prepare. I found a list of classes she would need to take from her school handbook. Two of those classes was Anatomy Physiology and Health Science. She was confused on why she would have to take those classes. She said she didnt want to study that. Which brings me back to my point. I feel like she doesnt understand what nurses do. I dont expect her to know everything or have everything planned out, but I feel like she thinks being a nurse is easy since thats what tiktoks show. I dont want to discourage her. If this is truly what she wants to do I support her, but I cant do the work for her and shes lazy. Shes said it herself The only reason Ive had these conversations with her is just to help her think about how she can prepare herself. Should I just continue to take a step back and let her figure it out on her own?",

    "title": "Fiend who kept my hopes up while fcking ex wants to remain friends",
    "text": "I am an 18 year old male, and my friend is 18 too. We already were friends 1 year before I started liking her, this second year. What are your thoughts, what shoul I do. Before December: I say I like her, I invite her to go out for lunch, she first accepts, then makes excuses and lies saying that she always said that we were just friends, and in the end, I end up apologizing for saying that because she didnt say anything, it seemed like she just wanted my attention. Before december I tell her I dont fell comfortable giving/reciving that much attention. During the December holidays, she writes me every day and shows interest in me, sending outfit photos...love bombs me. In January, she still does pick me things ex: taking my phone, asking if I have nudes , I say that since I swim I have private things. She then acts interested and asks for shirtless photos and then she says she likes me but that I talk about wanting to have a relationship right away and that it overwhelms her a bit. I ask her why she didnt tell me on december and she responds that she didnt want to get my hopes up whithout being sure. The following week, she starts acting like a pick-me again. In January, 1 week after telling me this,she starts having sex with her ex each fridaywith whom everything turned south, who is now her boyfriend for a few weeks. February puts her Leg on mine, asks me to sweep with my hand papers that are on her leg. I tell her that i like how pink gles on her her, she ruborizes and puts a pink jumper the very nex day. Keeps staring at me on class, queue for launch -on Valentines Day, she calls me 3 times to make sure Im coming to school, I give her a rose for Valentines Day, I say to her, pink doesnt just look perfect on Disney princesses, she calls me on WhatsApp and says thank you. doesnt mention anything about the topic or, of course, her boyfriend. - in the courtyards, she leans on me, bites my biceps, puts my hand on her leg near her ..., and draws hearts on it, I take it away and she puts it back. March: I tell her that I dont know how hes handling the situation, but that this closeness makes me uncomfortable, and if its nothing, she should stop getting so close. She denies it, minimizes it, gaslights me until I tell her that she bit my bicep. She responds with OK. and stays away for 2 weeks April: she keeps getting closer little by little, playfully bumps into me, pretends to trip me, makes jokes about the protein bar I have for lunch, saying it looks big to me, but not to her making penis jokes... She leans on me, looks at me in class with a dazed expression, looks me up and down, in the lunch line she looks at me from a distance. May: -I tell her that if she put on lipstick, she looks pretty, she turns red. -she leans on me A LOT in class, I move away and pretends to fall onto me, scratches my arm, takes my hand with excusesplaying with an eraser on my hand the teacher asks if we are having fun and she turns red. She keeps playfully pushing me, taking the opportunity to squeeze my arm. All the comments of teachers and friends didnt make her react. -I just found out about his ex/boyfriend now, she doesnt feel like talking in person and lasts 5 s in the conv. I write a long respectful text without mentioning the boyfriend she gaslights me, insults me , lies ex: :i told right away my friends that telling you I liked you was a mistake while her friends didnt even know about the ex until march or for ex, on january while she is already fcking her ex she tells them that she eants ro kiss me, what we would do if we were in couple She stil doesnt mention the ex. After 1.5 week of ignoring her she writes by e-mail, telling she is sorry. We talk in person and she says crying that , she didnt want to tell me that what she said on january was a mistake so that i dont get upset, that she never wanted to Hurt me , that she dindt know that It would Hurt me that bad , that she doesnt know why she acts so touchy or constantly reaching me ... I think it sounds like narcissistic apologies. After saying good by she and blocking her she writes by e-mail : She : If I didnt say it before, its because I wanted to avoid exactly this. Now I know I was wrong, Im sorry. She :The thing is, I need to talk, this time carefully following all your boundaries, and for that, you need to agree, and at the moment, you dont. I ignore her for another week She: I know you dont want to talk, and thats why I didnt want to send you this message. I know you dont want to talk, and thats why I didnt want to send you this message. But I dont like that we ignore each other or that it seems like we dont know each other. I have always valued your friendship because I like who you are as a person and I enjoy your company, and I wouldnt want that to be lost due to mistakes Ive made with you. If thats not the case for you, I would appreciate it if you told me so I can stop waiting for a conversation from you. Im very sorry that everything has come to this. Me: Wait for a conversation of mine about what? Her: About nothing in particular, a normal conversation between friends. I think she doesnt know I know that each friday, one week later after our conv, she ... A friend in common told me , but this friend doesnt want me to tell her I hnow it to avoid problems. What are your thoughts. For example, her being fcked each friday while i am emotionally available and she behaves in a way that didnt remediate this plus, overcomes boundaries because she s attracted to me, didnt say a real thing when I asked her how where things heading, or I send her a rose , doesn t inspire me a great honesty . What should i do, remain friends whitout giving her attention , ignore her , ignore hear telling her the ex thing other ideas...",

She meet them at her job. She wanted to go out because my parents had the kids and I had to work. We argued about it but she ended up going. Then I get a call from her while im at work asking me to come pick her up, I could tell she was really drunk and I was annoyed that I had to leave work to come get her. I told her I was coming but I didnt leave right away I stay to finish up the work I had i should have just left but I wasnt thinking I was still mad at her. But I got to the address about an hr later. I had to look for her because I didnt know anyone there and I didnt see her friends. Eventually I found her passed out on a couch downstairs not gonna go into detail about how I found her but it was obvious she was assaulted she was in no condition to consent from how she sounded on the phone I got her up and to the car I didnt know what to do so I took her home and waited for her to wake up. If I would have left work right when she called this might not have happened I feel like its my fault. She been In a bad way since this happened and im just looking for advice on how I can help her through this? I can give more details if needed? just message me anything will be helpful thanks.",

    "text": "So, Ive been alone my whole life, Ive always struggled to be social, Ive suffered from social anxiety since I was super little, since kindergarten or so, and never had any friends, never was invited to a party, never had anyone to talk to, never had anyone to play or share anything at all, so Ive always been at home and was able to find comfort being on my own. But recently this feeling of emptiness, darkness, void, has been haunting me, I dont find pleasure anymore in the things that I loved. I used to do all kind of activities on my own, that was no problem at all, but now I feel like Im missing something, I feel like I would love some company, but since I never learned how to socialice, its hard now that Im an adult. I used to be really really closed to my sister, now she doesnt talk to me since she got in a relationship, she doesnt wanna go out anymore and makes up excuses when I invite her same with my mom, shes doesnt go out unless its with her boyfriend, and they were the only social life I had, now Ive lost it all. Ive tried to make friends on the internet, but everyone seems to have their own groups already, they dont let anyone in, and I dont wanna keep feeling left out anymore, so I just let it pass. Im just worried because Ive never felt so blue like this in the past, I used to love my own company, but now this feeling of emptiness is consuming me. I keep my mind busy at work, I work full time and dont go to school anymore, and Im feeling really stuck right now, like everyone has at least one friend, one contact to reach out, Ive got none. Any tips or advice helps",

    "text": "I 32F just told my husband 34M that I have a 13-year-old son back in my home country, and now he wont speak to me. I hid it out of fear and shame. I dont know how to fix this. Throwaway because my husband and some friends use Reddit. This is not a post I ever thought I would make, but Ive hit a wall and really need advice. Please be kind. I know I made mistakes, but I also didnt feel like I had many choices at the time. Im originally from a conservative, rural area in Southeast Asia. In my country, especially in the region and community I grew up in, getting pregnant outside of marriage is not just frowned upon, its considered a deep stain on your familys name. The word shame doesnt even begin to cover it. Girls in my town who got pregnant unmarried were sometimes disowned. Some were forced into marriages with abusive men. A few just disappeared, moved away, sent into hiding, or worse. In some extreme cases, there were whispers about honor-based violence. One girl in the next town over died under uncertain circumstances after her pregnancy was discovered. Everyone knew what that meant. So when I got pregnant at 19 by someone who had no interest in being a father, my parents went into damage control mode. We told the extended family I was sick and sent me to live with an aunt in another town until I gave birth. My son was raised by my parents as their own. I was told, lovingly but firmly, that I needed to move on, build a future, and keep this part of my life private forever. I didnt argue. I was scared and ashamed and young. A few years later, I got a scholarship to study in the U.S. I left. I told myself it was for him, that Id work hard, send money, and one day maybe find a way to bring him here. And I did. Ive supported him financially ever since. I call regularly, I visit once a year. He knows Im his mom. He calls me Mama. But no one in my American life knew about him. Then I met my now-husband. Hes American, open-minded, kind, supportive. Weve been married for three years. Hes never been to my home country and doesnt speak the language. Hes asked a few times about my family, but I always gave vague answers and told him my parents were traditional and private. He never pushed. I never told him about my son. I wanted to. But I was terrified. Not just of losing him but of everything it would mean. I told myself it was too late, that Id tell him eventually. But eventually never came. Until last week. I finally told him the truth. About my son, about my past, about everything. I told him I was sorry, that I was young and afraid and that I was trying to survive the best way I could. He didnt yell. He just said, So I never really knew who I married, and walked out of the room. Since then, hes barely spoken to me. Ive been giving him space, but Im afraid Ive ruined everything. I dont blame him for feeling betrayed. After all, I did lie by omission. But I didnt do it out of malice. I did it because where I come from, my sons existence could have cost me my life. I want to fix this. I want to be honest going forward. But I also understand if the damage is done. TLDR: I come from a very conservative culture where having a child outside of marriage is dangerous. I hid the fact that I have a son from my American husband for years. I finally told him, and now he wont speak to me. I dont know how to earn his trust back or if its even possible.",
