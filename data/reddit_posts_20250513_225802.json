    "text": "He and I have been married previously. He was married for twelve years. I was married for around two years the first marriage. The second marriage was around three years about fifteen years ago. His marriage ended about two years ago. He nor I had any children. I had my tunes tied for a lack of a better word at the age of thirty-five. We agree to no children. We agree to no marriage. We agree to spending the rest of our lives together. What is our thoughts about our situation? Do you feel we might be missing a part of life as in the traditional family life or anything else? What is our thoughts about what to do with all thos extra time and money? I mean money as in a very humble amount. Are there any couples out there that live this way? If so, what so you do to pass the time? How do you deal with those that keep pushing thier agenda?",

Im not able to afford therapy, so thats why Im turning to Reddit, and Im honestly not sure if asking people around for advice is still in that same trope Ive worked in offices where Ive tried to avoid people, or even try to keep all conversation focused on them or even with passing conversations, but that doesnt seem to work, or Im told that, I seem to be lost in my own world. Is there any advice that you might have to make a proactive approach to change?",

    "title": "I 29F am absolutely terrified to get into another relationship after my ex-fiance 30M broke up with me almost 2 years ago",
    "text": "I was previously with my ex for almost 5 years, and we got engaged after 4. We started dating at the beginning of 2019 and he broke up with me at the end of 2023. Everything was going so well in our relationship until the end of 2022 when I got really sick and started gaining weight after being put on medication I will not be including health stuff here. One morning before I was heading to a doctors appointment, he broke up with me. I was completely blindsided. I knew we had hit a rough patch, but had no idea that he was even thinking about ending the relationship. He left to go to his parents house but I called him back and asked him to come talk it through with me. Once he came back to our place, he unloaded on me. He told me that I had gained too much weight in the last couple months, he was embarrassed to be around me and have his friends see me in public, and told me our lives didnt mesh well together anymore since I had gained weight. He also shared that I was just too depressing to be around since I got sick and he didnt want to get married to me and have to be a caretaker for the rest of his life. He also said he felt anger towards me because I finished my masters before him, have a remote job, and made more money than him he worked in-office and made about 30K less than me back then. When he told me all of this I literally had no idea he felt all of this contempt towards me. He was sharing all of this and I was in shock. I couldnt comprehend that my closest friend and the person that I thought I would be spending the rest of my life with had felt this way about me in secret. Also - heres another kicker - he said he was feeling this way while we were planning the wedding. He said nothing when we picked our venue, booked florists, DJs, caterers, photographers, etc. I even paid for my custom wedding dress in full. Absolutely no hint from him that he was even considering breaking up with me. He broke up with me 6 months before the wedding Looking back towards the end of our relationship in 2023, he stopped wanting to hang out with me, starting sleeping in our guest bedroom, and even starting going out on weeknights and weekends with his friends and not inviting me things we used to do together. And quite honestly, he started getting emotionally and verbally abusive towards me as well. Telling me to stop eating, asking me to download a calorie tracker app, and berating me in front of friends and family. He even convinced his mom to gift me workout classes for my birthday. Now, here I am almost 2 years later and I am absolutely TERRIFIED to even start dating again. I wont even download an app or message people. I know that I am better off without him and in NO way do I wish we were together, but I am so scared to start dating again. I feel a sense of panic whenever I even think about going on a first date. I have been in therapy since even before the breakup and even with conversations with my therapist Im having no luck with a breakthrough. Working through this breakup was extremely difficult. I am moved on from the relationship, but so scared of the possibility of another one. I quite honestly feel like I will be alone forever. I feel stuck. With everything that happened I feel like I cant trust myself to get into another relationship. I know that the ending to my relationship isnt the worst out there, but it messed me up really bad mentally. I know that every relationship is unique and every breakup is unique, but I was hoping to get advice on how to build up confidence to put myself out there again. What can I do to build up my confidence and make sure I am the best version of myself for the next relationship? Any advice on how to trust someone else?",

    "text": "I never thought Id be posting here, but I could really use some outside perspectives on this situation. Recently, at my brothers graduation party, his girlfriend was handing out stickers. She gave my friend a college-themed sticker, and then she carefully selected a tiny heart sticker and placed it on me. I was a bit surprised, expecting a similar college sticker. My girlfriend and I both responded with an aww at the time. My girlfriend watched this happen and waits for her sticker right next to me but she walks off. A few days later, my girlfriend told me that this gesture made her feel jealous and uneasy. She also mentioned another incident where I was telling a story that had everyone laughing, and she noticed my brother tapping his girlfriend on the shoulder and making a face, as if to say, It wasnt that funny. I have ADHD and possibly am on the spectrum, so I often miss social cues and signs of flirting. To me, these incidents seemed innocent. I respect and love my brother and his girlfriend, and I cant imagine any inappropriate intentions. My girlfriend has CPTSD from a previous relationship, and while our relationship has been amazing, she hasnt shown much jealousy until now. She acknowledged that I shouldnt bring it up, but wanted to warn me to be cautious so nothing bad happens. She does have a history of hyper vigilance due to PTSD. Im trying to understand her perspective, but I also feel that these concerns might be overreactions. I would appreciate insights, especially from womenwould such gestures make you uncomfortable? Am I overlooking something here? TLDR: My girlfriend is upset over my brothers girlfriend giving me a heart sticker and laughing at my story. Im unsure if this is irrational jealousy or if Im missing something. Seeking advice and perspectives.",
