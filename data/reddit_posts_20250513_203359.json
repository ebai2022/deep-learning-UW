    "text": "Hi everyone, my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, Im 21 F and hes 21 M. Weve had a wonderful relationship and he is a fantastic man who possesses all the qualities I could ever hope for. The issue is, is that hes in ROTC in college currently and has goals for becoming a combat engineer officer in the army and has another two years graduating late before he graduates and after those two years he basically goes to another training school for 5 months and then will receive orders to leave for base. Essentially around three months ago he asked me to go with him when he gets stationed implying that he wants to marry me before he leaves. This was initially a lot to take it and lead me to really think about whether I wanted to marry him so soon, and I already saw myself marrying him prior so decided if I had a foot in the door career wise have a promising internship with high chances of employment after graduation with high likely hood of remote work I would go with him and we would get married. I brought up marriage around a month ago as I realized we didnt have much time before then and he essentially told me he was ready for the marriage commitment and that we should enjoy the time we had together. This was super rattling for me and essentially made me question everything bc I am somebody who values commitment EXTREMELY. After that conversation things havent really been the same, not in a bad way necessarily but its clear there is some lingering tension. I called him tonight and asked him what was going on and he essentially told me that marriage was scary and that he wasnt sure if he was ready to commit to something so young. I told him he has until December of this year or sooner to let me know but honestly Im pretty heartbroken and am feeling like there is no way out of this but to leave. I understand where he is coming from but am thinking in my head that if hes unsure now that hell be unsure forever. Genuine advice is appreciated and to be clear I really do love this man but would like some outside insight, I give him until Christmas to sort this out or do I make the decision to leave? He is adamant that he loves me and wants to be with me Im aware they all say this but I do truly feel like this is the truth, it just seems like hes really struggling with what the right thing to do is.",

I just bought a pc and the first thing they said was you better make music with me and I said yeah, havent gotten everything set up yet, and am excited to buy music software. We can totally collaborate for sure. They took offense that I said the word collaboration rather than doing something wholeheartedly together. I get it but I also what my own individual music experience, and not a Paul and John situation around the breaking up of the Beatles. Im just wondering if anyone has any advice on this, because I wanna solo artist and collab without my friend clinging on to every aspect of the process, or at least learn how to set those boundaries and cope with this anxious feeling I have.",

    "text": "Ive been debating whether to post anything about this but I cant stop thinking about it, so here we go. Im early 30s F and have a huge crush on someone at work. Hes about 10 years older, and I would never in my wildest dreams even think about pursuing something with him, except....I feel like hes been flirting with me for the past several months. It started with looks and long awkward eye contact. Then a couple of months ago, he made a slightly inappropriate comment to me at work. I absolutely did not mind, told no one about it, and actually had a confidence boost from it...till he later apologized for having said something he really shouldnt have. I was almost disappointed, but also really respected his approach and apology. I went on with my life but we kept having these awkward interactions. A few weeks ago, I was getting ready for a road trip and just generally thinking about my life and how Im ready for the next chapter. I decided to finally make a move after an exceptionally tense moment between us and messaged him through our work teams app and said, Im about to leave on a trip but I would love to get together for coffee when I get back so I can get to know you better. I immediately regretted sending the message, but he responded about a minute later and said he loved the idea. He then said that my timing was really curious, because he just left something for me and my team at my desk it was a puzzle, which we all love. We messaged back and forth for a bit that night, then I left for a road trip the next day. The first day I was back in the office, I messaged him and asked if he could meet for coffee. I didnt hear back for a few hours and when he did respond, he said it wouldnt work out that day. I said thats no problem, lets plan on some other time. He reaches out later that day and says, what about tomorrow, I should be free at 11? I said yeah, lets do it! The next day, I dont hear from him till a bit later and he says I finally have some time, if were going to do this we need to do it now. I dropped everything I was doing, met him downstairs, and bought him a cappuccino. We talked for almost an hour till I had to run to a meeting. I thought it went great! He touched my leg at one point, seemed very focused on me, stood/sat close to me, studied me up and down, etc. We get back upstairs and a manager is standing in the hallway like a fucking weirdo, so we say bye and go our separate ways. He reached out shortly afterwards to thank me for the coffee. I said absolutely, and heres my phone number because Id love to do it again. He texted me immediately, and we messaged back and forth for a little while that night. He texted me again a couple of days later, we again chatted and joked for a couple of hours and it was amazing. I asked him what his work schedule is, gave him mine, and told him that he can ask me to hang out any time. I havent heard a peep since about a week ago. Ive been sincerely questioning whether I misread the signals all along. Im obviously not averse to putting myself out there, but I need encouragement just as much as the next person. Especially with someone who is a decade older than me and presumably has more relationship possibley even marriage experience than I do. Did I not try hard enough? Have I tried enough and just need to wait for him to make a move? Is he just not into me and is maybe just looking for some attention? Our conversations have been super fun and lighthearted, though I think Ive dropped a couple of flirty hints in there to make my intention clear. What would yall do in this situation?",

    "text": "Every year that passes, I am more and more embarrassed at the mes that have come before. Im 21 so I understand that this embarrassment is proof of growth and also inevitable. But... does it ever stop? Its kind of exhausting to be embarrassed of who I was all the time... But I am just consistently embarrassing and cringey. Genuinely. I am known as the weird cousin, the quirky friend and even the crazy ex girlfriend in some cases. Not great titles to have, but admittedly deserved. Maybe it all comes with the territory of being a late bloomer and that lateness is infecting all of my life. Who knows. All I know is its really, REALLY, inconvenient. Late puberty was tough enough. Does this end? Am I just going to have to live in constant fear of the judgement that comes from my future self? When does everything about me stop being embarrassing?",
