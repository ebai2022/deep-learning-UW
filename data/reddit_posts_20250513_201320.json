    "text": "Hi everyone. I recently posted on am I the a about a situation where both my friend and I applied for and received a competitive scholarship. Since applying, shes been upset with methough she hasnt said anything directly. Ive since learned from other friends that she feels I didnt need the scholarship as much as she did, and that I shouldnt have applied. Over the past semester, shes been increasingly cold and passive-aggressive toward me. She snaps at me in conversation, ignores me, makes plans in front of me without including me, and leaves class, lunch, or afterschool activities without waitingI always wait for her. Its only recently that I connected her behavior to the scholarship. Two friends have confirmed that shes frustrated with me over it. While Ive come to terms with the fact that I didnt do anything wrong by applying I have my own reasons, including uncovered educational costs and long-term opportunities, Im completely lost when it comes to how to handle the social fallout. This wasnt just one friendIve realized that my whole friend group, who I considered my closest friends, seems to have also believed that I was in the wrong for applying to the scholarship. Ive been gradually distancing myself the past two weeks, partly because of testing, but also because the atmosphere has become unbearable. Now, in my last week of high school, theyve fully stopped sitting with me at lunch. During lunch, they have sat away from meI know that at this point they are silently telling me to go somewhere else but I truly have no idea where else to go, they have been my closest friends these past years. I dont need closure from themIve accepted that this is a friendship breakup. But its incredibly painful to go through during whats supposed to be a joyful, celebratory week. I feel isolated, and I honestly dont know where else to go during lunch/class or how to keep my head up until graduation. If anyone has advice on how to get through this last week with some dignity and peace, Id really appreciate it. Thank you all for reading this far.",
