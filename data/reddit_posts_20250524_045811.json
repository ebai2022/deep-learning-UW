    "text": "Weve been dating for 5 months, and for the most part, things were going well. But my perspective changed recently when I caught her in a lie and instead of coming clean, she kept lying when I confronted her. One night, I was out to dinner with my family and she texted me that she was going to sleep early because she was tired from school. I believed her at first, but I had a gut feeling something was off. We both use Life360 a GPS tracking app so we can check on each others safety. I noticed her phone showed as being in her dorm and charging but I know she usually brings her phone everywhere. Acting on instinct, I called her dormmate and asked if she was really there. Her dormmate told me she wasnt she had left her phone charging on her bed and gone out. At that moment, I felt shocked and betrayed. I confronted her through chat. She only replied 2 hours later, confirming that she had gone out and left her phone. She said she lied because her friend was having an emotional breakdown and she didnt want to worry me. She knows I dont like her going out at night because her city isnt very safe. When I asked for proof, she sent me a photo of her friend with a timestamp but it turns out she edited the date/time using her iPhone. She admitted this when I pointed it out and said she just didnt want things to escalate. She also admitted that she had no other proof she was with her friend during those 3 hours. I decided to break up with her. Not just because of the lie, but because she doubled down and tried to manipulate the situation instead of being honest once she was caught. It made me question everything. I still love her, but I dont know if I can ever trust her again. I feel conflicted. Did I overreact? Was breaking up the right decision? Any advice is welcome.",

    "text": "A few nights ago, I had my first sexual experience ever. Ive never even kissed a girl before this. I was driving through Greenfield Avenue in Milwaukee and saw a woman who looked like a prostitute. She wasnt dressed like oneno heels or revealing clothesbut I could just tell. No woman just stands at a corner like that without trying to cross the street. I pulled up and asked if she was working. She said yes, and I said something like, Lets do it. She told me to go somewhere private, so I turned into a neighborhood and parked. She said she charges 40 bucks for everything, which surprised me, but she looked kind of like a crackhead, so maybe thats why it was so cheap. We got in the back, and she started by giving me a BJ without a condom. After about a minute, she asked if I was ready. I said yes, and she laid on her back with her knees up. I was kind of hoping shed give me a condom, but she didnt, and I wasnt going to say I couldnt do it without one. So I went in and finished inside her after about two minutes. Its been three days now and I feel completely fine, but Im starting to worry. What should I do? Im 17 and dont have much money for HIV treatment or anything serious like that. I heard stuff like chlamydia or gonorrhea is curable, so Im less worried about those. But what are the chances I actually caught something serious from a street prostitute? I used ChatGPT to help fix the grammar and make this readable, so if it sounds AI-generated, thats why. Video nothing graphic, just audio: https://imgur.com/a/NVQ9BmA",

    "title": "My 33M GF 35F of 4y wants to separate and open the relationship while moving to another country for 3-12 months. What is your experience and did the RS had any future after opening it?",
    "text": "Its been a bit of a rollercoaster with this one. The first half year of our relationship, we obviously had the honeymoon phase and everything was perfect, and it was the best time we had together. Started going downhill from then got a super high energy and demanding dog/puppy back then with separation anxiety. Lost the freedom and passion that we had at the start and decided to move to a different city to combat the routine we found ourselves no more spontaneous dates, travels, events longer than few hours etc. basically staying at home 24/7 to cater to the dogs needs and health. Moved to another city got new jobs were busy with life, worked on the dogs separation anxiety and the relationship went upwards again but the passion/desire for intimacy from the first half year was never regained. To combat the lack of lust my GF tried getting off the pill. We tried a lot, talked a lot but the fire in the bedroom department was never rekindled unfortunately. During our stay in the new city my GF got to be friends with one of her female colleagues who was quite the advocate for open relationships. They began hanging out 2-3 times a week. Since weve never regained the spark of the first few months of our relationship my GF started suggesting to open the relationship which was quite a dealbreaker for me back then. I told her that if she wants to open the relationship then we might as well break up, since Ive never heard/seen of couples that stayed together if one partner had to be convinced to this style of relationship. Since she didnt want to end the RS she didnt bring it up again. We tried talking again tried different stuff in the bedroom, going on vacations, dates etc. but nothing really worked to get the engine started again so to speak. This went on for one more year. Since then we had quite a few quarrels and struggles finding the right dynamic. She took some time out, lived alone for 3 weeks and went on one vacation by herself for 2 weeks but always decided to not end the RS. Because of a job offer for me we moved again to a different city. She never got accustomed to this city and never found friends here, so she basically stayed 24/7 at home also working from home. Since my job sucked quite badly and she was fed up with staying at home and also having to take care of the dog most of the time we decide to move back to her hometown where we met after only having lived here for one year. Back to Family and old friends and stuff. During the past few months she mentioned she would need a break from the RS again and would be trying to apply for a work and travel visa for Canada. Mind you we live in Germany. Shes done the WT back in 2015 for a few a months and really fell in love with the country and the people. She applied and got the visa and would now like to leave in July. Weve already been separated location wise since the beginning of May since I still have to stay at my job until the End of June and she is staying in her hometown reason was the cancellation date end of April of our apt in the current city. Now shes thinking of having an open relationship during her stay in Canada which might go on for 3 months, but could also go on for 12 months if her funds allow it. She said she needs to validate her feelings and see if shed appreciate the RS more if she knows she cant get it back for a few months. I already told her that for me the RS is pretty much over if she really goes to Canada, but on the other hand I cant bring myself to really end the RS since part of me still loves her and thinks the world of her and wants to have a future with her. We are meant for a follow up talk tonight. TLDR: Girlfriend of 4y wants to work and travel to Canada for up to a year and wants an open relationship during her stay to validate her feelings towards the relationship and rekindle the love of the beginning for the RS.",

They own multiple pitbulls possibly type 1C, kept in a tiny area, never walked, and constantly stressed. One of the owners is actually a veterinarian, yet the dogs are left to bark all day and have become highly aggressive. There is no upper fencing. My cat stood no chance. She was killed instantly. She wasnt just a cat she was rescued after someone in my family took their own life. She was the last living connection to that person. I need advice specifically for Brazilian law. I have photos and witnesses. Can I hold them accountable for failing to contain dangerous animals?",

A manager resigned and I was handed over almost 50 of his work, then another associate was transferred to a different role and I was given 40 of the work. I asked my my manager to officially hand over these responsibilities, so they are documented. I have been over working for almost a year, without a pay raise. Now, when I have completed a year, instead of giving me a raise or a better job title if not promotion, hes hiring a senior finance associate who I will train and let him do the work I have been doing for a year. Reason? I am not a qualified CMA and have few exams left and they are hiring a senior associate just one grade above me who will do the same plus some additional work that I have been made to do despite being under qualified for that job role. Im losing my mind and do not want to continue and just take a break to focus on the remaining exams. I cannot go to work with the resentment everyday.

It was just a fetish and I got exposed when sober I have no interest in them emotionally. Ever since my social proof was destroyed. Cis women no longer want me and I had a healthy sex life 2-4 women a year. Do you know what the mods say Boo fucking hoo. Trans people are murdered everyday simply for existing. Do you expect this community to feel bad for you because you couldnt keep your fetish for chicks with dicks in your pants? Get real. They say this to a former suicidal guy who lost his whole life how unprofessional. Im in a rage. No one likes a man like me not the gays, not the straights, not the outcast passport bros. Im the type to be shunned and silenced and forgotten since I didnt follow the unwritten rules Im sober I dont see trans women anymore. I have family members and community members who commit robberies who are loved dearly romanticised . But one thing off norm its over. But Im not naive to how society works its conform or die. Im so lonely",

    "text": "So I recently found out that Lexington Law is involved in a lawsuit and theres supposedly a payout for former clients. I used them for a few months back in 2021 and definitely paid upfront fees, which Ive now learned might have been illegal under the law. Im seeing posts saying people are getting checks in the mail, but no one seems to know how much the average payout is per person. Is it like five bucks or something more substantial? Im not trying to get rich, I just want to know what to expect. If you already got your check, how much was it for? And did you have to do anything to claim it or did it just show up?",

She included screenshots and pictures and there is no doubt he cheated. She also messaged our grandma and his mother in law but they havent opened the messenger messages. I called him and told him about it. He tried to deny it at first but then admitted it. He doesnt want me to say anything. For context my wife and his wife used to be good friends but had a major falling out a couple years ago and havent really spoken since. My wife wants to tell his wife but Im torn. When I spoke to him he was embarrassed and remorseful. I told him he should tell her himself but he txt me earlier and said the mother in law and grandma never opened the messages so he doesnt know what to do. I told my wife if she wants to reach out to her and tell her what happened I will have her back but I really dont want to go through another major fight with my family.",

I want someone to share my life with, someone who understands me, and someone I can build a future with. Its tough being single when it feels like everyone around me has found their person. Im trying to focus on self-improvement and hobbies, but sometimes it feels like Im just going through the motions. Has anyone else felt this way? How did you cope with the loneliness and stay positive? Im open to any advice or words of encouragement. Im open to accepting DMs .",

    "text": "Does this make sense to you? Im trying to draft out why I delete messages, the person I am seeing is poly and lives with his partner, my mum had a heart attack this week and things have felt tough in general and often I send light hearted messages, realise its likely a night they are having together and I delete.. Eeek yes, classic me, the disappearing message act. It seems I tend to do that when Im feeling off, full of the bads, and not regulating things very well. This week hasnt felt good general floating-in-sad-lonely-space worry feeling, and Ive been trying to brave-face it, but yesterday felt especially hard. Sometimes I send something from a place of wanting connection, then when I start to sense the quiet, I imagine the other person mid-wholesome evening crafting, film-watching, having the best cuddle or more, or just needing space and I do a little panic. It suddenly feels like one of those nights where I should shh and let space exist without me in it. So I delete, like maybe I can take back the exposed feeling too. Its probably a weird mix of self-protection and magical thinking. Even though I know you mightve already seen it and deleted messages are their own kind of loud sorry, in that moment it feels like the least disruptive option. Its not about causing drama or being difficult just a slightly scrambled attempt to not feel alone while also not intruding on someone elses joy. Like: I gone now, it oks. Anyway, not a crisis or trying to be heavy just an attempt at explaining me being a squiggly, wriggly human with the goods and the bads. But I will keep trying to wind down the ghost-text era, one tiny spiral at a time and just sit with the discomfort instead.",

    "title": "why does my 23F boyfriend 27M not want to split rent while basically living with me, if he makes 3x what i make?",
    "text": "my boyfriend and i have been in a long distance relationship for a year and some change. he has visited me a handful of times but i have not yet visited him at his house, as he has a remote job making 150k and i work an in-person social service job making 50k and have limited pto. he lives rent-free and has very few bills whereas i live with five other roommates and have little disposable income. it has been difficult for him to visit me as i live with so many roommates and he prefers to stay for at least 2 weeks at a time, which i dont think my roommates are incredibly comfortable with which i understand. he also previously shared the sentiment that he prefers not to visit me for short periods of time, as it is emotionally difficult to leave, and he was not willing to pay for his own place to stay hotel, air bnb, whatever as it can be so expensive to stay for long periods of time. my lease ends in august, and we had developed a plan where i found a subleaser for my current place, i would move into my own one-bedroom would cost roughly around 1-1.2k, which is the least you could pay for a somewhat liveable apartment in my city. then he would be able to stay with me for like a month at a time over the summer until i met his parents over the summer and then he moved in with me in the fall. however, i have spent the last three months independently attempting to secure a new place and find a subleaser for until my lease ends. this has been somewhat grueling, as i have had very little people be interested in renting my room and if i found a suitable subleaser they would flake/plans would fall through. i also calculated it and bare minimum costs for me with security deposit, subletting fee, additional rent, furnishing it from fb marketplace would be 4k. i came to terms with the fact that would not be financially feasible for me and the entire process would be incredibly stressful. i told him that i did not have the capacity to overexert myself and communicated that it was hurtful to me that i was bending over backwards for him to visit me, considering draining my savings and just eating shit and paying two rents, while he was not willing to pay for an airbnb for a weekend. i also encouraged him to reciprocate the amount of effort i had put in to this. he initially became very upset but later apologized and we made up and said that he would visit me for a weekend and get a hotel/airbnb. his family is very frugal and he shared that he has deep rooted issues about money and was also afraid of what his family would think initially only shared that it just wasnt practical, which i understand to an extent. he also clarified that i would not be renewing my lease for my current place for the upcoming year, which i confirmed. however, when i later asked him what our plan was for the fall he shared that since youre not subleasing anymore, i would stay with you in your apartment for like a month at a time until you met my parents in the fall. i asked him why i couldnt meet his parents in the summer and move in and the fall and he was pretty much just like idk, you can do that if you want to. then i voiced that if he were to stay with me without paying rent, then what i can afford independently would not necessary be comfortable or sustainable for two people. i shared the example that i can afford a run down apartment in a shitty neighborhood on my own for 1100 but if we split the costs then we could get a slightly nicer apartment for like 1400 and then have in-unit laundry, a functional kitchen for cooking, enough square footage for two people, etc. his response was that he didnt care where we live as long as he doesnt get shot or robbed. prior to meeting him i was okay with living with roommates as i am not super interested in spending 1/3 of my income on rent when i am paying off student loan debt, a car loan, etc. but to be able to have him visit me for a few weeks at a time, i was willing to spend a significant percentage of my income in order to be able to accommodate this temporarily. but now, it doesnt really make sense to me why i would be the one footing the bill so that we can spend time together when i make 3x as less. trying to get him to be straight up with me on difficult subjects is like pulling teeth, but i really do not understand this situation. it makes me feel like he is willfully withholding information or something because it does not make any sense. he frequently talks about wanting to marry me, spend the rest of his life with me, be with me or whatever, so i dont understand why he is switching up all of the sudden. i have his location and have seen him at work for eight hours a when he did work in-person, have seen him legitimately work in the job he says he has, and know that someone in his field does make as money as he does. but considering all of the aforementioned information, it literally seems like he is dead broke. is my boyfriend playing me? am i being unreasonable for wanting to not live in a shitty apartment in a shitty neighborhood, if we make roughly 200k combined, and now he would be splitting it with me? tldr: my boyfriend and i have been long-distance for over a year. he makes 150k, lives rent-free, and has barely helped plan for us to live together. i make 50k, work in-person, and have been doing all the emotional and logistical work, trying to figure out how we can see each other. i was willing to stretch my budget to make it happen, but it feels unfair that im the one paying the price when he makes 3x as much. now that he says hed stay with me for a month at a time without paying rent, im wondering why id settle for a shitty apartment alone when we could afford better together. he says he doesnt care where we live as long as we dont get shot.",

    "title": "My 25F boyfriend 23M of 5 months keeps crossing emotional boundaries with his ex - what to do?",
    "text": "Hi Reddit, Im emotionally exhausted and not sure what to do anymore. Ive been dating my boyfriend for a few months, and while hes loving and attentive in a lot of ways, our relationship has had a shaky foundation from the start and I keep discovering things that hurt. As context, weve been seeing each other for over 5 months now and this ex was my bfs most recent relationship lasting 2.5 years they used to live together. From the experiences hes shared, this ex sounds like an incredibly toxic, manipulative and controlling person and there was a high degree of codependency in this relationship. They were also in the same friend group, and the ex would try to spread false rumours about him and me his new gf to his friend group potentially with a goal to isolate his close friends from him. Wed discussed this at the very start of our relationship and he clearly stated his preference is NC given the messy breakup and all her vengeful actions post-breakup. From the beginning: He used to stalk his exs socials constantly - I only found this out a couple times by accident, each time he was dismissive saying he doesnt know why he did that but knows hes completely over her. He lied about having deleted a shared photo album with her off his phone willingly but later admitted he still looked through it while we were together, after I went through his camera roll one time 5 months into our relationship and finding out it was still there. He told me he was over her, but over two months into our relationship, he called her at midnight and again at 2 a.m. one night through Whatsapp. I only found out about this when looking through his camera roll and discovered a photo in the Whatsapp album of a plush toy they had together that he sent her on the same night he called her twice. Hed deleted the Whatsapp conversation so I couldnt see or know what was talked about. The reason he gave for sending this plush toy was because he felt it represented him which is more likely to invoke a response from her. He said the only reason he reached out was to try to get his stuff back. A few days later, he emailed her too to try get his stuff back, but he told me he deleted the email and couldnt show me what it said. That was after I had already communicated multiple times that his repeated attempts to keep the door open for contact made me uncomfortable, especially given their breakup was quite recent and not long before wed started dating. On Discord, he had conversations with his ex I wasnt made aware of. I had to dig to find things myself instead of him being upfront. He also lied to my face about this until I asked him to show proof - only then hed admitted to lying however still didnt show me any proof or conversation. The worst part is that I keep discovering these things myself not because he tells me, but because something feels off and I go looking. Each time Ive brought these things up, hes apologized, but often with vague justifications like I dont know why I did that or I wasnt missing her. Its like hes trying to rewrite the emotional intention behind it. Despite all of this, he treats me kindly day-to-day and tells me he loves me deeply. But I feel like Im constantly in emotional survival mode waiting for the next thing Ill have to forgive. Ive poured everything into this relationship, but the trust feels eroded. So my questions are: Are these red flags I shouldnt keep excusing? Is it possible hes emotionally not over his ex, even if he says he is? How do you know when its time to walk away from someone who loves you and you love dearly, but keeps breaking my trust and boundaries Ive set with them like this? I just want to feel safe and secure with the person Im with not like I have to constantly uncover whats going on behind the scenes. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice!",

Distractions sleep are the only things that keep my mind off of things like lost connections with close friends due to me isolating, no clear image of a path on where to take my future, family issues come up more than just how things used to be when I was younger than 18, sudden mental health issues that came out of nowhere that are hard to explain please dont refer me to see a therapist nor a psychiatrist. many more but dont want to make this too long. The only positive thing about me isolating getting off most of the internet is getting sober. , , .Other than that everyday that passes by I get farther away from who I used to be. Feels like during the day I overthink everything to the point I dont get anything productive done, then night falls Im visioning everything I want to do until eventually I get overwhelmed thinking about what Im not doing as well as whats missing from my life. How do I get out of this negative cycle attempt to get back somewhat how I used to be?",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years, but weve been on and off because at one point we were in different countries and even though we tried long distance two times, she ended it both times. In these off periods, she told me she dated two of my friends, which really hurt me. One of them was someone we had talked about when we were together, and how I knew about his intentions with her. Im no saint either. I went out with girls that would hit me up when I was with her after we broke up, which she felt uncomfortable about. We were really young, and still are of course, so I guess I was willing to look past everything. But now, after all this time, everything is good and its going well, we beat long distance kinda. Anyways, the real problem is that she really looks up to her mother. Both of her parents have cheated on each other, but honestly her mom just sounds to me like an unserious woman. Not only has she cheated, but one their family friends is her ex and never told her husband. From I know, she would also party A LOT and would tell me GF stories about Ibiza and Mykonos all the time. This does slightly worry me. But I dont think I can say anything, I know it would really put her off. What would you do in my position?",

    "text": "My bf of two years has a habit of being contrarian, basically questioning or challenging any opinion/thought I have, objective or subjective. Its pretty annoying sometimes but Ive gotten used to it most of the time. The main issue is Ive noticed hell be contrarian even if I agree with him. Like hell have an opinion and Ill say I agree! And then suddenly hell start challenging his OWN opinion. It kinda makes me feel like Im crazy sometimes. Like cant he just agree and leave something alone for once? I feel like he never does. Ive brought it up to him that he does this and he gets defensive and asks for examples. When I cant produce a lot of them because I have a bad memory he just kinda seems to assume Im exaggerating. But Im really not. :/ Ive also brought it up in the moment when he contradicts himself by saying something like I just agreed with you, why do you suddenly think differently? But he never really has a response for that. Any ideas on how to bring this up to him in another way? We dont argue as a result of these moments I just constantly feel like im being talked down to or something. Idk",

I am a pretty funny guy but nothing makes her laugh like she does with her. I ran into some of her friends last night at the bar, I said oh why isnt my gf with you guys?
