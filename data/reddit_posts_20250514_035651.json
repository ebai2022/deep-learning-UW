    "text": "I just opened a Capitol One checking, I have worked for my company for 2.5 years and have them listed on my Capitol One credit card. I switched direct deposit over to Capitol One once my checking was opened and informed my employeer. Employeer gives me a physical check and said the next pay check will be direct deposit. I deposit the check into Capitol one checking via mobile check deposit and It says its accepted. A few hours later I get an email saying its suspicious and for reasons they cant disclose theyre going to hold my money for a few days. A few days goes by and I check my account and all my funds are locked and they say I have to call them. I call them and my employeer bounced the check. I say BS I have worked with them for years this is a you issue and they say no it is not. I had to have them call my employeer so my employeer could verify my check was legit. After that Capitol one still says my check was bounced and my work need to release it. I call back and they now say I need to find a Capital One ATM to deposit the check. I go find one and deposit the check. A few hours later I get an email saying the check is suspicious and theyre going to hold my money for a few days. Remember they called and directly spoke to my employerr and verified the check was legit. So now in two days if I wake up and see all of my funds are on hold and they say my employeer bounced my check I am going to cancel every account i have with them. This is just a warning for anyone thinking of signing up for a Captiol one checking, as of right now this has been an absolute horrible experience and they just blame my employeer who I have worked with and had plenty of checks larger than my check Im depositing now scanned in on other banks apps without issues. Hopefully I remember to update this in a few days when my check hopefully goes through.",

    "text": "I will preface by saying that I have a beautiful relationship with my partner, and this is my only point of contention. We have shared values for most important things such as kids, religion, politics, finances, future goals, even most of our hobbies align. I am becoming increasingly frustrated and concerned with the fact that he does not exercise, almost at all, particularly over the last 6 months. Whilst he has gone through phases of exercising consistently, and during those times really enjoyed the benefits, for the last 6 months his work has been busier and he does not even try to make the time, or wake up 15 minutes earlier to go to the gym that is literally all that is required. I feel a lot of frustration and resentment when he chooses to spend his weekends playing video games or watching tv. He is naturally sedentary and totally content with it. I really worry about what this might mean for his health down the line - his job is only going to get more stressful and he is already struggling to put in place healthy habits to improve his life, health and manage stress. I have a similar busy job but I make time in my day to exercise because of the physical and mental benefits, I also really enjoy social sports but he generally has just watched and doesnt want to join. He is willing to come on walks and hikes with me, but only on the weekends and unfortunately we cant do that every weekend. I am not going to break up with him over this as that is a shallow reason to ruin an otherwise wonderful relationship. I am just not sure if I should bring this up with him, or how I can at least nudge him in the direction of being more active.",

    "text": "Ok as per the title my boyfriend and I have different political views. Id say im more liberal and hes more conservative. Before we had even started dating I had told him that I dont care much about politics and that it wouldnt change my mind about anything. However I was unaware of how in just a matter of a few months I was going to be incredibly invested in it. Before we started dating I wanted to make sure we had similar morals, and while some things we had slightly different opinions on we agreed on most-- ones that were deal breakers. I thought that was all that mattered but when he voted for Trump and he won, I felt hurt and upset. I suprised myself at how upset I had gotten because I didnt think I would be the type to care, but I was doing more research and actually looking into politics for once. I didnt know what to do especially since most of the morals we had agreed on were liberal if you will. My boyfriend treats me so incredibly well. Hes the sweetest kindest person. He drop anything for me and I love him. Ive been trying to justify his decision by saying hes uneducated about politics he is I promise. He also has had a rough relationship with his father and wants to do anything to please him nowadays, and his father is the biggest Trump supporter youll meet. His father believes liberals arent real men which is stupid but his son listens to his father. We dont fight much but most of the time if we do its about politics. Its gotten to the point where he said hell be more in the middle for me because he loves me. To be honest I think based off the conversations weve had he is a moderate which is okay. And his father isnt much of a stand up guy and his need to please him is the reason why he votes the way he does. Im just afraid that in another 4 years he votes for someone that again that does not align with my morals that I will have just wasted my time. Again he is the sweetest boy you can imagine its this one thing in the back of my mind that just wont let me feel at peace.",

    "text": "I 33f have been with my boyfriend 33m for 11 months now. We knew each other from when we were teenagers and reconnected after living in different cities for years. Our relationship is great and I think hes a wonderful person. He knows my love language is words of affirmation so we both keep in touch a lot and say sweet things to each other often. When I met him, hed been just over a year out of his marriage, a mutual decision on their part, a relationship of maybe 12 years. He told me it was over for a while before they split and there are no romantic feelings there anymore at all. Neither of us were looking for someone at the time, but we just felt so strongly for each other so we threw caution to the wind and got together. Hes still in the divorce and financial split process and Im wondering if this could be why. I do feel Ive sort of nudged the relationship forward more than him, like finding out where we stand/meeting his family etc. its moved very slow and for the most part, I get it and accept it, and as someone who has been to therapy I feel like Ive helped him open up and understand his self better. Ive been feeling sad about not hearing those words, as he knows how important words of affirmation are to me, but at this stage I dont want to say them first because as I said, I felt like Ive moved us forward much more than him. Were vocal with sweet words, Ive met his friends and family and hes met mine, but Im really not sure what to do? I dont want to outright ask him why hes not saying it as I truly think he feels it but Ive sent him enough hinty memes, even ones saying the word love in it so Im running out of ideas. I know some people will say as long as he acts like it, its not a problem, but for me its super important to hear it - in previous relationships, Ive heard it after max 3 months.. So what now?! Any help and advice is appreciated TLDR: still waiting on my boyfriend to say I love you after 11 months",

    "text": "Three days ago, I was at a bar with two friends. There were two guys sitting at the table next to us. One of my friends started talking to one of them, and I started talking to the other one. We had a great conversation. We followed each other on Instagram and Spotify, and we had an unexpected connection. Then my friend and the guy she was talking to started kissing. So I turned to the guy I was with and half-jokingly asked, So when are we going to kiss? He said, Whenever you want, and I told him I wanted to kiss right now. So we did. It was my first kiss. He knew that because I told him. But he kissed me anyway, and honestly, I havent stopped thinking about it since. I went home after that night, and even though we only spent a short time together, I kept replaying it in my head. I wasnt sure if he felt the same way, but I knew I felt something. Yesterday, I noticed that he was listening to one of my Spotify playlists. And somehow, that gave me the courage to text him. Today, after three days of overthinking, I finally got the courage to message him on Instagram. I just said, Whats up? But three hours passed and he didnt respond. I dont know if Im getting ghosted or just overly anxious but its really confusing me.",

    "text": "TW: Mentions of abusive relationship My partner M/24 was recently diagnosed with NPD - hes this complex mix of echoist and narcissist. Clinically, he ranks 1 on the echoist side and 9 on the narcissistic side. Our relationship has been challenging, particularly given a history of abusive behaviours. When a friend reached out to me from his work about his weird interactions with a coworker, something just clicked. The whole situation is messy and I had a gut feeling long before. This woman was literally complimenting me, calling me pretty, while simultaneously flirting with my boyfriend. When wed technically broken up, they decided quickly jump into being fuck buddies. I didnt care about the fuck buddy situation post-breakup. But heres the thing: affairs dont just happen overnight. Theyre like slow-burning failures - you think everythings fine, and then suddenly, youre falling. I confronted her, laid out the two life-threatening abusive incidents hed caused me, and asked about their relationship. Her response? Complete denial about ever flirting with my partner. Plot twist: I called her out later. She claimed to be a girls girl right after lying to my face. Heres my core perspective: The affair partner isnt innocent when they knowingly mess with a coupled relationship. Affairs take multiple conscious decisions to destroy someones life, all for some escape or a sick ego boost. This relationship, as broken as it was, was my HOME. And someone just invited themselves in, knowing I was unaware. Do I blame my partner more than anyone? Absolutely. But Im not here to let anyone pretend the other woman is some innocent bystander. Thank you for letting me vent guys. I needed that. For extra information- He didnt end up doing anything sexual in RL, he came back apologising wanting me back. I didnt talk to him back for a month straight until he enrolled himself into rehab and multiple counselling/ therapy centers. I have a good support system now and I have a safety plan in check. Please do not underestimate narcissistic relationships and their attachment to their victims, sometimes it gets real scary",

    "text": "He never met anyone quite like my boyfriend. Hes been through a lot in life, with some family troubles growing up, his dad not being in the picture a not so nice step dad. Hes been to therapy for this. Hes also ex military, so is a very realistic typical masculine man. Hes done so well for himself in life is now working in a high paying corporate job, thats very busy. Ive never had a guy invest into me so much. Hes bought he diamond earring, paid for flights to holidays, a Rolex.. a new tv for my new place.. he really spends more money on me, than he spends on things for himself. Apart from his car.. haha He put my need first in the bedroom definitely knows what hes doing. hes overall shown himself to be really honorable, being there for his friends in times when they were in need, telling them what they need to hear, even if its not what they wanted to hear. Ive I ever have any issues, with work, family or personal things, hes there to listen give advice. He never makes me feel like an inconvenience. Ive met his friends, hes met mine, he speaks about me to his family.. all green flags there. All sounds amazing.. right? So my but is hes not in touch with his emotions is very stoic, so you can never really tell what hes thinking or feeling on his face/body language. Hes also not good with words of affirmation. He never says he loves me first, but will say I love you too He will rarely compliment me. Only if I get really dressed up for a dinner, Ill get a you look nice Ill never get any I miss you, youre so cute, your ___ looks great today nothing. Hes got chronic back pain is in need of a surgery this year for it. So our sex life is lacking lately too because hes in pain. Or he says hes in pain.. despite us not having sex that often, hell still go do physical activities like the gym or sky diving. When we do have sex also, it feel good, but because hes stoic.. it can be hard for me to feel connected to him. I dont feel that passion. It feels amazing, but its a bit disconnected. Lacking that emotion. It plays on my mind sometimes that maybe hes not fully into me. Thats why he doesnt think to compliment me. Even though he says he THINKS compliments all the time but has struggles saying it out loud, and that this is something he tried to work on in therapy Or isnt as keep or connected during sex.. or doesnt think to say I love you to me, out of the blue.. But then.. why keep me? Hes young successful good looking. Hes spending money, time effort on me. Its quite tricky. Ive talked to him many times about the lack of I love yous.. lack of compliments.. and lack of sex at the minute he explains gives his reasons as to why those things dont happen.. says hell try to work on it.. and nothing changes. TLDR MY boyfriend seems perfect and my dream guy in so many aspects, but in others, it can make me wonder if hes even that into me?",
