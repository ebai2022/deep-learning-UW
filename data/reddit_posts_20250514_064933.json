    "text": "My now ex boyfriend lets call him T just told me he has been smoking weed every week and doing hard drugs cocaine in particular and is unable to quit. Drugs and substances are a huge dealbreaker for me and I told him this on our very first date. He lied and said he didnt do any substances. He has a friend who does though, and I asked him multiple times if he does them as well and he always said no. Yesterday we bumped into his friend and his friend gave him this container of white powder so I got suspicious. T said it wasnt anything weird but I got upset because I didnt trust his friend lmao guess my gut instinct was right. Today T told me that he actually did do drugs and weed with his friend on a regular basis and that he was afraid to tell me because he liked me on our first few dates. I told him if he wants to date me, he needs to quit and he said he doesnt want to and cant quit So yeah we broke up because he didnt even want to try to stop it and thats his choice. I know my boundaries and I know I cant date someone who smokes or uses any substances. But Im still heartbroken because he lied to my face for almost a year and didnt even feel bad until he saw my reaction. I truly liked him a lot, and it kills me to find out what he has been doing behind my back. I just dont get why he wouldnt tell me on the first date when we were talking about deal breakers wouldnt it have been better to cut things off from day 1? Regardless I guess now I know hes a liar and lowkey manipulated me for a year by pretending to be someone he wasnt. But it still hurts. I just dont know how to trust anyone after this. Honestly I would just like some reassuring words and any kind of advice to move on. I truly liked him so much and it honestly kills me to find out that hes been lying to me about such a big dealbreaker.",

    "text": "Location: Nebraska. My husband went out of town for what I thought was a golfing trip with his business clients. Turns out he was actually transporting a bunch of marijuanna across state lines. He got pulled over, arrested and is now facing a charge with a maximum sentence of 20 years and no minimum so we are hoping he gets probation. Possession with intent to deliver and manufacture. His court date is approaching and my anxiety is increasing. What are the chances he will do prison time? Im just looking for honest opinions. He does have a lawyer but the lawyer can only do so much. Lawyer said it ultimately will depend on the judge he gets at his sentencing. I intend to update this post after his sentencing hearing.",

There are two houses on the lot which my uncle is the actual owner of. He lives in one I rent the other20 years. I will be paying a large outstanding property tax bill making this all happen. By in the process of having this swap done, I mean we are still shopping for a real estate lawyer for other issues with the property. Besides the name swap, we are looking to combine a 2nd connecting empty lot which is also owned by my uncle into one lot. Both lots have been paid off for a long time and have no mortgage. There is also an issue where the property tax is stating there are 3 house on this lot instead of 2. There used to be 3 but it was torn down a long time ago. So, we are in the process of looking for a real estate lawyer that deals with these sorts of things. Its seems most just do closings estate planning. Is this the correct lawyer to be looking for? Is there any implications to my name being put on the deed, positive or negative? The other siblings that are on this deed have not paid anything into the property or have paid taxes/bills on it. I am just curious if I would be hit with some tax bill going forward or the like for my name being on it. Location: NYC",

Mind you I had messaged them before and told them I was unsatisfied with it and I also told them this was the wrong product 15 refund comes into play. Anyways I requested a full refund through Ali express and went through that process which was about another week and the entire time theyre blowing up my inbox and emails essentially begging me not to return it. Return/Refund finally completed today, refund is on the way and I got a message from them on ali express where they threatened to sue me, and also this email: We have your recipiUnder the agreement, you have received a 15 refund compensation from our company, but in this case, you still choose to return the item.

Ive been living alone for the last year and a half, but the last month or three I cant get myself to clean my house properly or keep up with maintenance. I also dont have the drive to do little things in general. For example as easy as doing the dishes on time, bringing an item from point A to B in the house. Ive not been sleeping the best either. I find myself going to bed at late times and even if I go to bed at a proper time, I wake up tired. Ive not been eating well enough and Im taking worse acre of myself than before. Im not neglecting myself though. Lastly, everything I do feels unsatisfactory. Things that used to be fun, just arent anymore. Idk The thing is, Im aware of these things but I cant really get myself to do it. I have tried to set up agendas and to do lists, but they dont last long. Anyone got some advice for me, much appreciated!",

    "title": "PA Beekeeping Neighbor",
    "text": "Location: Pennsylvania Hi all, Im looking for some assistance interpreting local laws and ordinances in relation to bee keeping. In addition, I would also like to understand nusiance laws and how they might apply to my situation. I love bees, but my neighbors beekeeping hobby is interfering with my ability to peacefully enjoy my property. In addition, this hobby often involves my neighbor coming onto my property. I know this post is quite long, but I wanted to add as many details as possible. I live in a residential area of town in a house with an 8,500sq ft lot. My neighbors lot is similarly sized, and his house is roughly 25-30ft from mine. My neighbor is also a beekeeper, and has his bee boxes apologies if this isnt the correct terminology on the side of the house that borders mine. When he began his beekeeping hobby, relations were mostly cordial. I have nothing against honey bees, and for the most part, the bees stayed on his property. As his hives or maybe his hobby grew, I started to see more and more bees flying around my yard. My school aged daughter has severe anxiety and is terrified of being stung even though honeybees dont typically sting, so I politely asked my neighbor if they could be relocated to either the other side of his house or the backside of the property. However, the other side is in close proximity to another neighbor, and his dogs use the back yard - so while he was not willing to relocate them, he did install a 6ft flight barrier. The flight barrier helped, but only temporarily. As time went on, the bees flying around my yard got worse. My daughter was scared to go in the back yard, and friends and family that would visit felt uncomfortable being in my back yard / on my back porch. I attempted to talk to my neighbor about this multiple times, and although he was unwilling to take any further action, things were still fairly peaceful. However, after noticing that my dogs had been stung, things began to escalate. I would share my concerns with the neighbor, and he would resort to arguing and name calling. A friend suggested that I bring this to the borough council, as it was interfering with my ability to enjoy my property, so I did. At first, they agreed that this was an issue and said your family shouldnt have to deal with this. I cant remember the specific details, but they said that due to borough ordinances livestock law, the neighbor was in violation. However, I was contacted a week later and told that the decision was reversed, as bees are considered agriculture and do not violate borough laws and ordinances. I looked up the ordinances / regulations and the language is very ambiguous when it comes to bees. One document states that livestock and non domesticated animals cannot be kept or bred within city limits, and it lists animals such as poulty, chicken, duck, etc - but not bees. It also says that house hold pets / other domesticated animals are permitted but cannot run at large on another persons property. I believe this is what was citied when they made the initial decision that the neighbor was in violation. In the documentation on zoning, there is one mention of the word bee, which is in the glossary under the definition of agriculture. The term is defined as The production, keeping or maintenance, for sale, lease or personal use of plants and animals for human use and consumption, including but not limited to crops, grains and seeds dairy animals/products poultry and poultry products livestock bees and apiary products silvicultural, trees and forest products fruits and vegetables and horticultural, nursery and floral products. In another section in the zoning document, it states that Agriculture, animals and poultry. Unless otherwise controlled by municipal ordinance or regulation, operations involving the use of buildings and land for farming, gardening, nurseries, greenhouses, riding academies, livery or boarding stables, dog kennels, animal hospitals, stock raising, dairying and poultry shall be permitted in all districts subject to the following safeguards and regulations. The only relevant regulation listed in that section is Buildings in which animals or poultry are kept shall not hereafter be erected within 200 feet of any lot line with the exception of a veterinary establishment solely limited to facilities necessary to the temporary treatment of sick or otherwise ailing pets normally permitted within the house and yard and to include dogs, cats, canaries, parakeets and similar household pets such veterinary establishment may be erected as close as 50 feet to any lot line. Relations with the neighbor are now very tense. In addition, his bees will sometimes swam the trees and bushes on my property, requiring him to come onto my property to remove them. When I inform him of the swarm, it can take from minutes to hours for him to take care of the problem. I know honeybees arent supposed to sting, but my dogs have been stung and I can clearly see my neighbor being stung anytime a swarm is removed. At the start of a swarm which can last hours thousands upon thousands of bees fill the air, occupying every inch of my yard and making it impossible to do any work or peacefully enjoy the property. Up to this point, Ive done everything I can think of, and the problem only gets worse. Ive tried so many times to resolve this with the neighbor, but things have just gotten ugly. Ive tried going to the borough council, only to be told the violation was reversed. Bees are great, but not when they are constantly flying around my property. I just want my daughter, family, friends, and dogs to be able to use the yard without the constant fear of getting stung, and for my neighbor to stay off my property. At one point my backyard was an enjoyable place for outdoor parties and warm weather visits - and it makes me said that no one will come over anymore due to the bees. I have a few questions: 1. Is there anything I misunderstood, or anything additional I should check for regarding local ordinances? 2. Is there a case here under the nuisance law? 3. As a last resort, would there be any legal ramifications if I trespass my neighbor from my property - and the next time a swarm is on my bush or tree, have a local beekeeper come and relocate the swarm instead of contacting my neighbor? I really appreciate any help and advice.",

    "title": "Why am I not enough for someone to love?",
    "text": "Rejected again-losing hope I 37F have been struggling trying to figure out what I want went it comes to my love life due to all of the rejections Ive received. Im losing faith that I will never find love I apologize for how long this is but Im tired of being rejected and I need advice on what it is Im doing wrong I am extremely shy and guarded and insecure so its a struggle for me but People say put yourself out there so I try to be myself and be honest but none of my love interests last more than a month and Im starting to wonder if theres something wrong with me? Here are some issues that I face when being open and honest Experience- Ive had a lot of trauma in my life. I wasnt allowed to date until I was 16yrs old and I respected my mother enough to listen to that rule. She ended up passing when I was 16 so I didnt end up dating. The loss of her was to much to focus on men or boys. I never got to experience high school love. By the time I was ready to date which was around 18 I put myself out there but not as much. I would go on small dates here and there but nothing long term until I met this guy via MySpace and allowed myself to get catfished for almost 3yrs. Never do that its not worth your time. This made my sexual experience physically non existent but we would sext so I was open to exploring my sexuality. I was finally able to wake up from the fantasy of him and had a few flings but I was shy when it came to sex because I was 22 with no sexual experience. I was sexually physical with two men but it never went further than 3rd base and I stayed a virgin until I was 24 because I was waiting for someone special. I felt worthy that no man touched me for that long, I was proud and never ashamed but I noticed that the men I told always had an issue with it so it took longer for me to find the right partner but I knew my worth and was not going to settle. Heres where it all went down hill I never lost my virginity it was taken against my will by a coworker I thought I trusted and confided in. He date raped me one night I was celebrating my promotion. To say that i didnt trust being near men after that is an understatement. It destroyed my self worth I stopped dating for a year. I decided to stay celibate again until I found the right person but I was lonely so I changed my mind and lost my revirginity to a friend I didnt enjoy the experience at all so it was a one night stand with a friend. We never had sex again. I became celibate again and met someone who made me feel so much attraction like I couldnt resist him. No one ever made me feel that way before and I was so sexually attracted to him but he sensed I was inexperienced and I felt like he was not interested in me enough long term so I ended things when he couldnt answer what he wanted between us after a month of dating. We never had sex I wanted to be sure. I was 26 by that time. I was so lonely but I still didnt give up putting myself out there. The trauma of the rape took a toll on me by this time. I started being wreckless and drinking and I was lonely. I wont get into much detail but I had 3 sexual experiences with strangers and only once. Im mortified to say this but Ive literally only had sex 4 times and was raped once. I have no other physical sexual experiences. Most of the time I just watch porn or sext online. Im now celibate another 5yrs. Ive tried not telling men because Im not an open book and Ive also tried telling them. Ive tried casual sex its not for me obviously. Ive tried the opposite sex Im not sexually attracted to them. Ive tried being honest and said I want long term. No one I speak with is looking for that or they gaslight me into thinking they want the same and go radio silent after really getting to know me. No good male role models- I was molested as a child and my father is a dead beat. Ive dated all different types of men but I dont know what a real man looks like. All of the male role models in my life arent great examples to base a romantics connection off of. I dont really have many male friend for traumatic reasons. I struggle with my self worth and value. I dont feel worthy of love. I feel extremely tainted and I dont value myself sometimes. Im getting better now but as soon as I put myself out there again I keep getting the same result. How I carry myself I feel like I give off this aura of damaged goods and sexual deviant and those are the men that gravitate toward me. Id like to believe I am very attractive so Im constantly over sexualized which makes me feel disgusted. Lastly I dont know what I want- I just know what I dont. I wrote down all the qualities and things I want in someone but since Im losing faith that will never happen for me. Im slowly contemplating whether I should just settle. I think sometime I should just meet someone and just have sex with no emotions or attachment but I know deep down this isnt what I want. I know I want a deep connection and friendship that leads to love I am a sexual person but I want to have sex with the right person and idk what to do anymore I need help I am currently in therapy- I was diagnosed with Severe PTSD from my trauma- I am not sure if this also contributes to why I always get rejected",

Same humor, same interests, just one of those friendships where you always feel understood without needing to explain yourself. But ever since he got into this new relationship, things have slowly shifted. I dont blame him for being happy or prioritizing his partner, thats normal. But its like everything about him changed. The way he talks, what he cares about, even the energy between us feelsoff? We still chat regularlybut 50 less, send memes, act like everythings normal but deep down I feel like the connection is already gone. Like were going through the motions. And the stupid part is, I dont even think he notices or feels the same way. Its just me silently realizing that were not us anymore. Ive been holding onto this false hope that its just a phase and things will go back to how they were, but Im slowly starting to accept that Im basically talking to a memory at this point. I dont know how to let go without making it a big dramatic thing. I dont want to start a fight or guilt trip him. I just want to stop waiting for a version of him that doesnt exist anymore. Do you have any advice or have you been in similar situations?",

    "text": "So my M29 girlfriend F25 lets call her Sara, really hates my parents, weve been together a year. my parents M60s F60s are okay but can be a bit draining and prudish, I get it, theyre also very negative and talk about the same things all the time. I only see them maybe twice a year because they live in another country. Long story short, she hates them, for reasons which are fair, when I was a child and I was being sexually abused by a trusted member of the family, I told them about it when it came to an end when I was 14, they both werent helpful at all, my mum just worried what other people might think and my dad literally fell asleep on the sofa whilst I was telling him, and when I woke up him upset he just shrugged his shoulders and said what do you want me to do about it then like it was nothing. Years later, as an adult, I reminded them, they pretended like they didnt remember and then they decided to invite my abuser over for Christmas Dinner like it was nothing, they had lost regular contact with him but then invited him over, I was so uncomfortable the guy is still a creep and after he left they made jokes about his creepiness and directly asked me why do you hate him? you werent very sociable with him, you need to feel sorry for him so yeah, I came forwards to the entire family, outed my abuser, it tore everyone up and for an entire year I had to be therapist for everyone in the family helping them digest the news. I respected my parents wishes to keep it secret that they ever knew, and theyve been compensating ever since, coming all the way here to help with DIY even though I dont need much help but then they had the audacity recently to ask me for a large sum of money paid back to them from years ago they gave me a bit to help my by my home but told me at the time not to worry about repaying it and this shocked me considering everything theyve put me through, everything Ive done for them and theyre also very wealthy and dont have to work etc im not giving them that money back Back to Sara, shes been with me since after these events, shes amazing, and I love her, but every time my parents come to visit which isnt often she gets really stressed and finds it draining to even look at them doesnt want to see them etc, I told her she doesnt have to. But then she just gets snappy even when I offer her the freedom not to be involved etc, which doesnt help me. Also whenever we have an unrelated argument or disagreement and I defend myself she will say you sound just like your parents which Ive told her numerous times is extremely hurtful. So although she has valid reasons to not like them, it hurts she takes that out on me. I just dont know how to handle this?",

I went from zero issues fully controlled to having to take steroids and antibiotics for a week which didnt help at all. Then my doctor added stronger medications to my daily routine to try to help and filled out ADA accommodations stating that I need to work remote due to my asthma being uncontrolled. I got the ADA decision recently and was told that my request was denied. They said they are willing to have a conversation about alternatives but the alternatives are additional breaks, using vacation time, and asking coworkers to stay away from me. None of that will help with the fact that mold remediation was never done after the building flooded, there is a hole in the roof, and there are plants growing through the foundation of the building allowing outdoor pollution into the building.

Let me tell you this, its been the best decision that Ive ever made when it comes to social life. First few weeks Ive had pure anxiety. My heart would literally pound out of my chest for saying morning to the postman. But then something just clicked like people actually responded positively and it felt so good. The craziest thing and the main reason I even made this post is that one of the random hellos to someone at the park turned into a friendship. We became very good friends and went out a lot and then he made a referral for me on his workplace. Now Im employed. Its fucking crazy. Let me tell u a few things: when u start its gonna be very hard. Youre gonna feel anxiety, youre gonna want to quit, youre gonna wanna go home in your bed and all that stuff. But please, just keep going for a week. 1 thing that helped ma a lot and can also help you a lot is 1 simple word: Sonder. Google it :. Have a great week yall!",

    "text": "Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons... My girlfriend got diagnosed just now with Myeloma, which is an incurable type of bone marrow cancer. Median life expectancy is 4 years. We have been together for almost a year now, of which it has been long distance since this January, but Im going to visit her soon the trip was already planned before she announced it to me. Its not a lot, but it has been a very healthy and happy relationship on both sides. Looking back at it, it should have been quite clear as she has really suffered with fatigue, back-pain especially the spine and more recently a fracture there. I really dont know what to do. I love her, shes honestly one of the sweetest and kindest persons that Ive ever met. She also really loves me. Idk what to do. I wanna stay together with her because I love her, but at the same time I know that I will not be able to grow old with her... Im scared that I will not be able to support her as I should. We also lived on the opposite side of the world right now because of visa problems on her side even though shes from the US. She should come back in a few months to study but I have no idea whats going to happen, it may be that she will have to go back again if she doesnt find a job as it already happened. The idea to break-up to save ourselves a lot of pain has even surfaced in my mind as an intrusive thought... I love her, and if conditions were normal, I would want to spent the rest of my life with her. Just yesterday she was telling me about her grandma and how they are so similar, and how most likely shes gonna be like her when shes going to be older, and to realize that that will never happen breaks my heart... Honestly idk what to say, any advice is appreciated. Im crying a lot rn. What would you do in this situation?",

Ive been unemployed on and off for a year and a half and Im choosing to jump ship from the industry instead of waiting for my useless degree to finally show for something. I decided to go into healthcare and found radiologic technology and will be starting my program next June. However, for the 2 year program its going to cost around 25k and I will only be able to work on the weekends if at all. I am going to do whatever I can to save between now and June, but since I cant get financial aid and dont qualify for most grants/scholarships Im thinking of ways I can pay any remaining balances for school. I have 3 credit cards, and one has a 4k balance on it but Im thinking of signing up for my schools payment plan and just maxxing them out then filing bankruptcy after I graduate. Is this a good plan? Can educational expenses in this sense be included?",

    "text": "TW: Mentions of CA My boyfriend 21M and I 19F have been together for 3 years. Hes my first serious relationship, and lately Ive been struggling to figure out whats normal in a relationship and what might not be. Theres been a pattern of behavior thats made me increasingly uncomfortable, and I just dont know if Im overthinking or if I should be more concerned. Here are some of the thing that stand out the most 6 months into dating, he kept coming to visit me at work, even after my manager threaten to fire me. He came to my senior prom but refused to dance or even leave the table, making the night miserable for me. He promised to go to therapy to work on his anxiety and emotional dependency, but that never happened. He made me miss most of my graduation party because he needed comfort and attention. Were very politically different we voted for different people in 2024. He frequently prioritizes his friends over me, especially one friend in particular. Ive had to ask him not to answer calls from them during serious conversations between us. I found out he was talking badly about spending time with me and my family. He lied about being with friends when he was actually at a bar, and lied to my face even after I gave him multiple chances to come clean. He says we cant hang out because hes with the boys. but then I see that those boys brought their girlfriends. When good things happen for me getting an apartment, car, or job, he doesnt seem happy for me, he tries to supportive but fails Most recently: He told me we were going out with friends, so I got ready and was about to leave when he changed the plan, saying there was no room for me on the boat. He promised wed hang out later, go to an arcade and dinner. But when I met him at 7:30 like we agreed, he was 30 minutes late and then told me we were just hanging at some guys house i barely know. I drove 30 minutes home after that without hanging out However he can be incredibly sweet and caring He once DoorDashed me supplies when I was super hungover. He supports me emotionally and helps me work through some really painful childhood trauma both my parents were verbally abusive, and my mom was physically abusive toward my sister. Hes working on changing a behavior I brought up recently. Hes sweet and kind to me in person. He never makes me feel stupid when I dont know something. Hes very open with his feelings and vulnerable with me. He worries about me, is protective, and pays for things since he knows Im tight on money. SoIm really torn. There are genuinely great moments, and I do really love him, but the inconsistency, the lies, and the way I often feel second or like an afterthought is starting to really bother me :/ Is this normal. Is this just growing pains, or are these signs or serious stuff i should worry about? Any help is welcome. I just feel lost.",

    "text": "Location: Florida So I understand that by default in ch 7 and ch 13 student loans are not dischargable and its very difficult to meet the legal standard to prove an undue hardship. Whenever I was in grad school I made some poor financial decisions, which is ironically why people end up choosing bankruptcy in the first place. As a result I find myself in a situation with these private loans where I am for all intents and purposes insolvent. As it stands right now I cannot pay it. I was operating under the belief that private student loans were similar to other forms of unsecured debt like personal loans and credit cards because the process for applying is very similar. You go to the website of a bank or private lender, they do a credit check and tell you youre approved and they ask how much you need. Well I stupidly took out the maximum up to the cost of attendance every year I used them. I used the refund they gave me for non educational expenses. Additionally I believe the cost of attendance my loans were certified for assumed I was a full time student but I attended as a part time student. I thought either the school or lender would verify this but I dont think they did. Given my dire financial situation, i dont see any other choice but bankruptcy. Would I possibly have a case that these loans werent a qualified educational loan? I am trying to weigh my options at this point.",

I managed to trade up to 80k in the last 14 months with a 5x leverage. Today I traded for about an hour and made 2.228,56 just in profit. Now Im wondering if when I start with a real account with 300 but with real money, do you guys think I can actually make the same amount? I now have more free time because I finished school but university starts next year so I would have enough time to fully focus on trading. I would trade 5 days a week for 2-3 hours and see how much I can make, but I just wanna know your opinion on that and if you think that its possible/realistic? My calculations from today are this: Initial Capital - 80,062.64 Capital at Current Time - 82,291.20 The time between was about a hour and 10 mins. Difference - 2,228.56 2,228.56 x 5 days 11,142.80 11,142.80 x 4 weeks 44,571.20 If I dont understood something, please correct me. Im here trying to learn. Thanks",
