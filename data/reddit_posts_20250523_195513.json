    "text": "such a bizarre problem I have no idea how to deal with. A few months ago she had our second baby and as is expected she gained some weight, I didnt really think much of it, understanding the tolls pregnancy can take on the human body and just kind of assumed she would get back into the gym and gradually shed the extra weight over time, as weve both always been fit people and have gone to the gym together: Throughout our relationship she was always fit, had a great figure etc. This second pregnancy she had gained quite a bit of extra weight which I thought might be a little out of the ordinary, I wasnt going to say anything of course but I noticed a pattern of behaviour from her, such as posting in a lot of fat positive subs, sharing pictures that really accentuate the parts of her where she has gained extra weight. I mentioned to her that Im not really into the whole fat positive thing personally, just felt it had to be said honestly because there seemed to be a pattern of being okay with being bigger/chubby. She then explained to me that she loves being bigger and actually wants to gain more weight. At this point, I had to explain to her that Im not into that, our sex life would take a significant hit it already has tbh and Id prefer if she remained fit and hourglass shaped like she always had been. Perhaps my choice of words were poor, because she is now saying that I must not find her attractive anymore because of the extra baby weight. I explained to her that I dont mind the extra baby weight because I get that it comes with having a baby, but to be honest I just assumed that she would shed it overtime. My honest truth is I dont want it to stay forever, Id prefer if she wanted to get back into being fit with me. I know people must think shes fucking with me, but this girl honest to god wants to be chubby. She has sent me pictures of clearly overweight women with huge BBLs and boob jobs and says thats what she wants to look like. This is truly baffling to me as it looks ridiculous and horrible and shes always been so sexy. I dont care if she has some extra baby weight for a while but tbh she used to weigh around 120-130 before this baby and now is around 180-190, and shes telling me she wants to stay this way and gain more??? Am I a dick for not wanting this? She has been sulking and acting cold towards me for the past 3 days because I was honest with her and told her I dont feel good about it. I have explained to her that I do find her attractive but you cant expect me to just accept you being overweight and not have it affect my attraction levels whatsoever. Our sex life has been effected and she keeps saying how upset she is because we arent as physically affectionate anymore, but I feel I cannot force myself to be in to something that Im just not. Breaking up is not an option. This problem honestly just came out of nowhere and I am sad and confused.",

The work conditions actually suck, point blank. Its very male dominated, lots of unprofessional behavior, this week an employee got into a fight flipped off another employee, stupid shit like that. Sales agents are always making mistakes in their sales, but the owner does nothing and I have brought it to his attention. The longer Ive worked here, the less I like the position, the owner of this company sucks, he doesnt communicate tasks in a timely manner, forgets things that are essential, fails to work cooperatively to ensure that we are getting things done, and forgets important deadlines. As the job has progressed I am taking on additional workloads that were not expected discussed or planned, he expects me to complete all of his personal appointments, tasks, and planning, alongside taxes, payroll, employee files, licensing, bonuses, advertising, hiring, and more. I am not being paid enough, even after we decided upon a salary. Payroll is calculated by hand, he wants it done no other way. He texts me upset as hell today that there were a couple mistakes in the payroll sheet, and at this point, I dont know what to do. I am perfectly capable of handing this job but not when I dont have the tools to help me. Does anyone have some serious advice on this?",

    "title": "my 20F boyfriend 22M claims he is done with me and is acting stone cold, how do i earn him back?",
    "text": "hi, i know that my caption makes me look like i have no respect but i really do love my boyfriend and i cant see myself without him. im not looking to be told youll get over it or that you just have to accept it and move on because i know that eventually thats a possibility but i at least want to try to get him to at least have a conversation with me. a few days ago him and i were talking and we were asking each other hypothetical questions, i basically asked him if he would have a side girlfriend if i let him. he was aware that this was a hypothetical question and that it was just a question for fun. at first he said no and that hed rather spend the time playing video games but we talked more about it and he ended up saying that he liked it and was genuinely discussing ways on how we would make it work if we ever tried it which obviously im not open to. i ended up getting upset and we were arguing, it was pretty late at night and he has always had a problem where he will get mad or fed up in the middle of arguments and just go to sleep this was over text message btw. im the complete opposite and i cannot physically go to sleep until the problem is solved so i sat up all night thinking about what happened. i ended up writing some questions i had for him down in my notes app so that when he woke up i could text him and get closure and reassurance on the situation. he woke up that morning for work and i was sending him my questions and we were talking about it but we both had a little bit of a sour attitude because of the argument. i was telling him how i felt and how i thought he was disgusting for what he said which seemed to really bother him so he was getting increasingly mad and i was getting mad at him because i felt like i had the right to call him disgusting after what he said. the argument ended up escalating and i told him that i hope one day he finds the woman of his dreams and she tells him that she wants to fuck other guys. after that he just said have a nice day and blocked me on everything. his sister and i are somewhat mutual so i texted her on instagram and told her to tell him to unblock me so that i could fix it. he unblocked me but he was as cold as ice, he told me that i could say what i had to say but that he was done with me and didnt ever want to talk to me again. i begged him to just have a conversation with me about it so that we could fix it and he told me you decided that insulting me was worth more than whatever chance we still had last night which i dont blame him for at all and hes completely right about that. i gave him a genuine apology from my heart and i meant everything i said to him, i was truly sorry that i had hurt him and said those things. i know that sorry doesnt fix anything but i just cant understand how he went from being in love with me to completely hating my guts over what i said. after a while he quit responding and i wasnt blowing his phone completely up but i was sending him a few paragraphs trying to genuinely apologize and make things right with him. there was absolutely nothing, not a peep from him. after i while i just asked him are we going to talk after you get home from work at least? and i ended up calling him. he said no, i already told you im done talking to you and at that point i gave up on begging him and decided that maybe if he took some space and blew off some steam at work that hed text me and wed be okay. i had been up all night that night so i sent him a text telling him to text me when he feels better and i got some rest. after about 2 hours of sleep i woke up from an absolutely horrible nightmare and automatically all i wanted to do was text him. i texted him and told him i had a nightmare and that i knew he was mad at me but that i really needed him right now. he responded and said something like i dont know why you thought shit was gonna be sweet after what you said last night or something along those lines and he stopped responding again. that right there completely shattered my heart and sent me into panic mode because the man i know wouldve always been there for me during situations like that even if he was mad at me. at that point i knew it was over but for some reason i still had hope in my heart that hed eventually forgive me and give me a chance to talk to him about it. another day went by and i spent all day writing him a hand written letter than i planned on sending him through the mail to make amends because i knew he didnt want to talk to me. by the time i cooked up a letter that felt good enough it was night time and i had really started missing him. i dont know what it is about night time but it always makes me feel so much worse, it makes me overthink so much about situations like this. i told myself that i wouldnt text him and that i would leave him be but i ended up sending him multiple long paragraphs about how i felt. i got very heart felt and went into detail about how much i missed him, i told him that he used to be the only person who truly comforted me and how weird it was that he was suddenly not here anymore. before i went to bed i had hope in my heart that maybe my messages would reach something in him and id wake up to messages from him asking to fix things but when i woke up the next day there was absolutely nothing. i just ended up texting him and telling him that i was ready for him to block me because i couldnt resist texting him and it hurt too much seeing that he didnt respond. i asked him if it was okay for me to ask him a few questions before he blocked me so that i could get proper closure since i was hurt and a little bit confused. he responded and said ill answer them when im at home and settled down, im not doing this at work and it feels like youre purposely texting me on my lunch break which for the record was not my intention at all, i didnt even check the time. i responded to him and apologized a lot, i asked him to please not be mad at me for it because it was an accident and didnt want to ruin his day. for the first time since we argued he showed me kindness, he told me that it was fine and to have a good day with his pet name he uses for me. this was a few hours ago and he gets off in 2 hours, i changed my mind and i really dont want him to block me or leave but i feel like he has already made his decision. my boyfriend has always been a hard working dedicated man and i know that if i dont attempt to change his mind that he really will block me and do what he has to do to move on. i know what i did was immature and it was very wrong, i should have never even asked him that hypothetical question or said what i said towards the end. i REALLY love him and i dont see myself with anyone else but i feel like my attempts have amounted to nothing. i feel like he doesnt even care if im dead or alive anymore. i came here to see if anyone who would feel and act similarly to my boyfriend in this situation would help me understand the best thing to do for him and our relationship. i havent sent my handwritten letter yet but i plan on sending it today, is that a mistake? im seriously questioning myself because i dont know if anything can even make a difference. i cant get him to talk to me and tell me how he feels or what i can do. im hoping that if i give him enough time and room that hell realize he made a mistake and hell come back but i know that its unrealistic. hes always been VERY stubborn and im sure even if he did regret the decision hed force himself to get over it rather than come to me.",

I can only afford to make one car payment. Do I go and trade that car in for whatever theyll give me an add that payment on to a new Car to save my credit or do I say up yours credit man and just deal with the loss on my credit? My credit is very good. I cant wait 20 years for new Credit. Only one bad account bankruptcy on 10 Gs that would be dumb. So what is it?? do I combine both and make a ridiculous payment that Ill be kicking myself for or do I just stop thinking I ca save my credit and just get a new car and stop making the other payment? Someone has to know what I can do. I know someone else has been through this bull crap oh its so depressing my car is in mint shape and only has 95k miles on it. OK, Im whining. Please help me.

    "title": "My 36M feelings for my wife 36F vanished when I started resolving my own issues",
    "text": "My wife and I have been together for 14 years, married for 10, and have two young kids together. Throughout that time I thought our relationship was pretty good, we regularly did things together, we discussed and compromised on plans for the house, kids, etc, we communicated when things were bothering us, and rarely, if ever, had any fights. For the last several years our biggest challenges had been keeping up with cleaning up after two kids and how to be better parents, both of which were made more challenging by my wife and I both having ADHD. Recently, all of that changed very suddenly and Im still struggling with trying to figure out what I want to do. Over the past several months Ive been talking to my therapist about when I was growing up I often got the impression that my friends didnt actually like me and I realized this had grown into an insecurity where I would constantly seek validation from anywhere that people shared my likes, dislikes, opinions, hobbies, etc. I began noticing habits I had formed just to get that validation, such as watching lots of reaction videos on youtube, and made efforts to stop those habits and let go. These efforts have been largely successful and I feel better about myself now than I have for at least 15 years if not more. However three weeks ago I realized I had been using my wife to get that validation too and I finally admitted to myself that 14 years ago I had been looking for a long term relationship with the intention of finding a partner who be able to give me that validation and soothe my insecurity. That desire is both very selfish and unhealthy, and the moment I accepted that, I felt like I had let go of the last part of that insecurity weighing me down, but at the same time it felt like that desire and the dependency it created were the foundation for all the feelings and love I had and by letting go all those feelings went poof and disappeared. Ive shared all this with my wife and weve talked about me basically rebuilding those feelings without the selfish desire which was there before. We havent had any fights about this nor have I done anything which would create an obstacle to continuing our relationship and Ive been telling my wife Im still sorting all these changes out in my head when she asks. What I havent told her about rebuilding those feelings is, after three weeks, Im still not sure that I want to. The crux of the issue is in order to satisfy my previous desire for validation I would have naturally drifted toward people who are as similar to me as possible and somewhat submissive but what I feel is missing now is someone who is confident enough to believe and act like they are an equal partner. My wife certainly has some submissive and people pleasing tendencies and over the years I feel they have been the cause of many things which bothered me or that we agreed we needed to improve on. Some examples: She rarely enforces rules or boundaries with the kids. If we discuss what rules should be in place for raising well adjusted kids while keeping our house, wallets, and sanity mostly intact I feel I cant depend on her to actually enforce what we agree on. This leaves the entire responsibility of enforcing boundaries to me and often makes me the bad guy in my kids eyes because mom will let them watch a lot of tv while dad will turn it off because we wanted to limit screen time. She doesnt speak up for herself at work and on many occasions has worked at home late into the night on tasks assigned to her by mistake or were her to complete with the help of the rest of the team. She ends up unable to be there for her family because she didnt trust herself enough to ask her boss what the expectations were and then burned herself out working to meet what she assumed peoples expectations of her to be. It feels like she often asks for my input or advice on a decision as a means to pass the responsibility for making the decision over to me. She either doesnt trust her own judgment or is too scared she will make the wrong choice. At one point she told me she wanted my input for what she made for dinner more often but that has shifted to just asking me every time what she should make for dinner. If any of the kids are picky that night my wife will be upset and criticize her dinner choice and say she shouldnt have made it. If she tries something new and I dont care for it she makes the same comment. I try to be supportive and tell her things like If I dont like it thats my problem and does not mean you shouldnt have made it but it doesnt seem to help. A vast majority of the things we do together are initiated by me. If I put forward a few ideas for something to do like watch one of these kind of tv shows, she always picks from the ideas I offer and never puts forward her own ideas. I cant tell the difference between us having similar tastes and her just doing what she thinks I want her to do. Lately this has made a lot of the time we spend together feel hollow, almost like I wasnt actually sharing with another person. On top of all this she is becoming more and more of a phone zombie. During breakfast, dinner, visiting relatives mine or hers, while watching the kids, and even when were watching a move together she is just glued to her phone screen. She has made numerous attempts to break her habit but none have stuck. She has also been on medication for depression for most of our relationship and her current state is about the middle ground from what Ive seen. Shes also been seeing a therapist for I think 12 years now but I dont think theyve been very effective. Ive brought these up to her in the past and in the last three weeks and she is trying to put forth some effort to change but I can already see her slipping back into old patterns again. And the most damning thing is, I cant envision her actually changing. Im not seeking advice on if or how I can fix my feelings of the relationship, Im sure I can. Nor am I asking if I should, so I guess the advice Im looking for is what questions can I ask myself/what actions can I take that might help me decide which way I want to go? I mostly feel I cant keep leaving my wife and family in the limbo of not knowing if I want to stay married to my wife. TLDR Got into relationship to fill hole due to insecurities, improved self and am filling hole on my own. Unsure where that leaves my marriage and unsure of what other things I should consider to help figure out what I want to do.",

    "text": "Hi everyone! Im currently dealing with a situation working for my best friend and its causing some tension between us. It all started when my friend lost a big contract that was steady income for him. He decided to take a full time job aside from his business and asked me to help him with his business. I wanted to be of help, so I told him Id help him. He was good at first, and I was very clear about my boundaries and expectations going in and he said it was fine. Its gotten to a point where I originally said Id work 3 days a week. Im a single father and I also have my own business I operate. He basically expects me to sit by the phone Monday to Friday and wait for work to come in. I dont get paid any standby time or a salary so if theres no work I go do my own thing. He gets angry when a job comes in last minute or on a weekend which is the only time I have my daughter expecting me to drop everything Im doing and go do his work. Its created alot of tension as I feel like Im helping as best I can but hes trying to push it to where Im at his disposal but without the proper pay. I dont want to quit and leave him in a bind, but I also dont like that hes not being fair and compensating me expecting me to wait around without getting paid. Sorry for the long post, just feeling really frustrated and dont know what direction to take.",

    "text": "I am a rising junior in college and need to put more footing into my future marketing career. Last summer, I was involved in a professional development program in which I was a social media marketing intern for a local podcast. Throughout my school year, I tried to find relative social media/marketing jobs but all of those were strictly for Juniors and Seniors. Near the end of the school year, I fell upon some financial hardship personal and academic. I am a first-generation and I pay for college entirely myself. I really want to find a job that not only can pay well but is related to my career but all I find is commission pay only jobs or jobs that are in person but to far for my means I dont own a car and there isnt a near bus route in walking distance. I have quite literally applied to over 100 jobs this summers, and have received many interviews but they all were commission paying jobs. I need something more stable so that I can be positive I can afford to go to college next semester. Ive used LinkedIn and Indeed mostly for job applications, as well as SideShift. If I can possibly be introduced to new jobs or any tips to earn high commissions, or just in general, that would be amazing.",

    "text": "For context me, 24M, and my gf, 22F have been dating long distance for about 2 1/2 years. I go up to visit her every weekend as we dont live too terribly far from each other. She gets incredibly irritable super fast, at any minor inconvenience. For example, she has to give her cat meds and anytime the cat spits the pill out she completely flips out. Shell call her cat a red or fat and starts yelling at it and starts going off about how the meds were just invented by big pharma and that they only make her give the cat the meds so she has to keep paying. Its like this for every problem, its always a huge reaction and someone elses fault. Like the other day she was driving and someone did something stupid and she said I wish I could hit them with my car, and then get out and beat them up. Shes also recently started arguing with people online. She will get into these huge arguments over something that could have easily just be scrolled past. She will get their name and then search up their number and then sign them up for spam texts or message their family with the screenshots of their comments, or message the person their address. She also gets mad at her roommate for making food that she doesnt like and asking her if she wants any. She says they do this on purpose and tells me the roommate gets mad every time she declines. She throws a fit that they didnt make something shed actually like and asked anyways and why they cant just set some aside made differently so that she can have some. Anytime she gets made she always takes it out on me. Shell get cold and annoyed and we will just sit in silence for hours and then shell get mad that we wasted the whole night or if were on the phone shell get mad that I dont say anything. What am I supposed to say when anything and everything upsets her? Why would I talk just to get one worded aggressive responses? Then shell just go back to being all lovey dovey like nothing happened. Doesnt acknowledge it or apologize or anything.",

Problem is every time I look for joint loans it requires both parties to have an income. Im unemployed but when I select that option all of them still ask for my income. The reason were putting me on there is because my credit score is better than his. All of the debt is in my name so its been growing my credit not his for the last few years. He wont get approved with his credit history alone. So I was just wondering if theres any joint loans that dont require both parties to have an income. Im not looking to be talked out of it. I know we could do other options. We want to go this route. We would do a bank loan but the bank wont lend us more that 3000 cuz thats theyre cap on personal loans.",

    "text": "Basically when i was in 8th grade i was on shedtwt and got into some rlly bad communities. I had a lot of guys texting me and asking for nudes, which i didnt send at first, i only sent them to the ones i got to know. Later on, i realized the only reason i was doing that stuff was bc i was desperate for validation and thought it was the only way somebody could love me, so i stopped and I blocked all of the guys i sent to. It was peaceful until one of the guys i sent to msged me on a new acc threatening to leak my nudes and send them to my parents. I got really panicked so i did the disgusting stuff he asked me to do and he left me alone. Later a guy msged me abt how my nudes were being sold on telegram for bitcoin and shit like that. I deleted twt and went into 9th grade trying to forget abt all of that, when i fell back into those habits during winter break. A guy had friended me on snapchat so we started talking and eventually we started exchanging nudes. I was so stupid cuz i genuinely thought he loved me even tho he would ignore me except for when he wanted nudes. I ended up getting leaked and everyone at my school was talking about it. I havent sent anything after that, and im going to a new school sophomore year. I made the cheer team and im excited for all of my classes, but im falling back into old habits again. Like masturbating every day and constantly watching porn. Its really tempting to start sending again bc idk im rlly lonely and i find it hard to believe im worth more than my body since ive never had a relationship where it wasnt just about my body. I just dont know what to do atp idk this is rlly embarrassing bc this isnt normal but i need to talk abt it",

    "title": "Is my dad in the wrong for this and how can I help him?",
    "text": "So since January, Ive moved out my parents house. Ive been in touch with my family and every time Ill talk with my dad, hell tell me business is slow. I just talked with him on the phone and he wants me to post a car he wants to sell on Facebook. However, I realized that everytime Ill go on his Facebook reviews, it has a negative rating with people saying he lied to them or hes ripping them off. When I used to live with my parents, Ill assist him in cleaning used cars we would get from a used dealership and taking it to people who wanted it. However, hell get cars with major issues at times or a lot of minor issues, and basically have me post it on my Facebook to sell and tell people theres nothing wrong with it and were selling it as is. I didnt feel right about this cause I dont like lying to people but at the same time Im trying to help my dad and his business. I understand he needs to make profit and were living it desperate times right now, but doesnt it make your business look bad if you constantly get negative reviews? Also, I started to believe people in our neighborhood at the time were jealous and wanted to see us fail because theyll complain about us having cars parked due to HOA rules, like on a consistent basis. I also feel like the reason his business isnt working good could be due to the fact that the people who might have felt he ripped them off had bad karma against him or it could be witchcraft. Im really just speculating at this point man. When I used to live back home with my parents, I would help him bring lots of used cars he bought from the dealership back home, and would dedicate slot of my time washing, cleaning and detailing it to be sold, but since I left, he has no one to really help him out and I think that might be affecting his business. How can I help him at this point?",

When we brought the house I put down majority of the deposit and put a declaration of trust in to show I had more share in the house , we have only been in the house about a year so Im unsure if I will get what I put in back. I guess the question is Im only 23 and Im stressed what I should do next after this , should I go into renting for a while ? Or maybe put the money from this house done on another for myself ? I have no parents so going back to family isnt an option for me. Any advice would be appreciated.",

    "title": "Why do the Chinese think they have a civilization?",
    "text": "China maybe Not a Civilization, but rather a Barbaric-ization. Abstract: This essay argues that what is commonly regarded as Chinese civilization lacks the essential intellectual infrastructure of a true civilization. It does not rest on rational methodology, dialectical inquiry, or institutional openness. Instead, it reflects a form of barbaricizationa stagnation and distortion of culture devoid of self-correcting knowledge mechanisms. 1. Absence of Dialectical Method and Epistemological Foundations The foundation of Western civilization lies not in its institutions alone but in the intellectual methods that shaped them. Socratic dialectic, as practiced in the Greek polis, emphasized open debate, contradiction, and questioningseen in Platos dialogues and Aristotles logical treatises Organon. These laid the groundwork for what later became the scientific method. In contrast, classical Chinese thought lacked structured epistemology. Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalismwhile diversedid not institutionalize adversarial discourse. Confucius Analects speaks in maxims, not arguments. Sun Tzu The Art of War offers strategic assertions, rarely justifying why his principles are preferable. These are aphoristic, not analytic traditions. Although the Jixia Academy ca. 4th century BCE allowed scholars of different schools to reside and converse, there is no evidence of sustained dialectical engagement comparable to the Greek agora. Chinese intellectual culture remained monologic, valuing harmony over contradiction, which Confucius himself praised: The gentleman seeks harmony, not uniformity Analects, 13:23a value that, ironically, discouraged the clash of ideas essential to methodological progress. 2. The Myth of Scientific Progress Without Method Chinas early technological inventionspaper, gunpowder, the compassare often cited as signs of scientific advancement. But these were not products of a systematic scientific community. As Joseph Needham observed, while China made great discoveries, it failed to develop theoretical science comparable to Europes post-Socratic traditions. This stagnation is explained by the lack of method. In Europe, thinkers from Alhazen to Galileo developed falsifiable models and experimental systems. In contrast, Chinese knowledge remained empirical and artisanal. Once a discovery was made, it was revered, not improved upon. The reverence of figures like Shen Kuo or Zhang Heng turned them into near-mystics rather than scientists whose work could be questioned or extended. The result is civilizational stagnation: instead of paradigms being refined, individuals became legends. The inability to reconstruct or surpass earlier innovations reflects not a lack of talent, but a lack of epistemic infrastructure. 3. From Critical Thinking to Speculative Dogma Chinese philosophical texts are often rich in ethical thought but lack reflectivity. Critical theoryunderstood as the interrogation of premisesis absent. Assertions are made without counterarguments or burden of proof. As an example, Confucius claims: If the people be led by laws they will try to avoid punishment but have no sense of shame Analects, 2:3. Yet he offers no evidence that moral leadership is more effective than legal enforcement. This style of maxims dominates Chinese scholarship, reducing argument to proclamation. Without falsification or opposition, Chinese thought regressed into a rhetorical tradition susceptible to logical fallacies like confirmation bias and cherry-picking. This intellectual closure is what Karl Popper termed closed societies, where knowledge is stagnant because it is never challenged. 4. The Corruption of Merit and the Centralization of Flattery Imperial China developed one of the earliest meritocratic systems via the civil service exam. However, merit was defined in narrow terms: mastery of Confucian texts and political orthodoxy. As historian Benjamin Elman notes, the exams discouraged independent thinking and rewarded obedience. This system produced scholar-officials who excelled in moral exegesis but not in innovation. Thinkers like Machiavelli The Prince engaged directly with political realism and ambiguity Chinese statecraft, by contrast, remained locked in moral absolutism. The absence of political theory outside loyalty to the emperor neutered Chinese intellectual life. 5. Material Prosperity Without Intellectual Infrastructure Chinas imperial wealth is often interpreted as a civilizational achievement. But its material prosperity was primarily due to geographic luck: the North China Plain and Yangtze Delta are among the worlds most fertile regions. Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel emphasizes the role of geography in early state formation. Chinas capacity for mass agriculture, not superior governance or science, explains its historical wealth. It is a case of lottery wealth, not intellectual capital. As with a poor man winning the lottery, the wealth was consumed rather than reinvested into sustainable knowledge. 6. The Mongol Contrast: Barbarity with Structural Clarity Ironically, the Mongol Yuan dynastyregarded as barbarianinstituted policies that improved freedom and innovation. They decentralized censorship, tolerated religious pluralism, and allowed market growth. Figures like merchant Shen Wansan rose to prominence during Yuan rule, and popular literature like The Romance of the Three Kingdoms flourished. In contrast, the Ming dynasty reasserted central authority and surveillance, crushing intellectual and commercial freedom in the name of cultural superiority. Their obsession with order brought uniformity but stifled creativity. Civilization, if anything, declined when the so-called civilized Han reasserted control. 7. Contemporary Science as Tactical Imitation In the 21st century, China excels in applied science and technologybut only as a state tool. The underlying ethos of scienceskepticism, openness, falsifiabilityis still alien to its academic institutions. Censorship, plagiarism, and authoritarian control are systemic. This reflects what Thomas Kuhn called normal sciencebut devoid of the revolutionary spirit that drives paradigm shifts. Chinas science is a function of geopolitics, not epistemic commitment. Should Western pressure disappear, the regime would likely revert to ideological orthodoxy and bureaucratic control of knowledge. Conclusion: A Civilization in Name, a Barbaricization in Practice Civilization is not measured by the age of dynasties or the size of monuments, but by the intellectual infrastructure that sustains critical inquiry, scientific development, and cultural self-reflection. By this standard, Western civilizationfounded upon dialectics, skepticism, and the scientific methodrepresents the apex of human intellectual culture. It stands at 1 in the scale of civilizational rationality. Most tribal or nomadic cultures, though lacking in complex institutions, exhibit neither the distortions nor the self-repressive structures of large authoritarian systems. They exist somewhere between 0 and 1, limited but not intellectually corrupted. China, however, with its anti-reflective traditions, suppression of methodological reasoning, and institutional elevation of obedience over insight, occupies a unique and paradoxical position. It appears civilized but functions intellectually as a -1: not simply undeveloped, but deformedan inversion of civilizations essence. It presents the external trappings of high culture, yet internally operates through structures that resist the very features that make a civilization flourish. To call this a civilization is to redefine the term so broadly that it includes its opposite. What persists in China is a kind of bureaucratic barbarismsophisticated in appearance, yet intellectually barren. Until it embraces the foundational principles of free inquiry and critical thought, it remains not a beacon of civilization, but a mirror showing its negation. Civilization, therefore, must not be confused with display or duration. It is essential to understand that civilization is not defined by superficial appearances or cultural breadth, but by the depth of knowledge, thought, and institutionalized critical reasoning. China, while projecting grandeur through monumental architecture, ornate rituals, and historical longevity, often emphasizes external form over internal substance. This reflects a pervasive formalisman aesthetic of civilization without its intellectual engine. Many continue to equate civilization with long dynastic histories, elaborate attire, and a vast, though largely unexamined, trove of inherited texts. But such attributes are insufficient. Rome had already eclipsed Hellas in terms of empire, wealth, and public display long before Ciceros time yet it was only when Cicero Latinized Hellenic philosophical conceptsintegrating rational inquiry into Roman discoursethat Roman culture could be regarded as truly civilized. Civilization, in this deeper sense, is not inherited or performed it is achieved through intellectual transformation. To mistake appearances for essence is a grave philosophical error. As such, any society that prioritizes ceremonial repetition over methodological clarity risks remaining a civilization in name only. What persists, in that case, is not civilization, but its imitationcivilizations mask worn by a system structurally incapable of embodying its mind. To confuse grandeur with greatness, or heritage with critical insight, is to deceive oneself. Do you really Im wrong and Why?",

    "text": "my boyfriend 25m of 5 months and I 28f started as friends/coworkers of over a year. we started dating in late December. around September of last year we started getting closer, we work in the same warehouse. have a ton in common and got along well. in November I transfered to another department and he ended up following me there. we flirted a bit, he would follow me around and tap my forehead and went out with me on my birthday. we grabbed food a few times and hugged but nothing beyond that. fast forward to Christmas, we went to get food and he kissed me in his car that night. we became official shortly after that. yesterday, we went on a trip together. our first trip. long story short, we had an argument while we were there and during it he broke down and told me that he was dating someone when he met me and only broke up with her a few days before he kissed me for the first time. mind you, we had been very close and quite flirty before that day. i dont know how to react. I feel sick to my stomach thinking that I didnt even know he was with someone back then. Ive been crying over it and asking him more questions as we made our way home today. basically i dont know if we can move forward from this, if im gonna worry about it forever even though he waited to make a move physically, and mentioned that they had essentially ghosted each other a couple of weeks prior, it feels like nothing was real back then when he was hiding his relationship from me. are we doomed? I dont know",

    "text": "My partner wants to go to her home country for summer and her parents wont pay for her ticket this time around. She has asked them multiple times and they have said no. We currently split some of the bills. I pay 300 more towards rent a month and cover the car, insurance and our dog. Today, she started asking me how much I pay for the random things I buy like the windshield I had replaced on my project car. Tonight she asked if I could just cover rent for a month so she can go to her home country and she will max out a credit card. I said no, and she started crying and said I dont care and that I dont support her enough. This was pitched to me before but I said no last time, but it didnt end in an argument or bitter feelings. It was also mentioned that because she lives with me, thats why shes not being supported. And that if she lived on her own, she would just cancel her apartment and get another one when she got back. I kinda laughed but I wasnt laughing because it was funny but laughing because I wasnt sure how to handle this whole situation. I was eating a cookie and she was very upset about that, too. Am I selfish for not wanting to cover rent?",

He used to watch TV on that iPad all the time, so I was chronically worried hed end up walking down memory lane while I was sleeping right next to him. So I bought him a new, perfect iPad Air for Christmas this year. He couldnt get his old iCloud to sync with the new one, so all those photos are stuck on the old iPad we gave it to his son who uses it for school and lives away. And yeah I knew what I was doing. Not saying he doesnt still have a few pics of her on his phone I snooped, saw a pic or two of her, her gravestone, and what I think is a photo of the burial plot next to hers thats supposedly his. But if we last into old age, Im pretty sure Ill outlive him. No WAY is he getting buried there. Hes never said anything, but I think he knows. And honestly, I appreciate that he doesnt make a thing out of it. Marriage has all these little nuances. He tolerates and accommodates my insecurity, I get to be a little crafty, and it works. It actually makes me love him more that despite my flaws he doesnt hold that against me.",
