    "text": "So I just started a job where we just unpack stock, I have 3 days under my belt, and its a lot of memorization needed, but my managers say Im picking things up really quickly. Apparently not good enough for these 2 coworkers of mine. Theyre 2 middle aged women, and for context, they only speak Spanish, and I only speak English, so the language barrier is intense. When I cant understand what is being said, they just talk louder and faster- like... thats not helping Im taking online classes to learn tho- One coworker is bilingual, and on my first day when I didnt understand what the woman was saying, she apparently started muttering that Im stupid af and the other was just agreeing. And... I shouldnt let it get to me, but it does. Most of my workplace speak Spanish, where English is the minority, and its been such an eye opening perspective, cause these women are mean to me cause I cant speak Spanish, but theyve probably spent their entire lives being chastised for not speaking English, i can only imagine what theyve expirenced. Idk why Im defending them- but anyways, I sometimes want to quit, Im kinda socially inept, on top of being deaf in one ear, so its really anxiety inducing knowing Im gonna be yelled at and made fun too for just not understanding. Idk how to handle the situation- advice?",

    "title": "Numbness in back, and legs, down to the feet. However, nothing abnormal on X-Ray.",
    "text": "So, for the past several years, I have had a numb spot on my back, that has been bugging me. It doesnt hurt, and its not accompanied by any other symptoms, rather than the numbness. I have done X-Rays to see if there was something abnormal with my spine, however, nothing was found. However, before I had noticed that I was numb in that spot, I was always slouching, playing games, or reading. I always had bad posture as a kid. Now, Im 19, and I have the numb spot, in my back. And I have numbness on the sides of my legs, that start at the waist, that go down to my ankles. I genuinely want some advice/recommendations on what I can do next. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",

    "text": "Something ive noticed in dating women under 30 years old, im 28 y/o. Things are often everyone elses fault. If you ask a women about why her last relationship didnt work out, you will instantly get the sob story of what a terrible person her ex is. The women ive met or known seem to struggle with identifying the part they played in their own life problems. This causes a sort of cycle of applying the same solution to a problem and continually blaming it on the problem and not changing the solution. I was taught at an extremely young age that identifying the role YOU play in an issue is vital to fixing it. Aswell as the only part that you CAN actually influence and have control over. Accountability, ive always called it. Why is this?! As soon as I start hearing all the excuses and self pitying I just want to run away because I immediately feel like they will never be able to take actual accountability and become a better and better person throughout their life. Im sure some women are great at taking accountability and i adore women. Simply my observation from the majority of women ive dated that they really struggle to identify the part they are playing in their own lives, NOT that theyre ignoring it or hiding from it. This was meant to be posted in r/askwomen but was removed by moderators struggling with taking accountability",

When I asked him about it, he told me he was curious and that his actions were influenced by a long-standing porn addiction. He says he loves me and wants to make things work. Im feeling very confused and unsure of what to do. While weve had open communication since it happened, something still feels off to melike Im not enough, or like I might not be what he truly wants. He still watches the same type of porn that led to the infidelity, and Im struggling to understand what that means for our future. Hes told me he isnt attracted to men romantically but has been drawn to specific sexual acts. Im having a hard time understanding that and figuring out where I stand in all of this. Im not sure if I should give things another shot or take a step back. I care about him deeply, but I also want to feel secure and wanted in a relationship. Im hoping to hear from others who might have experienced something similar or who can offer some perspective on how to sort through these kinds of complicated feelings. Has anyone navigated a relationship where their partner explored their sexuality mid-relationship? What helped you figure out if it was worth continuing?",

We found out through mutual friends he burned down his ex wives and a few of our friends house. He got a hold on Mary after I told her not to continue communication with him but she insisted. She asked him how would he like it if someone burned his house. Mark said he didnt care. So Mary BURNS down his house! Recommendations on how to keep Mark away or how to stay away from him? Lets say Mark truly didnt care about his house being burned down, do you think it was right for Mary to burn his house down? Have you dealt with any sociopaths at all? Tell me your story.",

    "title": "Is this just being a emotional or?",
    "text": "I have been like this for as long as I can remember myself, so since about 10-11 years old, which is a couple years before puberty hit me. Around 14-16 I was actively trying to figure out whats wrong with me: depression? ED? At the end, nothing fit or helped. Eventually I decided to let go: whatever is wrong with me is likely unfixable, and most people have issues anyway, so Ill just move on with my life. Ive been blaming it on the hormones, you know the thing where there is about one week after your period or around that time where you are relatively normal, and the other 3 weeks are an emotional rollercoaster juggling different mental issues and moods. Is this like that for every woman? To what extend? Recently I came across a wikipedia page describing BPD, a disorder of which I was aware of before, but has never read anything AS relatable as this goddamn page about it before. I basically fit the fist six out of 9 bullet points maybe 7, but Im not sure: 1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined emotional abandonment. every friendship Ive ever had in a nutshell even when it comes to middle school, and at some point around high school I figured out this is the case not linking it to bpd or anything else, just viewing it as a trait of mine and I was the toxic one, and tried to cut it off, though it was always hard to tell when Im being toxic and when I am being treated like shit, so naturally I just ended up growing apart with my last best friend this way I couldnt hurt her and she couldnt hurt me. 2. Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships, often characterized by a pattern of alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, also known as splitting. again, every friendship Ive ever had in a nutshell. 3. A markedly disturbed sense of identity and distorted self-image. unstable too 4. Impulsive or reckless behaviors, including uncontrollable spending, unsafe sexual practices, substance use disorder, reckless driving, and binge eating. when I was 17, I tried a LOT of drugs, some of which were HARD. But I was never the addictive type, the longest I ever did anything other than weed for is about two-three weeks, and as soon as I saw that it is fucking with my studies and quality of life I cut it off as soon as it was convenient in relation to my studies, no rehab no nothing. This is probably because I wasnt doing it to deal with emotional distress, some things I only tried a couple times for fun and never did them again because they would turn me into a zombie, and things I described above I did for productivity, and when that purpose wasnt served anymore I got rid of it without any issues. Ive only been with two men, but both of the first times with them I would consider reckless especially the second one, no protection no nothing, though I am glad it happened because he ended up being the LOML. 5. Recurrent suicidal ideation or behaviors involving self-harm. since I was like 12 6. Rapidly shifting intense emotional dysregulation. thats the hormones I described, maybe? 7. Chronic feelings of emptiness. possibly, cant be 100 sure like I am with the other points. From other peoples experience, the second point is very common within romantic relationships too, but I feel like I just love my current boyfriend too much to do that, I never switch to hating him. BUT, I am never physically aggressive towards others, nor have I been verbally unless someone else starts it, and even then not lately. So I wonder, is this just hormones? Do you experience significant mood swings throughout the month, and are the other things just a nature of being a person and we learn to cut it off as we grow older?",

    "text": "I live in the UK and I have always wanted to go on a cruise but have never actually been on one yet. The idea of just being at sea and of visiting a few places on holiday just really appeals to me. My girlfriend on the other hand has said she would never go on one. She said she doesnt like the thought of being on a ship for days. I have exams though my job that I will finish next year and then get a promotion at work. I decided to treat myself to a cruise so I was looking at the options available for next year. I mentioned it to my girlfriend and she asked what about our summer holiday. I said I would be planning the cruise in the spring/summer so we could plan out holiday for the summer/early autumn or I would be happy for it to be the other way around. She asked if wed be going away once or twice next year and I said it would just likely be once for 4 nights as I would not be able to afford 3 holidays abroad and wont be able to afford a full week holiday. She said that I am prioritising myself and not us by planning the cruise since it takes away from the time wed have to go on holiday together and it cuts our holiday short as we wouldnt get a full week. I mentioned that she is more than welcome to join me but she refused. She said I shouldnt be going away on my own and just telling her wed be going away less. I mentioned that she is free to go away on her own or with friends if she wants another holiday but there is nothing wrong with me treating myself. She just said I was selfish and that Im not thinking of her. How would you handle this? tldr I have aways wanted to go on a cruise but my girlfriend has no interest. I plan to go on one next year to celebrate passing my professional exams but my girlfriend said Im being selfish as it will mean we can only take one holiday which will be slightly shorter.",

    "text": "Location: Sweden I am assisting with a civil case where the representative of a deceased estate is being pressured by a company to pay a debt personally, despite documentation showing the debt belongs to the estate. The company has communicated directly with the individual in ways that feel coercive e.g. You will have to pay it yourself, or we will take it further. There is no formal judgment yet the dispute is ongoing. My questions are: 1. Under Swedish civil law, can an estate representative be personally liable for estate debts under any circumstance, if theyve acted in good faith? 2. Are there limits to what kind of pressure a creditor can apply directly to an estate representative before it constitutes harassment or undue influence? 3. What legal protections exist in Sweden for individuals in this role? I have documented audio of the interaction if needed for context. Thank you in advance.",

    "text": "Hi. I am a 33 year old female that is friends with a 24 year old transwoman person Male transitioning to Female. She would tell me that she is angry and sad that she hates her genitalia and she does not want to not exist anymore because she wasnt born as a cis female and she is envious, suici and depressed because of that. Anyway We have been talking over fb messenger and phone for 2 years i am worried because she would tell me that she feels worthless and inadequate as a security guard but a few days ago when we met in person, she showed around her apartment. She had a crown victoria with a push bar, a spotlight and a computer stand inside, on the bumper she had a thin blue line us flag sticker, and another black background thin blue line sticker next to a transgender flag on the right with a pink sheriff-like star on the trans flag decal. Her toyota camry had lights on the visor that lit up blue and white. She had a thin blue line windshield sunshade, in her trunk she had several dark blue winter cop looking like coats, she had a plate carrier that she called it an active shooter vest with a blue line patch on it, another bulletproof vest with buttons and a Security Patrol Officer badge on it. She had yellow Caution tape, a duffle bag on the passenger front seat with a pen holder a first aid kit, clipboard and folders inside of it. She even had traffic cones in her trunk. Fast forward to her apartment, on her balcony hangs a thin blue line us flag next to a transgender flag with the same style pink star sticker in the middle of it. In her living room She showed me an actual cop taser, several pepper spray canisters, several pairs of duty boots several pairs of handcuffs, batons, a cop flashlight, gloves, she even had riot nightsticks, she had over a dozen duty belts of different styles. There were several white Shieldbox boxes stacked on top of each other in the living room. She showed me her G-Shock tactical watches and then showed me a collection of toy police cars and all of her radios. When I told her that she had a lot of walkie talkies, she got upset and told me oh these arent walkie talkies, theyre police radios, get it right she then felt the need to tell me that nothing she has has the wording police on it. She had a lot of thin blue line bracelets, even a paracord one with a customized light pink buckle. When she showed me her closet which had a great amount of womens clothes that fit her well on one side. On the other side on hangers she had SO MANY like dark blue pants with different shades of blue stripes going down the sides. She had a lot of solid dark blue, khaki, green, other color uniform pants and 5.11s She had several dark navy blue polos. A LOT of thin blue line tee shirts. She showed me her Florida Deputy Sheriff uniform pants and button up shirt next to it without any patches. She showed me her California Highway Patrol outfit which were the pants and the tan shirt. She even had a border patrol uniform shirt as she called it without any patches on it. She also had a bike patrol outfit the shirt and the shorts next to each other on hangers. She also keeps and hangs up previous security guard company uniform shirts that she used to work for and no longer works for them. When we were talking about what she would look pretty in and what feminine outfit would go best with each other, she told me that she eventually wants to present as fem but for now she doesnt think she passes yet so when she goes out in public, for her safety and protection she wears tactical boots, 5.11 pants or uniform dark blue pants and a dark blue uniform style polo so that the first thing people will question if she is an officer or some sort of law enforcement and not go straight to and attack her or discriminate on her looking trans. They know best not to mess with me. She walked over to her room and showed me a Cowboy sheriff hat a trooper hat and like a dark blue NYPD combination duty hat without the badge. There were containers and totes which had more gear and like pouches, more flaslights and stuff. There were more duty belts in a cardboard box with more pouches She showed me her interior bulletproof vest and then some strobe thing called GA light and it flashes blue and white on one side and solid bright white on the other side. She called it her shoulder light and then showed me her police radios most of which were Harris or Motorola she then showed me her guest bedroom which had patches on the wall pinned with thumbtacks of several law enforcement agencies. She showed me her Scanner division and explained to me what the difference is between a radio scanner and a police radio is before showing me her walkie talkies which were mostly motorola and some others like Kenwood, baofeng, etc. She showed me Marine radios she said could mess around on and do radio checks to the coast guard with and also has an Airband transciever she could use to mess with aircraft. She showed me a motorola walkie talkie that she programmed herself and used from when she used to be a security guard at the mall whuch she can still listen to and then an iCom walkie talkie radio that she loves to listen to different programmed frequencies on and then went on about this DMR jargon and what dmr radios are. Shes got an AR under her bed and 2 handguns on top of her nightstand next to her bed within reach of her. After showing me all of these things she called herself an enthusiast and that she sometimes gets bored and imitates the hand movements, quotes and what officers say and act like them off the of police bodycam video channels that she watches a lot of on YouTube and also old COPS episodes. She abruptly had to use the bathroom and I took the opportunity to get my phone out and record everything that she showed me in her apartment in case something wierd or bad came up later. The main reason I recorded without her knowing and I had enough time is because In case i should eventually go show my local police department so that they are aware that she has all of these things. When she came out of the bathroom, She told me that there is a fine line that she will never cross and that shes seen police impersonators on YouTube and kept saying that she likes watching and getting a kick out of the whole Jeremy Dewitte serial impersonator youtube videos. She then made a joke out of it saying that she would be the first transwoman ever to get arrested for impersonating a police officer but laughed it off saying Just kidding, its a very embarrassing charge to have and people will see me as a wierdo and thats a guarantee that I will never get friends for sure that way. I agreed with her as that gave me a little bit of relief but I still worry. I asked her why she doesnt just go to the academy and become a police officer. She said that she already knows that she would fail 1 or 2 of the tests, the psychological evaluation and or the physical fitness portion of the test and that she will stay powerless and miserable as a Security guard. She said that she is lonely and Im her only friend so far and that nobody wants to be her friend and that shes feels very lonely and sad and S---idal a lot of the time. She does own an AR type rifle and 2 handguns as far as I know right by her bed. That has got to be probably the most concerning. My question is should I distance her slowly and run away fast and stop our friendship or should I trust her word that shes aware and that she said shes not doing any wierd shit that I dont know about?? I want yalls take on this. Is this just some police gear fetish that she has or is she on some wierd shit? Ive posted and asked other subreddits for a better perspective but most responses Ive gotten from people are really really Mixed. Some people say its her special interes and her diagnosed ASD. Others have said that I need to stop talking to her immediately and run away. Id rather be safe but Im wondering if I should trust her word like she wants me to. She obviously struggles with not being happy or enough but ive never came across this before its wierd. What is your analysis of her?",
