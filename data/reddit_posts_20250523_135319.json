    "text": "I currently have an outstanding balance of 4,300 on my Discover Credit Card. Im making minimum payments of around 70 at the moment and they charge me 30 in interest every month so its really not budging at all. Forgive me, im young 20 and made the stupid decision of using my credit card as a last resort when my financial situation was in the ruins 7-8 months ago. I dont know that much about credit cards and im wondering if theres some sort of payment plan I can set up with little interest or a balance transfer I can do. I have stable income now but not enough to pay it off in full because of other bills like my car payment and car insurance. My credit keeps narrowly decreasing and im trying to tackle the situation. Any insight would help, thanks.",

    "title": "My sibling 17F cares so much about what others think shes projecting it onto me 19F. How do I deal with this?",
    "text": "This is a throwaway account just to keep everything anonymous. Thanks : I 19F have a younger sibling 17F. Ill call her sibling. Our mom 49F, who Ill call Mom, is a good person, but hasnt been a 100 positive influence on either of us for as long as I can remember. For context, I think Mom has Borderline Personality Disorder BPD and myself and sibling are both very aware of the childhood trauma she has. Because of that trauma, Mom is an insecure/self-conscious person which is valid of course, but what isnt is that shes been projecting it onto me and sibling our whole lives hence the not always being a positive influence. As a result, I have OCD probably because of that, and sibling has self-image/self-esteem issues. I also have Autism and ADHD. Both of us are in therapy, but this kind of thing still happens and it bothers me quite a bit, so I was hoping to hear what some of you think. To set the scene, sibling has been dancing since she was 3yo and the dance community is kind of similar to how its portrayed on the TV show Dance Moms. So, as you can imagine, a lot of drama, fake people, and self-esteem issues. Last night, we were at siblings dance competition, where much of the downtime was spent chatting with the dancers moms. I enjoy many of the moms company, as many of the parents seem nice to me, and are nice to chat with regardless of whether I know theyre being fake or not. As such, I thought everything went well, and that everyone had a good time. On the car ride home with Mom and sibling, Mom brought up how she didnt feel like she fits in with everyone else, complained about how sibling kept running off with her dance friends, and how she thinks it doesnt matter if shes even there if sibling is just going to do that. Im forgetting a lot of the conversation because one of my trauma responses is to just block things out completely. But the gist of the conversation was Mom making sibling feel guilty for having a good time with her friends, and Mom playing the victim and claiming everyone was essentially out to get her. Even though I wasnt really part of the conversation, I kept jumping in to defend sibling because its really hard for me to just sit there in silence listening to Mom drill her like that. By the time we got home, everyone was pretty upset with each other, and sibling said something that totally shocked me to my core. It was something along the lines of well I feel that way about my name too, with all the swearing in public. It shocked me firstly because the conversation seemingly had nothing to do with that, but also because Im autistic and generally dont even come to think of those things. I also just dont really care what other people think most of the time, but this is making me anxious. I asked her why that was a problem, and she said well its just not a nice thing to do, especially at a dance competition where theres lots of kids, and friends mom we were chatting with is religious. And I dont want everyone to think my family swears a whole lot. This honestly just really ticked me off because she knows Im autistic, and if this was an issue she wanted me to resolve, she couldve sent me a text or pulled me aside to let me know. Instead, she brought it up passive-aggressively as if I should already know this. Personally, I dont actually swear as much as she implied I do, and I also dont believe not swearing in public should be a social norm anyway. Swearing is normal, and its a way for people to linguistically express themselves. But of course, if you ask me not to swear, I will respect that. But the thing about this that bothers me is that sibling told me I swear too much out of concern for what her fellow dancers and their moms think of her/her family. She didnt ask me not to swear because it was genuinely causing an issue. I never saw it as one because I know that people wont ever agree with everything I do, and vice versa. But her saying that, especially mentioning the religious person, is really eating at me for some reason. I do have to go back in a few days because its a multi-day competition and sibling dances a few more times, so Id appreciate hearing some thoughts on this.",

    "text": "I 24F have been dating my boyfriend 23M for about 2.5 years now and were in a good relationship overall and have never had any serious fights. Today while looking for a recipe on his phone I came across a chat with his female roommate 24F and in their conversation wthere was a casual mention about my boyfriend jerking off to an old mathematics tutor on YouTube. When I asked him about it he told me that his roommates kept ringing his bell one day while he was jerking off and out of frustration, he yelled at them to give him a moment as he was jerking off. Im not upset about what he was doing but it does kinda feels strange to me that he was so casual about sharing something which is so personal with a female roommate. I can never imagine sharing this with anyone let alone a male friend. This has made me uncomfortable and iam also aware that it is not my body nor my personal details which he sharing and i feel its unfair that i have these feelings about a body which is not mine. Iam not sure if I should bring this up again or let it go away? How do you approach conversations about personal boundaries when it involves things like this?

    "text": "Hi, so back in January I met this guy. At first, we would just make eye contact in the hallwayswe go to the same college. One night, I was drunk walking around campus and noticed him a few times. He actually approached me and asked if I was following him. I laughed it off, but after that we started talking. It turned into a deep conversation and just felt right in the moment. We ended up exchanging numbers. As we texted and got to know each other, I realized I was starting to like him. But sometimes I felt Like an option he would take like a while to reply sometimes I assumed he was busy but he would say he be smoking doing wtv anyways From the moment I first saw him, he was my type. He made me feel so comfortablelike I could breathe easier around him. We only talked for about a week, but he told me his intentions were to have crazy sex and get to know me to the deepest level.Before anyone judges during this era I wasnt looking for anything serious just some fun and casual vibes so this wasnt a problem for me. We eventually linked up. We vibed for hourstalked, laughed, and yeah, we had sex Afterward, he told me to text him and said I was different. He talked about wanting to take me shopping, get matching stuffit made me feel good. I really thought we had something building. But then like 2 days later, he stopped replying. I tried reaching out on Instagram and he left me on seen. I didnt chase, but inside I was losing my mind. My feelings had gotten deeper than I ever expected. Three weeks later, he texted me randomly, saying bro whyd you just hit and quit? I was so confusedhe was the one who ghosted. He said he missed what we had and wanted me to spin back. He was drunk, so I didnt really take it seriously and chose not to engage. Everything felt too fast, and I wasnt sure what to believe. He was pressuring me to link up with him asap but I turned it down Then a few days later, I got drunk and started feeling nostalgic about everything. I texted him, that I missed it too and Id like to do it and ofc he agreed so We linked up again, and honestly, the sex was even better than the first time. Before that, he told me how wild it was that we had sex and then nothinglike he forgot that he caused the distance. I didnt say much, just agreed with him. After we hung out again, he talked about making more plans. But then I got home, checked Instagram, and saw he unfollowed me. I felt crushed. I really thought this time would be differentthat wed finally communicate and try for something deeper. I felt so connected to him, and it hurt to be wrong about that. He texted me a week later just saying hey. I responded, and he left me on seen again. At that point, I was tired of the games and decided to be directI asked if he was still interested. Again, left on seen. Now I just feel stupid. We still go to the same college, so I see him sometimes. We make eye contact, and whenever I see him, my heart races and my body shakes. I cant get him out of my mind. I find myself constantly talking about him, sometimes I just sit and cry like we did not even date and ive been stuck on him for months I dont know how to move on from this. Can someone explain what this is and how to move on.",

    "text": "Location: New Jersey, Paid biweekly, My pay is made up of an hourly wage, and a monthly bonus thats paid on the last pay date of each monthfor bonus earned prior month. Example, first pay period is just 2 weeks of hourly pay, last pay period is 2 weeks of hourly pay plus bonus earned for prior month. Last month we had a good month I expected a certain amount. It was verified via an internal system we have that shows how much u EARNED for April. I was notified by my direct manager on 5/16/25, that the company is going to be withholding 1000 from my check I will receive on 5/30/25, because the company funded a promotion that helped us hit our goals. Ive worked there for 20 years and have NEVER had this happen. I was not notified before 5/16/25 about this. I manage salespeople who are fully draw based commission, and they also benefited from this promotion, but they are not withholding any of their wages. Do I get a lawyer for unlawful withholding , or file a labor department complaint. My only fear is retaliation. I have proof of other months where what I earned on our internal system is what Im paid. This month it shows what I earned and a deduction of 1000. My bonus structure is only communicated verbally in January each year and is effective starting February.",

    "text": "Location: Utah, USA My sisters car is in the shop being worked on so I lent her my car for 4 days. She was backing out of her driveway and bumped the neighbors parked car, left a small amount of blue paint, and like an idiot, just drove off. Cops come knocking on the door, she gets a hit and run. The car is on my insurance and her name is not on it because I didnt think too much about her borrowing it. They took pictures, the blue paint came right off, there are no dings. Still a hit and run obviously, and I see in Utah it is a class B, 1000 fine, up to a year in prison. Court date is in a couple weeks. Should my sister plead guilty? Will she need to show the damages to the judge? Should we get a lawyer involved? How should she present herself in court? Is there a way to drop down that kind of charge? If she pleads guilty, can the judge drop the charge to a lower charge? Im sorry, none of us are very informed and we are collecting as much information as possible as we have not been in this situation ever. Any advice is welcome. We contacted prepaid legal but they will not get back to us until next week due to the holiday. Thank you",
