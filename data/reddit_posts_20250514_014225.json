    "title": "NASHVILLE GREYSTAR PROPERTY DISCLOSED MY CREDIT INFORMATION IN PUBLIC RESPONSE TO REVIEWIS THIS LEGAL?",
    "text": "Hi all, Im looking for advice and to share my experience with a Greystar managed apartment complex. I toured one of their properties earlier this year, and during the tour, I was told that if I applied within 48 hours, both the application and admin fees would be refundable. I applied, paid the fees and a deposit only because they system didnt allow me to opt out of the deposit even though the property told me it was optional to pay but never signed a lease. Later, I decided not to move forward, but they told me the fees were now non-refundabledirectly contradicting what I was told in person. Its been months, and my deposit still has not been returned after multiple attempts were made. After posting a review describing my experience, the Greystar property responded publicly now hidden on Googleand in their response, they disclosed that my application was delayed due to a credit freeze on my file as well as responded with my legal name redacted in the photo. That shocked me. I never consented to that information being shared. Isnt this a violation of privacy laws like the Fair Credit reporting Act FCRA? It feels retaliatory, and Im uncomfortable having personal financial details posted publicly. From what Ive read, Greystar has been sued multiple times over deceptive fees and refund policies even by the FTC and State of Colorado this year, so I know Im not alone. But Im wondering if I have legal ground to file a complaint or even pursue a case. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Can they legally post financial application info like that in response to a review? Appreciate any help or insightsand Im happy to share more info if useful.

    "title": "28F Future-SIL 32F bypasses my partner 30M and comes to me for emotional support and communicationlike a pseudo-sibling. Whats the boundary here? Whats healthy, and how do you manage this grey area?",
    "text": "My partner 30M and I moved back about a year ago, and since then, his sister 32F has gotten unusually close to me half my own fault but not to him. Their sibling relationship isnt very strong, and since I am more emotionally available and socially present, Ive become the go-to person for communication and updates, not just for her, but for his family in general. I tend to be more responsive and approachable, so naturally, Ive ended up in the role of emotional manager or middleman. The problem is, this dynamic with his sister has become exhausting. She regularly checks in on how were doing as a couple, asks why she hasnt been invited to outings passively, and generally inserts herself into our relationship. I realise now that my own willingness to be emotionally available and my tendency to engage with his family created this pattern. I didnt set clear boundaries from the start, and its been draining. Ive spoken to my partner and realised he doesnt want to be close to his sibling, that is fine, i should have respected that from the beginning and and now i am learning a valuable lesson. From my perspective, I am friends with the SIL because im dating her brother whereas i think in her view we have become close friends independently of his brother now. Recently, I told her that I was stepping back from managing the group dynamics initating, scheduling etc and we would hang on a weekly with the cousin too and its gotten to a point where i dont know if im dating the group or dating my partner, its affected my relationship seems everything is filtered towards group activities and boundaries and roles have gotten blurred and refocusing on my relationship, letting my partner handle all communication and plans. Instead of respecting that boundary, she gave me unsolicited advice and said: Thats fine. I just wanted to check in on you. I had a feeling it was like this but I had no certain confirmation. Just reach out whenever you feel ready no matter what the outcome is. and also See how it goes for the both of you guys. It could be a good opportunity for growth in your relationship. Her response made me feel like shes still trying to be emotionally involved in something thats not her place, almost as if she has a say in how we navigate our relationship. Its subtle, but it feels invasive. Its not her place and she didnt seem to get what i was trying to say so i told her your overthinking it and left it at that. Ive now stopped initiating or responding much, and Ive decided to step back from the emotional labour. Im happy for her to bond with her brother, but Im no longer going to play the role of emotional glue or mediator. Moving forward, I want communication to go through my partner, not me. I have trauma from overextending and this was exactly the role i played in my own family and i dont want to re-do it again with my partners family. Has anyone experienced this kind of triangulation or in-law dynamic? How do you set healthy boundaries without it becoming a bigger issue? Its such a grey area and i dont know how to navigate it. But since stepping back my own relationship has greatly improved and we have gotten even closer...I am not saying to ice the sil out, but no one has even stepped up and initiated any dinners or anything, i dont want that role and that shouldnt be my role.....it doesnt help that the sil seems too close, enmeshed with us. the reset happened because the sis and cousin witnessed a very bad moment in my relationship a big fight basically and i realised after that incident, they are too close and i felt very vunerable in that moment and 2 members of his family witnessed that and stayed mainly passive during the whole ordeal. TLDR: My partners sister became overly involved in our relationship, going through me instead of her brother. I ended up as the emotional go-between, which drained me. Ive now stepped back and asked my partner to handle all communication. How do you set boundaries with in-laws without drama?",

I was laying in bed and his phone kept buzzing, he had been asleep for a while, so i picked it up to see who was texting, it was my best friend on snap, which was odd because they never text each other. Of course i HAD to look and to my surprise i opened their snap chat thread to see 3 pics of the exact ring i have dreamed of with a text back that said OH MY GOSH SHES GOING TO LOVE IT. I quickly closed out of the add, locked the phone, and laid there thinking oh my god what did i just do. My boyfriend and I have talked about marriage, but i didnt know it was going to come this quickly. We have been together for 2 years. lived together for 1 year. Ive showed him the ring i wanted many times. Im stressed, excited, nervous But what i NEED to know is, now that i know, it is okay for me to play along and act as if i have no clue? I already know exactly when he is going to do it and where because he never plans trips 3 days after i saw the texts he planned a weekend getaway. Is it best for me to stay absolutely silent and just live it out? Or maybe drop hints that i know? HELP!! I wish a million times that i would have never picked his phone up and ruined the surprise. I feel awful because he has done so good at keeping it a secret. I just dont want to upset him if you say to play along, does that mean i have to lie for the rest of my life and say i had to idea??????? I need advice ASAP, help!!!!!",

    "title": "Is my 22F final straw worth breaking up with my bf 20M over?",
    "text": "My 22F boyfriend 20M is in therapy for anxious attachment problems, and its been something that has caused a lot of conflict in our relationship 8 months. I even broke up with him because of the constant need for reassurance, guilt for wanting some alone time, and the fact that he basically moved into my studio apartment without my permission. He ignored my request for no contact and guilted me until I agreed to take him back for one last chance. Things were pretty good at first, and it reminded me of the beginning of our relationship again but now its back to how it was. We agreed to a strict boundary for now that we will spend a maximum of three nights and four days together a week, because of our habit of spending all our time together and how it negatively affected our relationship. Heres my last straw. Yesterday we had a big argument calm, bur frustrating about how he had accidentally put on my coat with my wallet and forgot my wallet at his place and wanted to go all the way to his place and back, and then spend the night. I was frustrated, and asked if we could just go get the wallet and I could come home alone, since he was upset about the commute. He ended up staying at my place, despite my wishes. But thats still not it today he asked to accompany me on some errands before an appointment, for a max of 4 hours. We had a good time together but we ended up hanging for longer, and he asked to stay the night again. I reminded him we had firmly decided he would not spend the night tonight, but he said he didnt remember the MULTIPLE conversations we had about it. I sent him home ASAP after he started crying and basically pushed him out the door. Now Im laying in my bed thinking wtf have I been doing. Im tempted to just dump him tomorrow, but I dont want to make a haste decision over something so small. Is my last straw in this relationship worth ending a 8 month relationship over for good? TLDR: My boyfriend with anxious attachment keeps ignoring our boundaries, and after he stayed over despite me saying no twice in two days, I think Ive hit my last straw and am considering ending things.",

We were close and she would explain to me how she refused to date, wanted fun with friends, and we spent time together for sometime during the time of her break up we were close she wanted to meet my parents out of nowhere, got nervous meeting my father, when I got back with an ex F22 my friend was heavily against it and telling me to think about the bad too along with the arguments, the boundaries, rules and just wanting me to be happy. When we broke up she acted all giddy and happy like if it was the 4th of July. She always seemed nervous when talking to me when I would offer to spend time with her from time to time. She was being tense and saying yes but then acting distant but later when I was down she would not be quiet, ranting onto me about life and trying to break the silence with invites to stuff and random conversation starters because I was stressed with my career, chaotic family life, and feeling awkward in this tension of her acting super weird but then distant. Later on she vented to me about how she was in love with a guy she met at a bar and wanted to marry him and told him that desire only for him to be scared off but she is hoping to salvage it through friendship. I feel very betrayed as to be honest I did have feelings for her after all the time we spent together, I loved her personality, the connection we had, and the possibilities. I want to severe ties with her as it feels rather unhealthy to be given these mixed signals then be revealed that none of it probably mattered. However, going about it is what I am confused about.",

    "title": "Help! I wish my sister never married my bro in law. What should we do now !!",
    "text": "I am a f 23 and I have a sister lets call her Sam26. A little background we are from a happy family where our parents especially my father has treated us with utmost care and has always raised us equal to boys never discriminating and has always took pride in us even though it is mostly uncommon in Muslim community except some of the angelic men like my father who gives every freedom. We were looking matches for my sister.She is a brown girl with normal looks and she looks fine.As you know a typical myth that all muslims are fair we got rejected by many proposals,we rejected some as initially we were picky too. The only criteria my parents had was a guy with average looks without a full bald head and below 30 with a well paid job and good family.After 2 years of more rejections and rejecting finally we got a match of my now bro in law who is below 30, fair with not so good hairline but he was good looking, not a well paid job as he is still in the initial stages beleiving the pay will be increased in future we accepted the match as even my parents and sister was also exhausted. Bro in law- lets call him bich..uh sry cant help as it was a better reference...lets call him BOB. Now bob comes from a family of 2 sisters both married1 mother 1 aunt and he lost his father when he was 15. So mostly all female. Everyone said they are good people and said all the nicer things and considerig their background, status everything was fine so we proceeded with the match and they got engaged.We gave a hefty amount as the dowry considering they were well off too. There was a 3 months of gap to their engagement and marriage. After engagement both my sister and him started talking more and clicked instantly. Although nervous at first he made my sister to be at ease and was friendly and everything was fine. They discussed about their future he said many things like how he will be a support to her and will always make her happy,he said he doesnt have any problem with her color,or physical appearance too. My sister said he was understanding and is truly happy with him which she didnt realise were never happening. There were some points which we missed is that he was always scared of the elders in his home like when she asked to have a pre wedding photoshoot he said my mother and aunt wont agree even on wedding day he was so unease and scared to take the wedding pics ...its a wedding day for God sake yet the reason he says is that they were very religious and wont approve of the close poses when they were buying wedding dresses as we have a tradition of buying each other wedding dress he chose the least priced one 4k for my sister saying his mother said you will be wearing it for one day and later on will be kept aside so no need to waste money but when it was his turn they took 10k from us for the dress. Although sceptical my sister accepted and got a dress in that price.Anything to be done even to buy a small 100rs thing need to be discussed with his mother and must be taken permission from sisters which felt really annoying but as he said they were really close and shared everything after their fathers demise which made my sister to accept it thinking she would also be the priority after the marriage. And so finally the wedding happened with lots of disagreements and situations which will take a day to discuss. So after the wedding everything was going fine for the initial days and then the torture started. First all the female gang bobs mother, aunt and his younger sister who is married with 2 kids and stays in the same town always stays with them and will be gone to just sleep in her house. Those 2 kids, her with her husband will be eating in bobs house. Technically bobs mom is raising them all even though her daughter is well off having both her and her husband with high paid jobs .she is like a parasite who always takes and never gives and is piling her income buying assets and all. The reason bobs mother tells is she is a working women and cant handle all the work and kids to which bob gives his full support. The female gang completely started criticizing my sister for her color saying dont wear dark colors wear only light colours as you are black in color. And when she did wear dark colored clothes sometimes they will be taunting her the whole day saying look how black you look in this...it is too dark for you...you look bad ...and always telling her Apply this paste or use this soap you will be fair they told this like suggesting but it hurt my sister so bad and when she told bob he was like whatever they say is always for your good. Having no support she ignored those comments eventhough she felt hurt. My sister is also a working women and after the marriage took wfh and started working. Eventhough working she use to participate in small chores and asked to help in cooking to which bobs mother sweetly rejected saying you never worked in your mothers place so this is just the same as it. Even after that she insisted to which they always refused. How sweet right !!! Absolutely not. She complained to her daughters saying recently she is having lot of work and my sister is not helping in doing anything. And then the sisters told bob who is an absolute idiot fought with her which was the start of hell. From then she started doing dishes every day and helping in cooking, doing laundry etc which sometimes hurdles her work and she use to work till late as to complete the login hours. Now isnt my sister same as her working daughter who cant handle house work and can eat off in her home....uh she is her daughter in law right how can she be the same. This indian mother in laws never change. Then his mother started pointing out all small mistakes and started complaining to bob which leads to fights every day. I remember when my sister cried saying I was happy for just a month of marriage and till today she hasnt slept without crying a day ! She tried to talk calmly,explaining to his mother if you have any complaints pls tell them to me,any fault in my dressing or me inform me instead of pointing out as a big crime to bob but she never listened. Everytime she tried to defend herself they labelled her as a rebellious girl who dont know how to respect elders and husband. They taunted her, degraded her she endured everything thinking they would be shifting soon as they both need to go to office and will be very far and all this will be stopped. How wrong she was ! After 2 months my sister got pregnant as they were planning considering many of the Bobs relatives doesnt have kids..thinking same might happen they planned to have a baby to which my sister was fine with. And now they have shifted to the city as they need to go to office. And then again the fights started as his mother started pointing all the silly things....how you might think as they shifted ...Bobs phone will always be busy as he talks with his mother who will be calling 7 times a day with a talk time of atleast 30 min to each call and the 2 sisters 2-3 times a day with a talk time of 20-30 min. The fact yet need to be understood what will be there to talk that much time everyday is still unknown. And as bob treats his mother like the divine goddess who can never be wrong and he demands my sister to worship her as him to which she refuses. They fought for all the silly reasons. He is also a control freak who wants a say in everything she does from how to dress to what dp to be selected for whats app or instagram. They had a lot of banters as my sis has her dp in insta and her account is private too but he made her change the dp telling that boys will be looking with bad intentions...she accepted and changed it. They have fights all the time which involves his mother and her complains masked as advices, his sisters suggestions masked as taunting to which bob who will be a demon and fights with my sister and when she turned to bobs sisters thinking they will understand as they are also women and will make him understand as bob respects and listen to them instead they started reciting their husbands behaviour and stated proudly how good of a wives they are enduring all the insults and being silenced when they were never wrong. They and bob always ask my sister to be like them to endure all the disrespect and to never talk back. My parents got involved tried to make him understand, told my sister to be patient and have spoke with bobs family Then we got to know that bobs family is so misogynistic and the female gang were happy to be a masochist. They treat men as their superiors and they should be treated with respect and women should be a chappal near their legs. Till now they always said to my sister that you are a women and should not talk back to a man even you are right and is at no fault. You are a women you should always do the house chores and never expect help. You are a women you should never shout at your husband....just because you are a women you should be silent and must endure ....we are shocked listening their perspective. We told my sister to be patient talk with him in calm manner but to never be silenced when you are at no wrong. Be patient he might change. What we all know is a bich tail will never be straight. He got so mad during the argument as my mother was defending my sister he told why are women speaking and that my mother has no right to get involved and speak but on the other hand his mother and sisters are arguing with my mother taking his side. My mother said I am just answering and defending my daughter from their accusations cant you see that all three of them are also women. But still he has to say you are mother in law who should always respect son in law and teach your daughter some manners and how to be quiet and follow husband rules, she learned from you to be like this rebellious stubborn person. He is still convinced that we all are at fault and he and his family are very good and my sister is torchering them. That day after all the argument with a heavy heart and to give a chance we settled and made them understand to be happy and adjust among themselves. Now bob started ignoring my sister without caring about her which is a big blow to her as being pregnant and having no support she is so weak emotionally..she wakes up everyday early at 6 prepares everything and leaves to office and will reach late to home in metro and she will be exhausted considering the pregnancy and did I mention they live in 4th floor without lift. There you have it a next turn as bob is a miser with a less paying job wanted the rent to be less and wants my sister to endure it.She was fine considering the financial issues as bob has so many EMI to pay and need to send money to his mother too she somehow adjusted and we were quiet too .They are well off in assests and properties but they dont have liquid funds expect for the salary bob gets and bobs mother even getting rental yeild from their properties which is more than enough for them still asks bob to send money as she needs to have a luxury food style to both her and daughters family. And now if my sister asks any thing to buy he will be asking why do we need that...adjust for now.....will see next month... considering he took my sisters 2 months salary too for the shifting and all. She has no money to buy any food item to eat for herself as she is preggo and when she asked for any other item like a raw mango all they tell is dont eat sour foods your kids will be born black. Bob asks my sister to give him a leg massage as he is walking the stairs everyday. He taunts her when she sleeps late on weekends till 9 saying are you a women you have no manners which women will sleep till late. Comparing her to his sisters yelling to learn from them . He is also a control freak who wants a say in everything she does from how to dress to what dp to be selected for whats app or instagram. They had a lot of banters as my sis has her dp in insta and her account is private too but he made her change the dp telling that boys will be looking with bad intentions,even though it is just a normal pic of her sitting without any exposing or skin show ..she accepted and changed it. He wants her to call his mother and his 2 sisters everyday and to always speak with them which is annoying her considering everything they did. This has became a huge issue as he is considering her disrespectful, mannerless girl who doesnt know how to behave and even said he is regretting marrying her. This made a deep wound in her but she endured and asked him for some time as she needs to forget all the things they done and accused her and she cant pretend everything is fine when they just had the argument. This made him to wait for 1 day and then it started again. She called respecting him and had a chat once in 2 days but he is demanding to call everyday and to have good relation with them as they come first to him in everything and then only her. If needed he is ready to leave her for them. It broke her and the banters,his words, arguments made her loose all the love she had for him. Till now he never asked my sister about her health or how she is feeling with the pregnancy, he never took care of her but he expects her to take care of him and she has to cal him everyday during lunch to ask whether he ate or not this is also a rule he made and if she misses there will be a fight and when she asked the same from him he says you are a women so this should be normal to you to have a baby. When she said she has a back pain he will say how many months do you think you are its just 2 months dont over react...you are not the only women in the world who is pregnant. Dont make a scene...you are just acting up ... It became a hell to her without any one to care and feeling lonely and we are very scared when she calls thinking what happened today. We are fed up but as this is still banters and arguments my parents asked her to have patience and wait till he changes. She said she has no hope that he changes and accepted her fate and stopped expecting anything from him. He started cooking for himself not having anything she made which hurt her deeply and this started a fight again.This continued and now she has to come to our home to have the 3rd month scan for pregnancy check up and bob said he wont be dropping her to our home as he doesnt want to step in our house. He said either ask your father to come and take you or will go to hospital directly and ask them to come there and pay the medical bills as the first pregnancy all the expenses will be paid by in laws only. My sister asked him to forget everything and lets be happy as even your family also had the argument and yet I am coming to your home and my parents were respectful to you and all they did was to defend me...how long will you plan to go on like this. He said he wont ever be coming to our place and if needed will stop her too. This made her silenced and she stopped the topic all together and we told her not to have the fight and will do as he said. That was the end of it and he now completely ignored her to which my sister who from the start of the relationship was the one to talk to him first everytime they had a fight decided not to be his doormat and was also ignoring him thinking he will initiate atleast once. She did all the work, went to office, came home will talk with us and sleep at night. This continued for a day and now my sis changed her instagram profile pic to her picture as she want him to react and talk with her. Today morning she called us crying that bob has hit her. He slapped her so hard that made her instantly tear up and have his hand marks on her cheek just because she changed her profile pic to her picture. He said how dare you to change the dp and disrespecting him,not listening to him. She stood there shocked and left to office without any word. In all the fights he has raised a hand to threaten her but never acted on it. She never thought he would actually hit her. This is the first time he hit her. Is it her fault! Does having ones picture in the instagram is really that bad. What should she do. Should they have a divorce and separate? Then what about the child ! My sister is crying and she wants to separate from him but again wants to be with him for the sake of the child. My parents are in a dilema on what to do. I really want her to divorce him as this is straight up toxic behaviour and want to have the revenge by dragging him to court for domestic violence and the mental torcher he made my sister to go through.... What should we do as its just 4 months to their marriage are we taking wrong step...are we hurrying things .. Please help what should we do...is there any way he changes..if yes what should we do....if we want to separate and get divorce how should we approach and make him have his karma !!",

We are long distance while Im studying. The issue is when were together everything is wonderful. However, we argue and dont understand each other when were apart. Today he said he feels he isnt good enough for me, and while I love him deeply, I think he may be right. This isnt the first time he has said this. How do I navigate this? I could never admit this to him because itd destroy him. He previously shared after an argument that he felt suicidal due to our fight. I hate that we bring each other such chaos and stress when we are apart. I love him and picture a future together but there are simply too many red flags to continue holding on. What would you advise me to do? How do you know when to let go? TLDR: engaged but having doubts. How do I navigate?",

    "title": "My boyfriend of 1 year wants to propose and I dont want him to",
    "text": "Some preface, Im24F and hes 20M. My boyfriends been hinting lately that he wants to propose to me and were almost about to hit a year. Weve spoken about this plenty of times within the almost year that weve been together and weve both agreed on getting engaged/married once were both more financially independent and stable at the moment we are neither of those things. We live in a big city where rent is extremely high at the moment, and weve recently both started our careers. A few months back we as well got into a huge disagreement with each other in which both of our families were involved and got extremely upset at him which is honestly another reason as to why I want to wait. This makes me suspect that hes trying to do it in order to lock me down because hes scared of losing me, but if thats the case then I dont feel as if we should be together. At the beginning of this week he told me that he wants to propose to me and told me that he was going to get me a ring. I kept hinting at him to not do so yet, till I just flat out told him not to because I feel as if its too soon. I want to be able to enjoy our courtship a bit longer, I told him that Im flattered that he loves me enough to even want to get engaged this soon but he seems to be getting upset and mad at me over me definitely wanting to wait. He said that he wanted to propose to me already and then get married around when hes 24 and Im 27/28 We do have an age gap and Im aware of this, but I told him that I dont see the point in getting engaged so soon if were going to have to wait long to get married and that Im in no type of rush personally. He keeps saying that I always shut down his ideas, and that he wants to do it on his terms. We keep arguing because I dont see it as fair if we both dont agree to it. He says that he feels as if Im not taking him serious and that I dont care about him but I genuinely do, and love him plenty. Ive told him that this is a serious relationship ring or not and that it doesnt change much how I feel about him but he seems to not be understanding of how I feel. Weve been arguing back and forth over this for days, so today I offered a compromise of a promise ring where we promise to marry each other and he keeps saying that its childish and that he already bought the ring despite me telling him previously that I want to wait and that Im not comfortable with doing this so soon. I keep telling him that Ill help him return it and find the return policy on it, that Im sure that he can and he keeps telling me that hes sure that he cant and that I made him waste all this money just to tell him no. Ive asked him today multiple times to see the ring because there are some things that Im questioning like if hes doing it to manipulate me and if he even actually got one since Ive caught him in some lies before. Instead of showing me the ring, he told me that hes never giving one ever since Im ungrateful and that I dont deserve to see the ring. I feel cornered and pressured and at this point I genuinely dont know what to do. He seems extremely upset over me not wanting to get engaged just yet and wait. I just genuinely dont see the rush and I dont think that its fair that hes not trying to take how I feel into consideration. I dont know what to do and at this point I would appreciate every bit of advice since I do love him very much. This is just such a tough situation.",
