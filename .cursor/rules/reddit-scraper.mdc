# Reddit Scraper Project Guide

## Project Overview
The Reddit scraper is a Python application designed to collect and analyze Reddit posts, with a focus on tracking removed content. The main script is [reddit_scraper.py](mdc:reddit_scraper.py).

## Key Components

### RedditScraper Class
The main class that handles all scraping operations. Key methods include:

- `__init__`: Initializes the scraper with Reddit API credentials
- `collect_post_data`: Gathers comprehensive data about each post
- `stream_posts`: Real-time monitoring of new posts
- `check_for_removals`: Tracks post removal status
- `save_data`: Saves collected data and generates statistics

### Data Collection
The scraper collects the following data for each post:
- Basic post information (title, text, URL)
- Author and timestamp information
- Engagement metrics (score, comments)
- Removal status and reasons
- Media type and content
- Subreddit rules and context

### Data Storage
Data is saved in two formats:
1. Main dataset: `data/reddit_posts_TIMESTAMP.json`
2. Statistics: `data/dataset_stats_TIMESTAMP.json`

## Environment Setup
Required environment variables:
- `CLIENT_ID`: Reddit API client ID
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: Reddit API client secret

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python reddit_scraper.py
```

The script will:
1. Monitor specified subreddits in real-time
2. Track post removal status
3. Save data periodically
4. Generate comprehensive statistics

## Error Handling
- Rate limiting implemented to respect Reddit API limits
- Comprehensive logging to `reddit_scraper.log`
- Automatic retry on API errors
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid data
